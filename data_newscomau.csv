Hamas hostage move shocks Israeli relatives,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-guns-silent-as-hostage-release-awaited/news-story/022901977b2d394a4e7f12488c5c189e,"Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a new wave of hostages Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners until Israel complies with a truce agreement, in a bitter blow to relatives. The second group was set to be released from Hamas custody at around 4pm local time, but two hours later IDF announced the hostages were being transferred to the Red Cross. Shortly after, Hamas claimed that the release was being delayed due to “Israeli violations” of a ceasefire deal. The Palestinian militant group’s armed wing said the issues of aid deliveries to the northern Gaza Strip and the selection criteria for prisoner releases were holding up the handover. Israel on Saturday denied that it had violated the truce agreement and vowed to continue the war to eliminate Hamas when the pause in fighting ends. “We will return immediately at the end of the ceasefire to attack Gaza,” Israeli chief of staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said. “We will also do this in order to dismantle Hamas, also to create a great deal of pressure to return as quickly as possible and as many abductees as possible, every last one of them.” The swap is being orchestrated as part of a temporary Israel-Gaza truce. A four-day ceasefire came into effect on Friday and largely silenced the guns on both sides. Israeli prison authorities said 42 Palestinian inmates – both male and female – would be freed under the terms of the agreement, which mandates exchanges at a ratio of three to one. An Israeli official source said 14 hostages would be handed over. It comes after video emerged of the first group of terrified women and children being handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross. The group included 13 Israeli hostages, 10 Thais and one Filipino, and Israel in turn freed 39 women and children from its prisons. “It’s only a start, but so far it’s gone well,” US President Joe Biden told reporters in Massachusetts. In the footage an elderly woman could be seen being carried by a Hamas soldier the short distance between the two vehicles, unable to walk. Another looked visibly distressed as she was ushered by Hamas towards the Red Cross. A young boy, nine-year-old Ohad Munder, could be seen being led towards Red Cross medical staff. Young Ohad could be seen looking bemused and scared as he was cuddled by a hooded Hamas fighter wearing a green bandana and combat fatigues. The boy’s family had pleaded for him to be released in mid-October as they feared he would spend his ninth birthday in the Hamas’ grips. Devastatingly, football-loving Ohad did just that. The youngster’s mum, Keren Munder, 54, could be seen following closely behind him today. A two-year-old girl was also among the group. Hostages freed in temporary truce The truce, mediated by Qatar, is expected to see a total of 50 hostages released during a four-day pause in fighting. Soldiers have been told not to answer questions from recently released child hostages such as “where's mum?” to avoid “overwhelming” them before they get to a place of safety. The advice comes as 24 out of an expected initial tranche of 50 plus hostages was released in Gaza. Hamas is thought to hold 240 people it snatched during the massacre on October 7. Those released age in range from two to 85. They include mum Dorn Katz-Asher, 34, and her children Aviv, 2, and Raz, 5, and another mum Danielle Aloni, 44, and he daughter Emilia aged 9. At around 4pm local time (1am Saturday AEST) 10 Thai hostages were freed. Minutes later, 13 Israeli hostages and one Philippines citizen were also freed. All of them were moved across the border to Egypt by the Red Cross. Egypt said the Thai releases was down to “intensive efforts” on its part. The 13 Israelis released followed equally intense negotiations between Israel, Hamas and The Gulf nation of Qatar which has played a key role in negotiations. Qatar said the group of 13 hostages released on Friday would be women and children. Over the four days, at least 50 hostages are expected to be freed, leaving an estimated 190 in the hands of Palestinian militants. In exchange, 150 Palestinians prisoners are expected to be freed from prison in Israel. The releases are coinciding with a four day pause in the conflict which has been raging for 48 days and killed thousands. It’s been seen by some as a “sign of hope” in a brutal conflict. Palestinian prisoners to be released The freed Israel hostages were taken to the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. From there they will be checked over in Egyptian hospitals and many will see their families for the first time in more than a month. They will then be transferred back to Israel either via a road crossing between Egypt and Israel or by helicopter. Hamas has said the prisoners freed from Israeli jails in return will include 24 women and 15 children. Most of those reside in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian prisoners will be freed from three jails then taken to the Ofer military camp near the Beitunia checkpoint on buses, an Israeli official told AFP on condition of anonymity. ‘A sign of hope’ In the West Bank, the BBC reported on people crowded around the Beitunia checkpoint where some of the prisoners are expected to be freed. “It’s a sign of hope for Palestinians and Israelis that the ceasefire will continue and the killing will stop,” Mohammed Khatib said. “We would have liked this to happen without the hostages taken by Hamas but without them, Israel would not let these people out.” ‘Where’s mum?’ Israel’s welfare ministry has issued gut wrenching guidelines about how to deal with recently released hostages, including children. Soldiers have been told not to answer if a child, held hostage for seven weeks, asks about his or her parents. “Children will ask questions such as, ‘Where’s Mum? Where’s Daddy?’ Soldiers should not answer these questions, even if they know the answers. Any questions should be answered along the lines of, ‘Sweetheart, I’m sorry, I don’t know. My job is to bring you to Israel to a safe place, where people you know will be waiting for you and will answer all your questions,’” the guidelines, seen byCNNsaid. Soldiers and other staff are told to not “verbally overwhelm” hostage children. “The use of simple words and short sentences is important. It is important to convey that we are open and able to hear and talk about difficult things.” The truce has triggered a mass movement of thousands of Gazans who had sought refuge in schools and hospitals from relentless Israeli bombardment begun after unprecedented attacks on October 7 by Hamas militants. “I’m going home,” Omar Jibrin, 16, told AFP after he emerged from a hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip where he and eight family members had sought refuge. For Khaled al-Halabi, the truce is “a chance to breathe” after nearly seven weeks of war that began when Hamas broke through Gaza’s militarised border to kill, according to Israeli officials, about 1,200 people and seize around 240 Israeli and foreign hostages. Mr Halabi had taken refuge in Rafah but is from Gaza City in the north, much of which has been reduced to rubble. Israel’s retaliatory air, artillery and naval strikes alongside a ground offensive have killed about 15,000 people, the Hamas government in Gaza said. Hopes for longer-term Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian agency, OCHA, expressed hope in Geneva that the pause “leads to a longer-term humanitarian ceasefire for the benefit of the people of Gaza, Israel and beyond.” The agreement came after weeks of talks involving Israel, Palestinian militant groups, Qatar, Egypt and the United States. According to the UN, 1.7 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people are estimated to have been displaced by the fighting. Now, thousands of them are trying to get home. In Khan Yunis, they loaded belongings onto carts, strapped them to car roofs, or slung bags over their shoulders, crowding streets to return to their homes from temporary shelters. Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets warning people that the war is not over and it is “very dangerous” to return north, the focus of Israel’s military campaign. But Abd el-Salam Matar, in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, said he wanted to go back to Gaza City. “I hope I can reach it,” he said. “We don’t know if our homes still stand, but we hope.” The truce was also a chance for some Palestinians to return to Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Further north, on the Lebanon-Israel border, calm also returned after regular deadly exchanges of fire, primarily between the Israeli army and Hezbollah. The Lebanese movement, like Hamas, is backed by Iran. Carefully prepared AFP has confirmed the identities of 210 of the roughly 240 hostages. At least 35 of those seized were children, with 18 of them aged 10 or under at the time. Hamas earlier released four women and Israeli forces rescued another. Two other captives, including a woman soldier, were found dead by Israeli troops in Gaza. Maayan Zin, whose eight- and 15-year-old daughters Ela and Dafna are among the hostages, posted on social media platform X that she had been informed their names were not included. “This is incredibly difficult for me; I long for their return,” she wrote. -with The Sun and AFP The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Israel supporter arrested at Palestine rally,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/courts-law/israel-supporter-arrested-at-propalestine-rally-in-sydney-cbd/news-story/025f0d16224da6eb0f9705cf5008a2b4,"A man’s been arrested and led away by police “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he unfurled an Israeli flag at a pro-Palestine rally in Sydney. Hundreds of school students skipped on Friday to gather in front of Town Hall in an event organised by High Schoolers for Palestine and University of Sydney group Students for Palestine, with similar events held in Wollongong and Byron Bay. A video from the rally, posted to social media platform TikTok, shows students chanting “From the river to the sea / Palestine will be free,” a rallying cry of Palestine supporters. The camera pans from the students over to a small group of people on the fringe of the rally who clearly support Israel, with the man at the centre of the video standing and brandishing an Israeli flag while he argues with a NSW Police officer. “Have you got your body camera on?” he asks the officer, who repeatedly tries to de-escalate the situation. “I’m not putting it down,” he tells the officer, before the video cuts to a short time later when the group of pro-Palestine students has turned to begin chanting in his direction. Police and media camera operators can be seen standing between the two groups, before the flag-bearing man begins repeatedly asking the officer “Am I under arrest?” Another officer steps in and forcibly moves the man away from the main protest, before the shot cuts to the man demanding the original officer take his hands off his wrist, as he points in the officer’s face. The man struggles and other officers step in, walking him further away. They can all be seen talking some distance away, while the man tries to film on his phone as the video ends. “Around 1.30pm … officers from the Central Metropolitan Region were facilitating a high-visibility operation at a public assembly at Town Hall, to ensure a peaceful demonstration,” NSW Police said in a statement. “Officers observed a man approaching the large group carrying a flag. “The 49-year-old was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace and was taken to Day Street Police Station.” It’s unclear at the time of writing if he’s been charged with any alleged offence. The arrest comes after tense clashes between protesters on both sides of the Middle East conflict and police in recent weeks. In a similar incident, another man waving an Israeli flag had to be removed by police after a pro-Palestine rally held outside Sydney Opera House in early October, just days after a Hamas raid on Israeli settlements escalated the conflict between the two nations.

‘Cynical’: Jewish anger at student rallies,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/school-life/sydney-propalestine-school-strike-last-appeal-to-get-students-to-skip-protest/news-story/22dd7c487131a4d85280b91ceff792f0,"Jewish leaders say school student rallies in support of Palestine are being hijacked by “hardened anti-Israel activists”. Hundreds of Sydney students on Friday attended a huge pro-Palestine school strike, defying pleas from politicians to stay in class. The event was organised by High Schoolers for Palestine and University of Sydney group Students for Palestine. Similar events are also being held in Wollongong and Byron Bay. Students dressed in school uniform and draped in Palestinian scarfs held signs with impassioned demands. “Stop killing us, we all deserve to live,” one sign read. But the Executive Council of Australian Jewry says these protests are causing damage and the students are being used. “We absolutely condemn the cynical recruitment of children to this extremist agenda,” co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said. “This may be presented as a spontaneous initiative led by idealistic high school kids but we know this is the latest stunt by hardened anti-Israel activists to advance their propaganda campaign.” He said those who have supported it – including some teachers and the Greens – should be “ashamed,” Mr Ryvchin said. “We are deeply concerned for the welfare of Jewish students and teachers and what awaits them when their peers, filled with racist slogans and violent chants, return to their classrooms,” he said. “The damage to our society and to our education system could be devastating and long-term. “That this has been allowed to happen is a failure of community, parenting and education that will require deep reflection and serious action.” Dozens of Palestinian flags were seen flying and countless posters voiced support for the Palestinian cause. “Free, free Palestine! Free, free Gaza,” students were heard crying out. Many older Australians also joined in the protest, but school and university students made up the majority of the hundreds gathered to protest. A similar protest attracted hundreds in central Melbourne on Thursday. Attendees reported that there was at least one Israel supporter who “put up a fight” at the beginning of the rally. They say he disrupted chants while waving an Israeli flag before he was escorted out by police. “Join students from across Sydney to demand an end to the genocide Israel is committing in Gaza,” the group wrote on social media before the protest. “These crimes against humanity are being cheered on by the Australian government. “Bring your friends and classmates and show that business as usual can’t continue while there is a genocide being committed in Gaza!” The protest is taking place without official approval, meaning children will be confined to footpaths and a heavy police presence is expected to keep the peace. Labor Party president and former treasurer Wayne Swan told Today that though the protest was not likely to be a “dramatic event”, there were concerns about “fringe groups” getting involved. Federal education minister Jason Clare told school students the best way to change the world was “go to school” ahead of the second day of student protests. He said schoolchildren “should be at school in school hours”, and his state and territory counterparts had the same view. “The important thing for students is that school is on. If you want to change the world, go to school,” he told Channel 7. “Education is the most powerful cause for good in this world. That is where you learn. “If you want to protest, do it on the weekend.” His panelmate, Deputy Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said social harmony was “very important in schools” amid reports a 16-year-old at Thursday’s protest had declared Hamas was “doing a good job”. “I’m very worried about the activists and their influence on schoolkids via social media,” she said. “I am not blaming the kids, there is some poisonous stuff circulating … pushed towards our schoolchildren, and it is causing some of the problems that we are seeing.” The rally in Australia’s biggest city follows similar protests in Melbourne and Adelaide on Thursday, students gathering in public places to show their support for Palestine’s cause. “We have come out today, people have left school en masse, to say that business as usual can’t continue when Palestinians are being slaughtered in their thousands,” one student protester said on a megaphone. “We know that a truce or a temporary pause to this atrocity is not enough. “We’re not fighting so there can be six hours in a day where Palestinians cannot be murdered. We are fighting so that there is never another Palestinian killed ever, ever again.” Some members of the Australian Jewish community have condemned the protests, saying they believe the protests are a “stunt” organised by anti-Israel activists. “We absolutely condemn the cynical recruitment of children to this extremist agenda,” Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Alex Ryvchin said. “This may be presented as a spontaneous initiative led by idealistic high school kids but we know this is the latest stunt by hardened anti-Israel activists to advance their propaganda campaign.” “Those who have supported it, including some teachers and the Greens, should be ashamed.” A leading vape advocate claims China is waging a “reverse opium war” on Australia because of a lack of proper regulation of the black market. It is Melbourne sparkly new suburb. But it appears there’s one glaring problem with the plan described today as “incredibly shortsighted”.

Israeli spokesman stunned into silence,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-arrests-director-of-gazas-alshifa-hospital-who-had-disputed-claims-of-hamas-presence-inside/news-story/180025e6ecac302bf40d195ebfb4c0a4,"A spokesman for the Israeli government was momentarily stunned into silence during an interview on British television overnight, as a breakfast news anchor grilled him on a looming pause in the Gaza war to facilitate the release of hostages held by Hamas. Eylon Levy appeared on Sky News UK to discuss the temporary ceasefire, which is expected to begin at 7am on Friday, local time, and last four or five days. Hostages will begin to leave Gaza at 4pm in the afternoon. In return for the release of 50 hostages - about a fifth of the 239 still being held in the Strip - Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners. That 3:1 ratio is the result of extended negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and helped by both Egypt and the United States. It is the bitter price Israel has accepted to bring some of its people home to safety. “I was speaking to a hostage negotiator this morning,” Sky News host Kay Burley said during the interview. “He made the comparison between the 50 hostages that Hamas has promised to release, as opposed to the 150 prisoners that are Palestinians that Israel has said it will release. And he made the comparison between the numbers, and the fact that - does Israel not think that Palestinian lives are valued as highly as Israeli lives?” Mr Levy took a beat before launching into an impassioned answer. “That is an astonishing accusation,” he said. “If we could release one prisoner for every one hostage, we would obviously do that. “We are operating in horrific circumstances. We are not choosing to release this prisoners, who have blood on their hands - we are talking about people who have been convicted of stabbing and shooting attacks. “I notice the question of proportionality doesn’t interest Palestinian supporters when they are able to get more of their prisoners out. “But really, it is outrageous to suggest that the fact that we are willing to release prisoners who are convicted of terrorism offences - more of them than we are getting our own innocent children back - somehow suggests that we don’t care about Palestinian lives? Really, that’s a disgusting accusation.” Burley, entirely unfazed, moved on to her next question, which was about the political future of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The question that so incensed Mr Levy had its origin in her earlier interview withDr James Alvarez, a pyschologist with experience as a hostage negotiator. When asked about the constantly mounting death toll in Gaza, and whether it could derail the prisoner swap negotiations. “One of the factors that makes me wonder is the asymmetry between the numbers - it’s 50 Israelis versus 150 Palestinians. That has an implication that, you know, that the individual worth of an Israeli is more than a Palestinian,” Dr Alvarez said. “I’m guessing that’s going to cause problems to the Palestinians.” The two interviews mentioned above came during a delay in the implementation of the temporary ceasefire, which was originally expected to begin on Thursday. A Palestinian official told AFP the delay was due to confusion over “last minute” details, namely which hostages would be released and how. Lists of the hostages to be freed had been exchanged by both sides, the Palestinian official said, citing his knowledge of the negotiations but asking to remain anonymous. It was unclear whether the Red Cross would have access to the hostages before their release into Egypt, and whether it would be able to care for those who remained behind. Qatar, which has acted as a mediator between Hamas and Israel, has announced the ceasefire will go into effect on Friday morning, with the hostage releases to begin in the afternoon. All of the Palestinians to be freed are either women or aged under 19. Israel arrests director of Gaza hospital Meanwhile Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip have arrested the director of its biggest hospital, as well as other medical personnel. “Dr Mohammad Abu Salmiya was arrested, along with several other senior doctors,” Khalid Abu Samra, a chief of department at the al-Shifa hospital, told AFP on Thursday, local time. Israeli Broadcasting Authority also reported on the arrests. Andthe Israeli publication Haaretz, citing an IDF source, said Dr Abu Salmiya had been arrested while in the humanitarian corridor heading towards the south of Gaza. “In the hospital, under his management, there was extensive Hamas terrorist activity,” the IDF said in a statement confirming the arrest. “Findings of his involvement in terrorist activity will determine whether he will be subject to further questioning.” Dr Abu Salmiya, in addition to being al-Shifa hospital’s director, is chairman of the Gaza Strip’s emergency committee. He has been a prominent voice in the international media since Israel began its military operation in response to Hamas’s atrocities on October 7. During those media appearances, he has repeatedly highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and strain on its hospitals – while unambiguously denying Israel’s claim that al-Shifa hospital acted as, or stood atop, a command centre for Hamas militants. “Doctor I wanted to ask you to address, directly, one of the main allegations about your hospital, al-Shifa hospital, and that is that you’re over the top of, or part of, a Hamas base,” he was asked duringan interview with America’s BreakThrough Newson November 9, for example. “This is pure slander,” Dr Abu Salmiya responded. “Al-Shifa is the largest hospital in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The largest hospital that includes all medical specialties – the largest nursery, the largest ICU, the largest dialysis department. And people come from all over the Gaza Strip. “Even now, in this war, when the representatives of the International Red Cross, the World Health Organisation, the United Nations visit us, they all come to al-Shifa. I do not think that, if it were a military base, such delegations could come to the hospital. “I do not think these people are sacrificing themselves coming to a Hamas military base. This accusation is totally unacceptable. “Not to mention that I asked, in more than one press conference, for any international organisation or any human rights organisation, or even any party specified by the occupation (by which he meant Israel) to come to our hospital. Search through our entire hospital, all its corridors, from top to bottom. All rooms will be open. “If there is a Hamas base, let the occupation do whatever the occupation wants. But this is a civil hospital that serves the wounded people.” Israel has accused the hospital’s medical staff, as well as international aid organisations, of being complicit in hiding Hamas’s military presence in the hospital. Since taking control of al-Shifa, it has presented evidence of militant activity, including security footage of hostages being transported through the building’s corridors at gunpoint, weapons it said were left behind by Hamas, and footage of underground tunnels the IDF believes were part of the terrorist group’s vast network. “It is important to emphasise that from the moment the IDF publicly exposed the use of hospitals for terrorist activity a few weeks ago, Hamas has persistently worked to conceal infrastructure and cover up evidence,” an IDF spokesman said last week. Hamas has long been known to hide among Gaza’s civilian population, and Israel alleges it uses structures like schools and hospitals as cover – a “human shield” strategy. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
‘Good job’: Striking student backs Hamas,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/stay-in-your-lane-nsw-education-ministers-warning-as-students-in-nsw-vic-prepare-to-walk-out-to-support-palestine/news-story/8202e14d6c854a9cc4e8a8a76210a7cc,"A teenager has been quoted sharing her support for terrorist organisation Hamas at a Melbourne school strike in support of Palestine. Speaking toThe Australian, the 16-year-old said she believed Hamas was doing a “good job” and said it wasn’t important to “stay in school when matters like this really matter”. “I think (Hamas) are doing a good job. I think they should stand up and protect … Palestine,” she said. “After what they’re putting my brothers and sisters through, I don’t think (Israel) should really exist.” The student, who was not named, was one of about 500 attendees who attended the rally in Melbourne’s CBD on Thursday. A Victoria Police spokesman said the group were compliant with police directions and there were no arrests. Students who attended the rally rebelled against pleas from politicians asking students to remain in class. “We are high school students and we understand the truth so why doesn’t everyone else?” one student said in an address to the crowd of teenagers. “There shouldn’t be a reason for us to be here today,” she said, in what appeared to be a deliberate response to politicians and media personalities who demanded they stay at school. “We’re here today to show solidarity with Palestinians, especially the children, the ones just like us but these children might not even make it to adulthood, and it won’t be abnormal like it is here.” Politicians across the divide have also urged students not to skip class ahead of a similar school strike planned in Sydney. Education Minister Jason Clare said the best way for school students to change the world was “go to school” ahead of the second day of student protests. He said schoolchildren “should be at school in school hours” and his state and territory counterparts had the same view. “The important thing for students is that school is on. If you want to change the world, go to school,” he told Channel 7. “Education is the most powerful cause for good in this world. That is where you learn. “If you want to protest, do it on the weekend.” His panelmate, Deputy Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said social harmony was “very important in schools”. “I’m very worried about the activists and their influence on schoolkids via social media,” she said. “I am not blaming the kids, there is some poisonous stuff circulating … pushed towards our schoolchildren, and it is causing some of the problems that we are seeing.” NSW Education Minister Prue Car has told students they should not be “skipping school” for protesting. “We understand that people feel passionately about a range of things, but you need to be at school,” she said. Speaking to 2GB on Thursday, she also urged university students promoting the strike on social media to “stay in their lane”. “They’re outside schools handing out things to school students, many of whom are in their first term of year 12. They’ve got important things to focus on,” she said. NSW Premier Chris Minns made on Wednesday said: “If you want to change the world, get an education and this is precisely why we have a world class public education system.” “We want young kids to be fully educated to be knowledgeable about the world to form their own views when they graduate from school. “To make school the enemy why striking against it, I think sends the wrong message about education.” The rally has been inspired by similar walkouts at schools in other countries including the US, UK and Canada. Event organiser Ivy, who played a part in the establishment of School Students for Palestine, said the walkout was a way for students to be heard. “Schools talk about politics all the time but on this issue we are silenced,” she said. “We are walking out because there’s genocide happening right now and we have to take action.” It’s a move that has sparked concern in the Jewish community, who penned an open letter to the state government claiming that the move could cause anti-Semitic behaviour, also stating the naivety of those likely to take part. “Most students in Victorian schools will not have a direct connection or a comprehensive (if any) understanding of the attacks on Israel and war in Gaza,” the letter said. The rally took began on the steps of Flinders Street Station. A similar protest is also planned for Thursday in Adelaide at Parliament House. One of the thousands of the petitioners who signed the letter asked parents to think of the dangers before supporting their child’s decision to protest. ”My message to fellow parents is please think really hard about whether you want your child exposed to violence, vandalism and graffiti with a group of people that you don’t know,” they told 9 News. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan said she expected students to stay in school on Thursday but that living in a democratic society included the right to protest. “We live in a democracy,” she said. “Being able to come together and hold a rally, a peaceful rally, depending on the issue that you’re concerned about or the issue that you’re exercised about, that’s a fundamental principle of our democracy that must not and should not change.” Real Schools chief executive Adam Voigt told the Today show the planned walkouts had put schools and its administrations in an awkward position. “It is a tricky issue for them to handle and to handle sensitively and with respect to the way that families are feeling,” he said. “The good part is from an operational point of view schools are well equipped. These are the people who switched to remote learning and did it really successfully. “They are trying to manage the people part of it and trying also to encourage their young people to be safe and I can understand that. “Tensions are high and schools are really trying to lean into their moral obligation at the moment.” The scheduled strikes have also been widely criticised by Jewish community groups. Executive Council of Australian Jewry co chief executive Alex Ryvchin feared the strike would alienate Jewish student. “This will cause incredible emotional harm to Jewish students,” he said. “Seeing their classmates chant slogans, march and wave placards that are hostile to their community, that ignore or deny the trauma of the October 7 atrocities, and which demonise their ancestral home will cause permanent damage to cohesion in classrooms. “Jewish students and teachers will never feel safe and accepted among colleagues and peers that participate in these actions.” Anti-Defamation Commission chairman Dvir Abramovich said the demonstrations were a “dangerous call to arms (that) will only inflame an already antagonistic environment”. “When Jewish parents send their children to school, there is an expectation that they will not be placed in a dangerous environment where they might be isolated or attacked for who they are,” he said. “In a climate of escalating anti-Semitism and a growing rhetoric of intolerance and radicalisation, words and images do matter.” To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

‘Indulgence’: Student strike plan lashed,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/school-life/peter-dutton-slams-victorian-student-plan-to-skip-school-for-palestine-protest/news-story/ccb65e05bc78e2833d515609c4d523e8,"Peter Dutton has condemned a planned Victorian school strike to protest Israel’s attacks in Gaza as he declined to support a ceasefire in the conflict with Hamas. The Opposition Leader said he “completely and utterly” disagreed with students who planned to walk out at lunchtime on Thursday to join a protest in Melbourne’s CBD. “If your numeracy and literacy rates were through the roof … then it’d be a different story,” he told 3AW. “But I think this is an indulgence. It’s a political statement. I think the teachers have a greater responsibility to our kids than to allow them out to march.” The Victorian Department of Education has made it clear that students are expected to attend school. Independent MP Allegra Spender, whose electorate of Wentworth is home to the largest Jewish community in Australia, said the protests risked isolating Jewish students. “Australians are distressed by civilian deaths in Israel and Gaza. It is heartbreaking. But we can’t let the conflict overseas create conflict here amongst us, and our children,” she said in a series of posts to X. “I urge all students to give some thought to the impact their actions may have on the mental health of their classmates, and look for ways to unify. We should all be doing all we can to maintain the social harmony that’s at the heart of this great multicultural country.” Mr Dutton made the comments ahead of an appearance alongside Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the launch of the Melbourne Holocaust Museum in Elsternwick. He said the bipartisan display of support would send a unified message that Australia was a “tolerant society” that didn’t accept hatred on any basis. “It’s just unacceptable that people feel the fear that they do now,” Mr Dutton said, referring to reports Jewish Australians were feeling unsafe in their communities. Mr Dutton was accused last week in parliament by Mr Albanese of weaponising anti-Semitism during a heated debate in which the Liberal leader sought to link the Middle East conflict and the release of detainees from immigration detention. Mr Dutton told 3AW he believed Mr Albanese’s remarks were just “his emotions speaking”. “I think that some of the comments that Penny Wong and others have made have been regrettable, but I think today is a day of coming together and making sure that we talk with one voice and that is that we have zero tolerance for anti-Semitism,” Mr Dutton said. On whether he would support a ceasefire in Gaza, the Liberal leader said he believed “Israel has to deal with the threat of Hamas”. “This is the extermination of a race. This is the hatred that knows no bounds,” Mr Dutton said. “Israel wasn’t shelling Gaza on the 6th of October. They responded to the Hamas attacks. We should always remind ourselves of that.” In his speech at the museum’s opening, Mr Dutton called for “moral courage and clarity” in unequivocally condemning anti-Semitism. Mr Albanese said Australians should not allow anti-Semitism to gain a foothold here as the conflict continued. “Australia will always denounce it and reject it utterly, just as we do all forms of racism and prejudice,” he said.

‘Pros’ blamed for ugly Palestine protest,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/chaotic-clash-between-police-and-propalestine-protesters-at-port-botany-rally/news-story/15b188959308d499cb8fb7e7ff0cdafb,"“Professional protesters” have been blamed by the NSW Police Commissioner for chaotic clashes between a pro-Palestine rally and officers overnight. A child was carried to safety through the crowds as chaotic scenes unfolded in Sydney’s Port Botany on Tuesday night, with protesters accusing police of “heavy-handed” treatment. Officers arrested and charged 23 people from the 400 who had gathered at the port’s shipping terminal to call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and protest the arrival of a container ship owned by an Israeli company. “I would say broadly that most or a great large number were professional protesters who currently are protesting about the Gaza conflict but next week, they’ll probably protest about something else,” Commissioner Karen Webb told reporters on Wednesday morning. Acknowledging the “combustible situation” prompted by Israel launching attacks on Palestine’s Gaza Strip in response to a Hamas attack on October 7, Ms Webb said police had been working to manage dozens of protests across the state that had been conducted peacefully. “What we need to do is manage the right to protest while protecting public safety and cohesion and ensuring people don’t breach the laws,” she said. “I’m not saying anyone’s performing that perfectly, but when it comes to the rest of the world, certainly in the last six weeks, NSW Police have been working hard to ensure that we don’t have violent demonstrations on city streets.” At one point, protesters lifted a pram with a child inside through the masses as its mother tried to escape the scuffles between protesters and police. “A child in a pram having to be crowd-surfed by protesters to get it out of a violent scuffle caused by police removing people at the blockade at Port Botany tonight,” one protester wrote on social media about the incident. Vision of the protest later into the night showed police clashing with some members of the group. One video shows four officers scrambling to pin a man to the ground to arrest him. “Let him go, let him go,” the protesters chanted as they yelled at them to stop. Other video shows officers pulling up protesters who were sitting on the ground and leading them away as they struggled. Police on horseback also charged through the crowd, pushing and corralling them towards the exit. Some protesters described the actions of police as “sickening”. “Violent, unjustified thuggery from NSW Policetowards a peaceful crowd which included children,” one wrote. A NSW Police spokesperson said officers had issued multiple move-on directions to the group and individuals that were “not complied with”. They said officers began arresting people when the group blocked cars from moving through Foreshore Rd in Port Botany. “After a number of people continued to refuse police direction, 23 people were arrested before all people left the roadway about 9pm,” the spokesperson said. “All 23 people were taken to several police stations, where they were charged with the offences of fail to comply with move on direction and damage or disruption to a major facility.” The protest action has been met with dismay by Jewish groups, with Council of Australian Jewry chief executive Alex Ryvchin arguing the latest incident shows that the pro-Palestine movement is “about hatred and destruction”. “Whether they are organising boycotts of Jewish businesses, screaming at ships or manipulating schoolchildren to support them, these actions are a threat to public safety, and they incite violence and hatred,” Mr Ryvchin said. “There is a co-ordinated effort to marginalise and endanger Jewish Australians and rip our society apart and it must be stopped.” Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil weighed in on the protest on Wednesday morning, saying protesters who had “targeted violence at police” were “utterly despicable”. “We have law enforcement officials who put on a uniform every day to keep your family safe and my family safe and to subject to them any form of violence is inexcusable,” she said on the Today show. “What I know is that we can get through this because we get through a lot of hard things as a nation and we do it by wrapping our arms around each other and showing each other respect and empathy and tolerance.” She was then pressed on the matter by the show’s host Karl Stefanovic, who said the government’s calls for cohesion were “failing”. “I don’t agree with that, I think for the most part people are being really respectful of each other. Yes, we have these flare-up incidents where there is violence and I do condemn this and I ask please don’t let it get to that point,” she said. Nationals deputy leader Perin Davey defended the actions of police, saying that they needed to ensure that the port could continue to function “to keep freight moving and industry moving”. “Police are in a difficult situation – they will need to move in and clear the way because that is their role,” she said on the Today show. “They will need to clear the way for things to get through, but any time they go near a protester they will be accused of some heavy-handed tactic, I do feel for them here.” She criticised the actions of protesters, saying that laws needed to be respected. “It was anti-Semitic against an Israeli company that wanted to stop trade, we need to call this out,” she said. “People who are saying we should boycott pro-Israeli businesses, what they are really saying is we need to boycott Jewish businesses and that is anti-Semitic and we need to call it out from the get-go.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Major breakthrough in horrific Gaza conflict,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hopes-for-hostages-as-israel-hamas-qatar-say-progress-in-talks/news-story/e9190cbf43c7b95254390bca008fafc1,"Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on a four-day humanitarian pause in exchange for the release of 50 hostages in Gaza, Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed in a statement on Wednesday. “The agreement includes the release of 50 civilian women and children hostages currently held in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons, the number of those released will be increased in later stages of implementing the agreement,” the statement said. It came as Israel’s government approved a deal early on Wednesday to free 50 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and a truce, according to an official statement sent to AFP by the Prime Minister’s office. “The government approved the broad outlines of the first stage of an agreement under which at least 50 kidnapped people — women and children — will be released over four days during which there will be a lull in the fighting,” the statement said. “The Israeli government, the Israeli army and the security forces will continue the war to bring back all those kidnapped, eliminate Hamas and ensure that there is no longer any threat to the State of Israel from Gaza.” Earlier, hopes were mounting that Hamas could release dozens of hostages from war-torn Gaza after the militant group’s leader and key mediator Qatar said a truce deal was in sight and the Israeli PM pointed to “progress”. The announcements were the most optimistic yet of a potential breakthrough in the conflict, which has been raging for more than six weeks and left thousands dead on both sides. “We are close to reaching a deal on a truce,” Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said, according to a statement sent by his office to AFP. In Qatar, foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said “we’re very optimistic, very hopeful” and told reporters, “We are at the closest point we ever had been in reaching an agreement.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has vowed to destroy Hamas, was more circumspect, telling soldiers at a military base only that “we are making progress” on the return of hostages. “I hope there will be good news soon,” he added, with speculation an announcement could be made as soon as Tuesday evening, Jerusalem time, after his office announced meetings of his war and security cabinets and government. In Washington, US President Joe Biden, who does not support a full ceasefire, said a temporary truce was “now very close”. “We could bring some of these hostages home very soon,” he said at the White House. “But I don’t want to get into the details of things because nothing is done until it’s done.” Truce deal Hopes of a release deal have been mounting since Qatar on Sunday said only “minor” practical issues remained. Speculation grew further when the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is often involved in prisoner exchanges and hostage releases, said on Monday its president had met Haniyeh in Qatar. Despite talk of a temporary truce, fighting raged on in Gaza’s bloodiest ever war, sparked by the October 7 attack in which Israel says Hamas gunmen killed around 1200 people, mostly civilians. In retaliation, Israel launched a relentless bombing campaign and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip. According to the Hamas government, the war has killed more than 14,100 people, including nearly 6000 children and close to 4000 women. Sources from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which also participated in the attacks, told AFP on condition of anonymity that their groups had agreed to the terms of a truce deal. The tentative agreement would include a five-day truce, comprised of a complete ceasefire on the ground and an end to Israeli air operations over Gaza, except in the north, where they would only halt for six hours daily. Under the deal, which the sources said could yet change, between 50 and 100 Israeli civilian and foreign hostages would be released, but no military personnel. In exchange, some 300 Palestinians would be freed from Israeli jails, among them women and minors. The BRICS group of nations including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called for an “immediate, durable, and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities” in Gaza, during a summit in Johannesburg aimed at drawing up a common response to the conflict. Respite Rafah resident Hamza Abdel Razeq said a ceasefire would bring some respite for Gazans who have endured Israel’s bombing and expanding ground offensive. “The people are really suffering,” he told AFP. “If they reach a five-day truce deal now, I believe it will pave the way for longer truces or even a total ceasefire.” Another resident, Mahmud Abu Najm, added: “We … pray to God for its success because the people are enduring an unbearable situation.” Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air strikes, and the territory is under siege, with minimal food, water and fuel allowed to enter. According to the Hamas and Islamic Jihad sources, the proposed deal would also allow for up to 300 trucks of food and medical aid to enter Gaza. Israel has vowed to press on with its offensive, pledging to crush Hamas and ensure the hostages are released. The Israeli military meanwhile said air strikes had hit “around 250” Hamas targets in the past day, destroying three underground shafts in the Jabalia area, which it said it had fully surrounded. Two Israeli soldiers were killed “in operational activity” in northern Gaza, it added. In Lebanon, official media said two journalists from Al-Mayadeen television and two other civilians were killed in cross-border shelling in the south. Israel said only it was “looking into the details” of the incident. The Committee to Protect Journalists said 53 journalists and media workers have now been killed since Israel declared war on Hamas. Meanwhile, the health ministry in the occupied West Bank said the Israeli army killed one Palestinian in Nablus. Premature Medics and patients have been increasingly caught up in the fighting, as Israel expanded its operation across northern Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Israel had laid siege to and hit the Indonesian Hospital in Jabalia on Monday, killing dozens, but there was no independent confirmation of the toll. Twenty-eight premature babies from Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, were taken to Egypt for treatment on Monday. Three others evacuated from Al-Shifa remain in southern Gaza, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday. Two babies died before the evacuation, the UN agency said. The Indonesian Hospital lies near Gaza’s largest refugee camp Jabalia, which has been the scene of intense Israeli bombing in recent days. The health ministry official said there were still about 400 patients inside the hospital, as well as 2000 people seeking shelter. Around 200 people were evacuated from the hospital on Monday and bussed to the relative safety of a hospital in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza. At the packed Al-Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, an AFP reporter saw bloodied children being carried in and lying dazed on gurneys. Criticism Israel says Hamas uses medical facilities to hide fighters and as bases for operations, making them legitimate military objectives, while insisting it does everything possible to limit harm to civilians. But criticism of Israel’s conduct of the war has grown, from international agencies and some governments, with protest marches held across the world. The WHO said it was “appalled” by the strike on the Indonesian Hospital, calling it just one of 164 documented attacks on health facilities and workers since the war began. The UN children’s agency meanwhile warned that fuel shortages and worsening sanitation in Gaza were shaping up to be “a perfect storm for tragedy” through the spread of disease. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

‘Death zone’: Sign war will escalate,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-expands-gaza-operation-amid-hostage-deal-talks/news-story/e1a2c133878d59fdfccc446195f410d1,"Gaza is bracing for a further expansion of Israeli military operations even as cautious hopes built for a deal to release hostages in exchange for a pause in fighting. The Israeli army said on Sunday they were taking their fight against Hamas militants to “additional neighbourhoods” of the Gaza Strip, where an aerial and ground offensive has already killed 13,000 people including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run government. The bloodiest ever Gaza war started with the shock October 7 Hamas attack that Israeli officials say left 1,200 people dead and saw 240 taken hostage. Qatari mediators said on Sunday talks on a deal that would free some of the hostages were progressing, held up only by “very minor” practical challenges, though neither details nor a timeline were provided, and Israel and Hamas have said little. An Israeli strike on the Indonesian Hospital near northern Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp -- the territory’s largest -- killed 12 people, including patients, and wounded dozens more, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday. An AFP journalist saw columns of smoke rising from Jabalia on Sunday, one day after a health official said more than 80 people had been killed in twin strikes there, including on a UN school sheltering displaced people. Social media videos verified by AFP showed bodies covered in blood and dust on the floor of a building, where mattresses had been wedged under school tables. Israel’s military has said Jabalia is among the areas of focus as they “target terrorists and strike Hamas infrastructure”. Without mentioning the strikes, the Israeli army said “an incident in the Jabalia region” was under review. ‘Act urgently’ The violence in Jabalia was the latest to draw strong condemnation from Arab and other governments. On Monday foreign ministers from the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Indonesia held meetings on the war in Beijing, where their Chinese counterpart Wang Yi said the world must “act urgently” to stop the “humanitarian disaster” in Gaza. “The situation in Gaza affects all countries around the world, questioning the human sense of right and wrong and humanity’s bottom line,” Wang told the visiting diplomats. Six weeks into the war, Israel is facing intense international pressure to justify the bloody toll. Israeli officials have warned a “window of legitimacy” for the war to rout Hamas may be closing. Israel on Sunday presented what it said was evidence Hamas gunmen used Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, to hide foreign hostages and to mask underground tunnels. The hospital has been a focal point of global concern after Israeli forces launched a raid of the facility last week, with the World Health Organisation calling it “a death zone”. Israel has repeatedly claimed that Al-Shifa and tunnels beneath it double as a base for Palestinian militants, a charge Hamas and hospital administrators deny. The Israeli military released what was said to be CCTV footage from October 7 of two male hostages, from Nepal and Thailand, being brought into the hospital. “We have not yet located both of these hostages,” army spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters. One clip showed a man in shorts and a pale blue shirt being dragged into an entrance hall by five men, at least three of whom were armed. In a second clip, an injured man in underwear is wheeled in on a gurney by armed men as several others wearing blue hospital scrubs look on. AFP could not immediately verify the footage. Israel also accused the Palestinian militant group of executing 19-year-old Israeli soldier Noa Marciano at Al-Shifa and presented images of what it said was a 55-metre (180-feet) tunnel under the hospital. Over the weekend, hundreds of people fled Al-Shifa hospital on foot as loud explosions were heard around the complex. Columns of sick and injured were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors and nurses, and the UN said 31 premature babies were evacuated from the facility. At least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, were strewn along the route, an AFP journalist said. Al-Shifa head of surgery Marwan Abu Sada told AFP that Israeli troops were still in the hospital and it was surrounded by tanks. “I heard at least two explosions since this morning,” he said Sunday. Other doctors said the troops were going from building to building and detonating explosives on the ground floors and hospital basements searching for Hamas tunnels. Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas and has refused to heed calls for a ceasefire before all the captives are released. The bodies of two female hostages, including the soldier, were recovered in Gaza, the Israeli military said last week. Four abductees have so far been released by Hamas and a fifth rescued by troops. Qatar’s prime minister said efforts to bring hostages “safely back to their homes” in return for a temporary ceasefire was now within reach, raising hopes that Israeli, American or other captives could soon be free. “I’m now more confident that we are close enough to reach a deal,” said Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, adding that only “minor” practical details remained unresolved. The hostages include infants, teens and pensioners. Their fate has wracked not just their families but the Israeli public at large. US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told US media that negotiators were “closer than we have been in quite some time” to securing a deal. But he cautioned: “The mantra that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed really does apply.” In London, the teary father of missing nine-year-old Emily Hand begged for her to be brought home. “There’s just a big, big hole in all our hearts that won’t be filled until she comes home again,” he told AFP. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Israel fumes at ‘preposterous’ accusation,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-benjamin-netanyahu-fires-back-at-utterly-preposterous-accusation/news-story/3f3ea089d61c273296c0b3ed3fecf835,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has furiously denounced claims from the Palestinian Authority regarding the October 7th attacks carried out by Hamas on Israel. On Sunday, the PA denied that Hamas terrorists were responsible for the deaths of approximately 350 people at the Nova music festival, laying the blame on “Israeli helicopters”. According to a statement from the PA Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was distributed to the United Nations and foreign ministries worldwide, “the preliminary investigation by the Israeli police proved that on October 7 Israeli helicopters bombed Israeli citizens who participated in the nature festival”. “The result of this investigation casts doubt on the Israeli reports regarding the destruction and killing that took place in that area,” the statement continued. The PA based its assertions on an October 18 report, which referred to an investigation of the massacre and cited an unnamed Israeli police official saying that the investigation found that an IDF combat helicopter arrived at the scene and fired at the terrorists. According to theIsraeli press, the PA also claimed that Israel had “fabricated” media material to justify its offensive against Hamas. The Israel Police clarified the report on Sunday after being thrust into the middle of ongoing tensions between the two countries. “Contrary to the publication, the police investigation does not refer to the activity of the IDF forces, and therefore no indication was given of any harm to civilians caused by any aerial activity at the site,” a statement by the Israel Police Spokesperson’s Office read. “Particularly at this time, we call on the media to show responsibility in their reporting, and to base their journalism on official sources only.” Speaking on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu branded the accusations as “utterly preposterous” and a “complete reversal of truth”. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid joined the condemnation of Palestine’s government, labelling the statement “abominable and false”. “Today, the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah said something utterly preposterous. It denied that it was Hamas that carried out the horrible massacre at the nature festival near Gaza. It actually accused Israel of carrying out that massacre. This is a complete reversal of truth,” Mr Netanyahu said. Mr Netanyahu also made reference to a recent controversy involving Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, who claimed Jews in the Holocaust were killed because of their “social role” and not their religion. The televised comments sparked a tidal wave of backlash, with dozens of leading Palestinian intellectualspublishing an open lettercondemning Mr Abbas’ “antisemitic” remarks. Mr Netanyahu later seized the opportunity to direct the matter towards Israel’s plan for the region following the IDF’s campaign to eradicate Hamas. “My goal is that the day after we destroy Hamas, any future civil administration in Gaza does not deny the massacre, does not educate its children to become terrorists, does not pay for terrorists and does not tell its children that their ultimate goal in life is to see the destruction and dissolution of the State of Israel,” Mr Netanyahu continued. It came after French President Emmanuel Macron told Mr Netanyahu there were “too many civilian losses” in the current war against Hamas in Gaza. The retaliatory Israeli air and ground campaign has killed 13,000 people in Gaza, mainly civilians and including thousands of children, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. Macron, whose country is a firm ally of Israel, reminded Netanyahu of the “absolute necessity to distinguish terrorists from the population” and “the importance of achieving an immediate humanitarian truce leading to a ceasefire”. Mr Macron also condemned violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank in a conversation with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, the French presidency said. The French leader told Mr Netanyahu about his “great concern over the escalation in violence against Palestinian civilians” in the West Bank and called for calm. Mr Macron also told Abbas of “the need for the Palestinian Authority and all countries in the region to unequivocally and with the greatest firmness condemn the terrorist attack carried out by Hamas in Israel on October 7”. Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 200 Palestinians in the West Bank since the war began, according to the health ministry in Ramallah. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Starbucks store smeared with red substance,https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/starbucks-store-shuttered-in-melbournes-cbd-after-propalestine-graffiti/news-story/19718e9e89dfab298c334a543611b9d1,"A busy Starbucks store in Melbourne’s CBD was reportedly forced to close after it was plastered with anti-Israel ﻿images and smeared with an unknown bloodlike substance. Images and video shared widely online showed the extent of the graffiti, which included stickers stating “This company supports genocide” and calls to boycott Israel. In a statement, police said they were investigating reports of graffiti at the store on Swanston St on Sunday and called for anyone with information to come forward. “Officers are making further inquiries after becoming aware of the graffiti on November 19. An investigation into the incident remains ongoing,” they said in the statement. Companies operating inside Israel or have perceived to support the Jewish state since its invasion of Gaza last month have come under increased attack by Palestine activists. Free Palestine Printing, which produces pro-Palestine paraphernalia, shared video of the graffiti to its TikTok, with the caption: “We will never drink awful coffee again.” In a video reposted to their Instagram, the organisation stated that the store would be closed on Sunday and other businesses were also shuttered or closed early. The organisation also shared video of pro-Palestine stickers being placed on self-service kiosks inside a McDonald’s store, including one of a red cross through the Israeli flag. Users online reacted with mixed views to the graffiti, with some mirroring criticism of Starbucks while other users instead urged patrons to support their local cafe. “I reckon this needs boycotting for the sh**ty quality of its coffee — what I don’t get is why it took Jewish-Arab conflicts to buy our own objectively superior coffee,” one said. Free Palestine Printing is not accused of any wrongdoing and has been contacted for comment. A spokesperson for Starbucks said on Monday its Australia stores were open.

Israel and Hamas ‘close’ to shock ceasefire,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-and-hamas-reportedly-close-to-temporary-ceasefire-brokered-by-the-united-states/news-story/6ddab4e0a430738b406c73ae193e61f2,"Israel and Hamas are reportedly close to striking a deal that would see the war in Gaza pause for five days in exchange for the release of dozens people being held hostage there. Hamas abducted hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals during its surprise attack on southern Israel last month. Those who remain – Israel believes there are still 239 hostages – are likely being held in the terrorist group’s network of underground tunnels. According toThe Washington Post, the looming ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the United States,would require both sides to stop fightingfor at least five days. An unknown number of hostages, likely women and children, would then be released in batches every 24 hours. The newspaper cites “people familiar with the emerging” deal, as well as a six-page document detailing the proposed terms. An anonymous Biden administration official said the US had been “working hard to advance” the potential ceasefire deal and progress had been made, but stressed that the situation in Gaza remains “volatile”. Officially, a spokeswoman for the White House’s National Security Council, Adrienne Watson, said: “We have not reached a deal yet, but we continue to work hard to get to a deal.” International discomfort with the mounting civilian death toll in the Gaza Strip, and repeated demands that Hamas release the hostages, have put mounting pressure on both sides to reach agreement on a temporary pause. Gaza’s biggest hospital ‘a death zone’ As of yet, however, there is no ceasefire. Danger remains throughout Gaza, and according to the World Health Organisation, particularly at the Strip’s largest hospital, which it described as a “death zone”. That assessment came after a visit to the hospital by WHO and other United Nations officials. Elsewhere, a Hamas health official claimed more than 80 people were killed on Saturday in twin strikes on a northern Gaza refugee camp, including on a UN school which was sheltering displaced people. Social media videos verified by AFP showed bodies covered in blood and dust on the floor of a building where mattresses had been wedged under school tables in Jabalia, which is the largest of Gaza’s refugee camps. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, the UNRWA, described “horrifying images” from the incident, while Egypt called the bombing a “war crime” and “a deliberate insult to the United Nations”. A separate strike Saturday on another building in Jabalia camp killed 32 people from the same family, 19 of them children, Hamas health authorities said. Without mentioning the strikes, the Israeli army said “an incident in the Jabalia region” was under review. The Israeli military’s relentless air and ground campaign has since killed 12,300 people, more than 5,000 of them children, according to the Hamas government, which has ruled Gaza since 2007. The UN says some 1.6 million people have been displaced inside the Gaza Strip by the six weeks of fighting, and Israel said on Saturday its military was “expanding its operational activities in additional neighbourhoods”. ‘Extreme suffering’ Gaza’s largest hospital, al-Shifa, has been a key focus in recent days, with Israeli forces alleging Hamas uses it as a command centre – a claim denied by the group, and also by the hospital’s medical staff. On Sunday, the WHO described a mass grave at the entrance and said nearly 300 patients were still inside, along with 25 health workers. It said it was planning “the immediate evacuation of the remaining patients, staff and their families”, warning, however, that nearby facilities were already overstretched. The WHO urged an immediate ceasefire, given the “extreme suffering of the people of Gaza”. On Saturday, hundreds of people fled the hospital on foot on orders from the Israeli army, according to the facility’s director. Columns of sick and injured – some of them amputees – were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors and nurses, as loud explosions were heard around the complex. At least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, were strewn along the route, lined with heavily damaged shops and overturned vehicles, an AFP journalist there said. Non-government group Doctors Without Borders said a convoy carrying its staff and family members came under attack Saturday while evacuating from near al-Shifa, even though it had co-ordinated with both sides. One person was killed. The WHO said 29 patients at the hospital with serious spinal injuries cannot move without medical assistance, and others have infected wounds due to lack of antibiotics. There are also 32 babies in “extremely critical condition,” WHO said. The Gaza health ministry later said 30 premature babies had been evacuated from the hospital, and would be relocated to hospitals in Egypt. – with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Horror blood display at Palestine rally,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/politics/shocking-slogans-and-a-fake-bloodied-corpse-show-fury-in-palestine-rallies/news-story/10e36ba7637f6e28023457c33fd7e49a,"Sunday’s anti-Israel protests in Sydney and Melbourne have put on confronting displays of fake bloodied corpses and compared the Jewish state to Nazi Germany in a stark display of the fury propelling the Pro-Palestine movement. The Sydney rally, organised by the Palestine Action Group Sydney, gathered at Hyde Park at 1pm, demanding an end to what it called Israel’s “massacre” in the Gaza. “We need everyone to help us spread the word and convince more and more people to take a stand and fight to stop this genocide,” the group said on Facebook. A mass of Palestinian flags were seen waving in the hot sun and people with black shirts reading: “Stop the Genocide”. A boy is also seen carrying a heap of towels wrapped in a bedsheet marked with red colours to represent the body of a dead Palestinian child. Another sign from the rally reads: “Queer Jews Against Another Holocaust”. A man at the rally could be seen with a shirt that reads: “from the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free”, a regular pro-Palestine slogan that some critics interpret as a call for the destruction of the Jewish state. In Melbourne, the marchers gathered at the State Library. “Israel has pounded the Gaza Strip for over a month. Thousands of Palestinian men, women and children have been killed, and thousands more are injured,” Free Palestine Melbourne said on Facebook. “All this is a continuation, in horribly escalated form, of the 75 years of war that Israel has waged on the Palestinian people, including 16 years of brutal siege on Gaza.” Israel left the Gaza strip in 2005 and terror group Hamas seized control of the densely populated slip of land, murdering Palestinian opponents to its regime. Photos from the Melbourne rally show Palestinian flags marked out with bloody fists and messages scrawled on red, white and green hearts reading: “end the siege of Gaza” and “shame Israel shame”. Another sign suggests Israel has played the “victim” in world history, reading: “sorry Israel, your victim card is declined”. Another sign bears images of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and Jewish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next to each other, with the phrase: “same s**t, different a**hole”. Adolf Hitler led the Nazi war machine that slaughtered six million Jews in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. The police have allocated substantial resources to the rallies to maintain public safety. Rallygoers are demanding a ceasefire to the war and Sunday’s marches coincide with a possible agreement between Israel and Hamas to cease hostilities for a five-day period. US media outlet The Washington Post reports the US-brokered ceasefire would allow both sides to free female and child hostages. The most recent outbreak in war began on October 7, when Hamas butchered hundreds of Israeli civilians, including the elderly, women and children, in a surprise attack on the Jewish state. The terrorists kidnapped 240 Israelis, holding them hostage in Gaza. Israel responded with force, bombing the slip of land. The bombing campaign, though directed at Hamas fighters, has resulted in thousands of Palestinian deaths, including children and Palestinian men and women who are not associated with Hamas. The contest has triggered furious passions in Australia, with multiple pro-Palestine rallies in all major cities across the country. Some of the rallies have exhibited anti-Semitic sentiments, including a rally at the Sydney Opera House two days after the Hamas attack during which a group of men chanted “f**k the Jews” and “gas the Jews”. Elsewhere in Sydney on Sunday, Jewish Australians gathered at Rodney Reserve in Dover Heights to fly kites in the blue-and-white colours of the Israeli flag to call for the release of the 34 children held hostage by Hamas. Protesters dressed in hazmat suits were kicked out of the NSW Liberal Party conference for calling Opposition Leader Peter Dutton the “MP for Fukushima”. A former Liberal candidate who nearly ousted now NSW Premier Chris Minns from his seat, has been endorsed as the candidate to win back John Howard’s old seat. One of the victims of a pedophile former state MP says he “never got back on track” after being sexually abused as a boy.",
Aus strengthens sanctions against Hamas,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/penny-wong-announces-new-hamas-sanctions-welcomed-by-zionists/news-story/5fd2b102cfddbe36bef43ef31445b478,"Australian Zionists have joined the fray welcoming a raft of new sanctions against Hamas announced by the Albanese government. On Saturday, Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong announced counter-terrorism financial and travel sanctions were being imposed on eight people and one entity in response to Hamas’ October 7 attacks. In a statement, she said the individuals included Hamas members, operatives and financial facilitators, alongside a currency exchange owned by one of the individuals. Counter-terrorism financing sanctions against Hamas in its entirety have been in place since 2001. Senator Wong said taking the additional sanctioning steps demonstrates “that they are actively engaged in the support and facilitation of terrorism”. It is therefore a criminal offence, punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment and heavy fines, to provide assets to the sanctioned individuals or entities, or use or deal with their assets. “These measures enable their activity to be prevented and holds them and those that transact with them directly to account,” Senator Wong said in a statement. The Zionist Federation of Australia welcomed the move on Sunday. President Jeremy Leibler said the government had “put its money where its mouth is”. “Hamas terrorises Israeli civilians and imposes a medieval Islamist dictatorship over the people of Gaza. These sanctions demonstrate the Australian Government’s commitment to fighting terrorism,” he said. “Since the beginning of the current war, the Australian Government has backed Israel’s objective to remove Hamas from Gaza. “This expanded sanctions regime is an important indication that Australia continues to stand with Israel in its just war against Hamas.” The sanctions come as the push for Labor to call for a ceasefire in Gaza intensifies. During the week, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s own branch called on the government to take stronger action to protect Palestinian civilians. The government has strengthened its demands for Israel to abide by the rules of international law, and Australia backed a United Nations Security Resolution calling for the protection of civilian lives, but has stopped short of explicitly demanding a ceasefire. Earlier, the Coalition’s foreign affairs spokesman James Paterson told ABC’s Insiders Israel needed to follow international laws of conflict but the world understood the mission of destroying Hamas was crucial. He said Hamas was denying the people in Gaza of their rights. “They have a right not to be treated by Hamas as human shields. They have a right not to be held as hostages by Hamas,” he said. “It is not just 239 Israelis. Two million Gazans used by Hamas in their conflict. “Hamas has options here, too. The war would end tomorrow if Hamas are he leased the captives. “The war would end tomorrow if the Hamas leadership gave up.” Labor has been slammed for being “out of date” on nuclear energy and having an “obsession” with renewables, just days away from a major climate conference in the Middle East. A major change is coming for dual citizens convicted of terrorism with the government vowing to fix “broken” laws. A leading vape advocate claims China is waging a “reverse opium war” on Australia because of a lack of proper regulation of the black market.",
Tragic find near Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-finds-second-body-of-hostage-near-alshifa-hospital-as-they-discover-noa-marciano-19-who-was-kidnapped-by-hamas/news-story/da3567f2fe3c5730e5b8f651b45bc731,"The IDF has recovered two bodies of hostages kidnapped during the October 7 massacre near the al-Shifa hospital. Israeli troops discovered the body of Corporal Noa Marciano, 19, at “a structure adjacent to” the facility after she was killed by Hamas terrorists. The teenager was serving in the Nahal Oz base when it was overrun by militants. Hamas released footage of the soldier speaking to the camera four days after she was taken hostage. She identified herself and confirmed she was being held captive in the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The horror video then cut to vile images of what the terrorists claimed was Marciano’s dead body. The IDF has now confirmed her body has been found and taken back to Israel, where tests confirmed her identity. It comes after Yehudit Weiss – who the IDF says was taken from her home in Be’eri – was found dead in a structure next to the hospital. The 65-year-old had been identified by forensic examiners and the family has been informed. Israeli military also claimed rifles and rocket-propelled grenades were found in the building. The IDF said: “The national task before our eyes is to locate the missing and return the abducted persons home. “The IDF is operating alongside and in full coordination with the relevant national and security institutions in order to pursue these tasks. “We will not cease from the mission until it will be completed.” The IDF did not provide further details on Weiss’s date or cause of death, The Times of Israel reports. The mum-of-five was abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7. Her husband, Shmulik Weiss, was found murdered in the safe room of their home. Israel has also killed the Hamas monster who spat on and paraded Shani Louk’s naked body through Gaza, her family claims. The mother of the murdered tattoo artist, 22, reportedly told a top rabbi that her daughter’s assailant had been wiped out by Israel’s military. The last time Shani had been seen was when footage emerged of her lifeless half-naked body being dragged through Gaza in a truck as Hamas’s cross-border killing spree still raged on. The claims have not yet been officially confirmed. Earlier this month, the desperate parents of 32 child hostages snatched by Hamas pleaded with the terror group to release them. The petrified youngsters are being held underground in the 311-mile network of tunnels dubbed the Gaza Metro as Israel battles to crush the jihadists and bring them home. It comes as Israeli troops claim to have uncovered laptops containing pictures and videos of hostages at al Shifa Hospital – Gaza’s largest. Dozens of victims were kidnapped by Hamas during the horror October 7 massacre – and haven’t been heard from since. But there is now fresh hope for the captives as Israeli soldiers say they have found photographic evidence of them of al-Shifa hospital. Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told The BBC during a tour of the facility: “We uncovered a lot of computers and other equipment which could really shed light on the current situation, hopefully regarding hostages as well.” He said the devices were found alongside a number of military books and pamphlets the IDF believe suggest Hamas terrorists were there “within the last few days”. Lt Colonel Conricus said a map was also found that appeared to mark entry and exit routes from the hospital. Israel has claimed the hospital is the “beating heart” of Hamas, and this week launched a raid to hunt down terrorists using it as cover. IDF footage showed troops taking in humanitarian as thousands of patients, doctors and displaced Palestinians have been trapped inside the besieged complex for weeks. The IDF also claimed that it had successfully provided incubators, baby food and medical supplies to the hospital. Israel said what is called a “precise and targeted” raid inside al Shifa is a “military necessity” to root out Hamas. This article originally appeared inThe Sunand was reproduced with permission.

Huge weapons haul found in Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hamas-terror-cell-found-inside-mri-suite-at-gaza-hospital-idf-footage-shows-massive-weapons-hoard/news-story/af0903bb5d49bf940a82047a4bf9a439,"Hamas killers behind the Israel terror attack hid a huge weapons cache within the MRI centre of Gaza’s largest hospital. Israeli special forces wearing night vision goggles found their al-Shifa HQ in a dramatic 2am raid. The Israel Defence Force blew off the doors to the hospital and searched the sprawling complex to stop the terror group’s “beating heart”,The Sunreports. Last night, they revealed the devastating arsenal they found hidden among bandages and dressings. They included grab bags containing Kalashnikovs, AK-47s, grenades, body armour with Hamas insignia and ammo. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said troops have been in contact with hospital staff to facilitate the evacuation of patients, who have been used as human shields by Hamas. He explained how terrorists likely managed to escape the hospital without being noticed. “We found uniforms of Hamas terrorists which were thrown on the hospital floor, to allow those terrorists to escape, likely disguised as civilians,” Hagari said. “We warned the hospital management in advance, before our operation. “Today, we also delivered to the hospital medical equipment and baby food.” Fellow Israel Defence Forces spokesman Lt-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said the evidence “totally confirms without a doubt that Hamas systematically uses hospitals in their military operations”. He added: “What we have found is only the tip of the iceberg. These weapons have absolutely no business being inside a hospital. “The only reason they are here is because Hamas put them here and they use this place like many other hospitals for their illicit military purposes.” An IDF spokesman added: “IDF troops are continuing the precise and targeted operation against Hamas in the Shifa Hospital complex, in which the troops are conducting searches for Hamas terrorist infrastructure and assets. “As the soldiers entered the hospital complex, they engaged with a number of terrorists and killed them. “Following this, during searches in one of the departments of the hospital, the troops located a room with technological assets, along with military and combat equipment used by the Hamas terrorist organisation. “In another department in the hospital, the soldiers located an operational command centre and technological assets belonging to Hamas, indicating that the terrorist organisation uses the hospital for terrorist purposes. “The technological assets and extensive intelligence information located was transferred for full review by the relevant authorities. “The IDF is continuing to operate in the hospital complex, while extracting intelligence information and preventing harm to the medical teams and civilians sheltering there.” Gaza’s health ministry denies the claims. A Hamas spokesperson said: “The Israeli occupation’s claim that weapons are being stored at al-Shifa hospital is a blatant lie that should deceive nobody any longer. “The Zionist occupation’s claim that it found weapons and military equipment at al Shifa medical complex is nothing but a continuation of its lies and cheap propaganda.” Troops were given the green light to go into the hospital after US spooks obtained intelligence confirming it was a human shield for its command centre. Hamas fighters hiding underground since the slaying of 1,200 Israelis on October 7 were given a 1am deadline to surrender. An hour later more than 100 commandos — flanked by 30 tanks, countless ground troops and aerial drones — began the battle for al-Shifa. Five Hamas terrorists laying explosive booby traps in the grounds were killed during a gunfight before troops headed to the hospital’s A&E. There, soldiers from Israel Defence Forces burst through the doors yelling in Arabic: “Don’t move, don’t move.” They secured the area and then went from room to room, floor to floor, in search of Hamas fighters, with men aged 16 to 40 ordered into a courtyard and interrogated. Medical teams, patients and women remained inside. In the hours that followed the raid, battery-operated incubators for 36 newborn babies fighting for their lives were delivered by Israeli troops to the hospital. Food and medical supplies were also piled up at the entrance to ease an ongoing humanitarian crisis. Troops remained at the hospital overnight but faced a race against time to locate the entrances to the terror tunnels built below the sprawling site. It is believed some of the 240 hostages snatched by Hamas gunmen are being held there. In a passionate address to the nation, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu vowed: “We will not let up. “There is no place in Gaza that we cannot reach. There are no hideouts. There is no shelter or refuge for the Hamas murderers. “We will reach and eliminate Hamas and we will bring back our hostages.” Their daring mission was given the all-clear after a tense stand-off lasting for days amid growing international pressure. Israel was urged not to start a gunfight in a hospital filled with patients. But shortly before 9.30pm, the White House said the US had its own intelligence proving al-Shifa and other hospitals were Hamas human shields. It said independent evidence showed the healthcare facilities were a front for Hamas terror operations. National security spokesman John Kirby said: “That is a war crime.” But last night, he was forced to deny the US had given Israel the OK to launch its mission. And there was no sign of those held captive, including 38 children, as searches of the compound continued into the night. The long-awaited raid was announced shortly after troops found a mass of weapons beneath the nearby al-Rantisi hospital and signs of hostages. Natalie Thurtle, deputy medical co-ordinator of charity Doctors Without Borders, said at least 300 patients and staff remained inside al-Shifa hospital. She said: “We’ve been trying to evacuate them for three days. It’s very perilous and there is no opportunity for people to leave Shifa at the moment.” This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced with permission.

Sad update on babies at Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/journalists-allowed-inside-alshifa-hospital-as-israels-war-against-hamas-continues/news-story/a0ebf5d58c2bd146ab8dfa8405c1aa30,"International journalists have been given a view inside Gaza’s largest hospital, where newborn babies are among those who have died as a result of the fighting between Israel and Hamas. The BBC was among a group of journalists invited inside al-Shifa hospital by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), and shown evidence that Hamas had been operating inside. There are also indications that some of the hostages abducted by the terrorist group during its attack on October 7 were held there. “We uncovered a lot of computers and other equipment which could really shed light on the current situation, hopefully regarding hostages as well,” an Israeli Lieutenant Colonel, Jonathan Conricus,told the British broadcaster. “At the end of the day, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Hamas aren’t here because they saw we were coming. This is probably what they were forced to leave behind. Our assessment is that there’s much more.” The BBC was shown three stashes of assault rifles, ammunition and bulletproof vests. Fighting continued to rage in Gaza on Thursday, more than five weeks after the unprecedented attack by Hamas on October 7 sparked retaliatory bombing and a ground offensive by Israel, which has vowed to destroy the Palestinian militant group. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Israel during the attack and around 240 people taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. In Gaza, more than 11,500 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed, officials in the Hamas-run territory have said. The Israeli army said on Thursday its troops had taken “operational control” of Gaza City’s port. “In the past few days, in a joint operation, soldiers took operational control of the Gaza harbour, which was controlled by the Hamas terrorist organisation,” the IDF said in a statement. “All buildings in the harbour area were cleared.” The announcement came hours after the Israeli military said it had renewed its military operation at the al-Shifa hospital, Gaza’s largest. The United Nations Security Council managed to agree a resolution on the Israel-Hamas war after multiple attempts, calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses” to allow aid to reach civilians in the besieged territory. The resolution, which passed thanks to abstentions from veto-holders Russia, the United States and Britain, called on all parties to protect civilians, “especially children”. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, condemned the resolution as “disconnected from reality”. The Israeli army on Thursday announced the deaths of three more soldiers in Gaza, raising the number of troops killed in the Palestinian territory to 51 since the start of the war with Hamas. An army spokesman confirmed the new overall toll to AFP, after announcing two soldiers were killed in combat in northern Gaza on Wednesday and raising the toll to 50. It later announced the death of a 22-year-old captain, the 51st casualty since Israel’s ground operation in Gaza began. The toll does not include those killed during Hamas’s attack on southern Israel. In total more than 300 Israeli troops have been killed since October 7. Meanwhile, Israeli police killed three gunmen who attacked a checkpoint in Jerusalem on Thursday and wounded several security force members. Four security personnel suffered gunshot wounds, including one who was critically injured, while two more were lightly injured, according to Israeli emergency services. The checkpoint was guarding road tunnels linking Jerusalem with the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where violence between Israeli settlers and Palestinians has surged since October 7. Raids by Israel’s military, which says it is responding to “a significant rise in terrorist attacks”, have also multiplied in the West Bank where the Palestinian death toll has soared. UN flags serious human rights violations The United Nations’ human rights chief has highlighted allegations of serious rights violations in the Israel-Hamas war that he says need “full accountability”. Volker Turk said “extremely serious allegations of multiple and profound breaches of international humanitarian law, whoever commits them, demand rigorous investigation and full accountability”. The UN high commissioner for human rights did not name Israel or Hamas, but he spoke after a visit last week to the Middle East, where he warned that both sides were committing war crimes in a conflict that has left thousands dead. “Where national authorities prove unwilling or unable to carry out such investigations, and where there are contested narratives on particularly significant incidents, international investigation is called for,” he said in a briefing to UN member states in Geneva. Turk decried the “conflagration of violence (that) has been unleashed”. He said he had spoken to people crossing out of Gaza during a visit to the Egyptian border, and “rarely have I heard such disturbing testimony about the catastrophic harm that ordinary people have endured”. He was unable to access Israel or the Palestinian territories, but stressed Thursday the urgent need for his department to go there, “to ensure full and independent monitoring and documentation, and to co-ordinate protection work”. He told reporters he had “asked Israel to give me access both to Israel, but also to the occupied Palestinian territory. I have not yet received a response”, he said. The Israeli mission to the UN in Geneva later dismissed his request to visit Israel, telling AFP it “did not see any added benefit of the high commissioner’s visit at this time”. During his visit to the region last week, the Israeli mission said Turk had “made it clear that his mind had already been made up, and therefore dialogue with (his office) would contribute little.” West Bank warning During Thursday’s briefing, Turk voiced concern about the “intensification of violence and severe discrimination against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem”. “This creates a potentially explosive situation,” he said. “I am ringing the loudest possible alarm bell about the occupied West Bank.” He urged an immediate ceasefire. “It is apparent that on both sides, some view the killing of civilians as either acceptable collateral damage, or a deliberate and useful weapon of war,” he said. He also insisted that “the Israeli occupation must end”. “Israelis’ freedom is inextricably bound up with Palestinians’ freedom. Palestinians and Israelis are each others’ only hope for peace.” Israel harshly criticised UN attempts to balance criticism about violations, insisting that international law was “not a suicide pact”. If a state cannot defend itself “or is criticised for doing so in line with international law, inevitably terrorist organisations will become more and more emboldened,” Israeli ambassador Meirav Eilon Shahar told the gathering. “There is no moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas. We will not let Israel be delegitimised by misrepresentation of reality,” she said. Palestinian ambassador Ibrahim Khraishi flatly rejected that view. “You should wake up in this room. This is a massacre, this is genocide,” he said, accusing Israel of acting “above the law”. “The problem didn’t start on October 7 — It started 75 years ago,” he said. He received support from other countries, including from Jordan’s representative who insisted that “Israel must halt its aggression”. - with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Ominous pink bag discovered in Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/raise-your-hands-israel-raids-hospital-in-centre-of-gaza-war/news-story/d2f2ea61d6339efc073b19f0dc462018,"An ominous pink bag found in a “secluded” section of Gaza’s largest hospital is proof Hamas soldiers were hiding inside, Israel claims. Israeli forces stormed the Al-Shifa hospital in a major pre-dawn raid Wednesday, claiming to have found military equipment including weapons. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza has denied the claims, saying Israeli forces “did not find any equipment or weapons in the hospital”. A journalist at the site told AFP they carried out room-by-room searches after days of fighting on the outskirts of the facility with Hamas militants. In a seven-minute video posted to X on Thursday, Lt. Colonel Jonathan Conricus from Israeli Defence Force (IDF) toured the hospital, showing what he claimed to be evidence of Hamas’ use of hospitals in their military operation. “What we have found, I think, is only the tip of the iceberg,” he said. During the “one shot” video, Lt. Conricus showed guns, ammunition, grenades and miliary equipment which had been left in the MRI department of the hospital. In one section of the hospital, Lt. Conricus revealed a pink “grab bag” that was left on top of a “spare part”. He claimed the bag, which had been emptied by the IDF, contained “a full military kit for one Hamas terrorist”. After holding up the empty bag, the camera panned to its laid-out contents, which included a grenade, fighting vest, ammunition, boots, uniforms and an AK-47 gun. “In the hospital, we found weapons, intelligence materials, and military technology and equipment,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters. “We also found an operational headquarters with comms equipment … belonging to Hamas” and “Hamas uniforms”, he said. The army earlier published images of what it said were guns, grenades and other equipment found at the hospital. AFP was unable to independently verify the images. Rear Admiral Hargari said troops found Hamas uniforms “that were thrown on the hospital floor so that the terrorists could escape in civilian guise.” “These findings unequivocally prove that the hospital was used for terror, in complete violation of international law,” he said. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has repeatedly denied claims the hospital was doubling up as a command centre for the terrorist group. “Essentially we don’t allow” weapons in any hospital, said health ministry director Munir al-Bursh in a statement. The ministry said Israeli soldiers destroyed medical equipment which is not available elsewhere in Gaza and detained two engineers who worked on the hospital’s oxygen and power supplies. The United Nations estimates there are at least 2,300 patients, staff and displaced Palestinians inside Al-Shifa. Global agencies including the World Health Organization and the International Committee of the Red Cross raised concerns for the safety of patients and medical staff following the Israeli raid. Hours after Israeli troops launched a night-time raid on the hospital, soldiers interrogated patients in the compound’s courtyard while other Palestinians stood stripped to their underwear. “All men 16 years and above, raise your hands,” a soldier shouted in accented Arabic through a loudspeaker at those sheltering inside Al-Shifa hospital, which has been at the centre of fierce urban combat for days. “Exit the building towards the courtyard and surrender,” the soldier ordered, according to a journalist who visited the embattled hospital several days ago for interviews and was trapped inside because of the fighting outside. About 1000 male Palestinians, their hands above their heads, were soon led into the vast hospital courtyard, some of them stripped naked by Israeli soldiers checking them for weapons or explosives, the journalist told AFP. Hours later, some 200 remained in their underwear, forced to stand beside tanks used in the military incursion into the medical facility. The army labelled the raid a “precise and targeted” operation against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that launched the deadly October 7 attacks on southern Israel. Israel withdrew its troops and vehicles on Wednesday evening, the journalist told AFP, repositioning them outside the hospital walls. “Before entering the hospital, our forces encountered explosive devices and terrorist squads, and fighting commenced in which terrorists were killed,” the military said of the battle preceding the raid. Witnesses have described conditions inside the hospital as horrific, with medical procedures performed without anaesthetic, families with scant food or water living in corridors, and the stench of decomposing corpses filling the air. As Israeli forces raced through the corridors, hundreds of young men emerged from different wards, including the maternity section, which was hit in a strike a few days ago, the journalist reported. Soldiers fired warning shots as they moved from room to room looking for Hamas militants, he said, adding the troops were also searching women and children, some of whom were in tears. Tanks in hospital complex Hamas in its October 7 attack, the worst in Israel’s history, killed about 1200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 240 hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli officials. In Gaza, more than 11,300 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground invasion since, health officials in the Hamas-run territory have said. In the hospital incursion, the journalist said Israeli troops entered the main emergency department and other wards. The Israeli army, in a statement early Wednesday, said they were targeting Hamas “in a specified area” of the facility. Soldiers were still questioning wounded people and their companions on Wednesday afternoon, as they moved between hospital departments, the journalist at Al-Shifa said. The army said it had delivered incubators, baby food and medical supplies to the hospital, which AFP was not able to verify. The journalist said soldiers were handing out drinking water to some of the displaced people who had taken shelter at the hospital during weeks of warfare. “Our medical teams and Arabic speaking soldiers are on the ground to ensure that these supplies reach those in need,” the army said. Gaza’s Hamas government accused the Israeli army of committing a “war crime and crime against humanity”. Over the past few days Israel has encircled Al-Shifa in north Gaza, charging that tunnels under the facility were being used as hideouts by Hamas commanders. The White House said that US intelligence sources corroborated Israel’s claim that Hamas and another militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, had buried an operational “command and control node” under Al-Shifa. Hamas has denied those charges and stressed the suffering inside the besieged facility that, like other hospitals, has been without electricity or fuel for generators amid the Israeli siege of the Palestinian territory. The United Nations said earlier that at least 2,300 people — patients, staff and displaced civilians — were inside and may be unable to escape because of the fierce fighting. Citing the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, UN humanitarian agency OCHA said 40 patients had died in Al-Shifa on Tuesday. The hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya said that 179 bodies had been buried in a mass grave inside the complex. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Dutton explodes over Albo’s overseas trip,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/politics/cyber-attacks-are-on-the-rise-in-australia-according-to-bombshell-new-report/news-story/1e8f9487fc9c62c54f93983bbc4f7305,"Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has exploded over the Prime Minister’s trip to the United States and questioned his leadership over the rise of anti-Semitism in Australia. In a wide-ranging speech during question time, Mr Dutton asked the house to express its concern about the rise of anti-Semitism and social disharmony, to condemn the Prime Minister’s lack of “strong leadership”. “Prime Minister, I have written to you and what you should do is consult with the premiers and the chief ministers and immediately convene a meeting of the national cabinet to get a better understanding of the police response, to understand what the security and intelligence agencies are providing, to collate that information, and to have a coherent response which provides support and underpinning a security for people of Jewish faith in this country when they need it most – in their hour of need,” he said. “This Prime Minister has gone missing.” Mr Dutton said since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the Albanese government had failed to stand up for the Jewish community and was “speaking out both sides of its mouth”. “The Australian public sees this as a government where the wheels are quickly falling off,” Mr Dutton said. “It’s given rise to social disharmony in this country. There are Jewish kids who are afraid to go to school.” Mr Albanese said government’s words “have been qualified, the message divided”. But straight after question time, the Prime Minister left for his trip to San Francisco for the APEC summit. “Australia’s participation at the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting signals our enduring commitment to strengthening regional economic cooperation and growth,” he said ahead of the trip. “This year’s theme focuses on resiliency, sustainability and inclusion – all key priorities of the Australian government. “Engagement with APEC partners is critical for seizing the opportunities to create the jobs of the future, to expand our economic growth, and to take advantage of our location – on the doorstep of the fastest growing region in human history.” Albanese slams Dutton over QT comments Mr Albanese slammed Mr Dutton for the “weaponisation of anti-Semitism” in parliament. Mr Albanese said it was “frankly beyond contempt” that Mr Dutton would seek to link anti-Semitism with the decision of the High Court. The Prime Minister said he would continue to stand up against anti-Semitism, and he remains “proud” of his track record of advocating for a two-state solution. “I make no apologies for trying to bring communities together, not divide them. Because that’s the role of political leaders,” he said. “At a time where there is social division, leaders have a choice – to either bring people together or divide them.” Mr Albanese said Mr Dutton had been “exposed for all to see” for going so low as to link the two issues. Mr Albanese said he understood how fearful Jewish Australians and Arab-Australians and Islamic Australians all were at the moment, and said “no one should threaten people because of their religion or their race”. Mr Albanese went on to offer some of his strongest language yet on the unfolding crisis in the Middle East. “We have responsibilities as a democratic nation to say that democratic nations must stand up, consistent with the international rule of law,” Mr Albanese said. “That is something that I have done and will consistently do.” Later on Wednesday, Wentworth MP Allegra Spender also denounced Mr Dutton for “turning antisemitism into a political football” saying it was damaging not only for the Jewish community but for national cohesion. “To watch the Opposition deliberately try and politicise this issue and conflate it with the Prime Minister’s travel schedule in order to score political points is disgraceful,” she sad in a statement after question time. “We need to come together as a country and take urgent action against anti-Semitism and all forms of hate speech. “This is a time when Australia’s national unity has never been more important. Peter Dutton’s attempt to weaponise and politicise anti-Semitism for political gain is unconscionable.” Dutton raises questions over ‘hard-core’ criminals Mr Dutton then moved to ask the house to express its concerns about threats to community safety in the wake of last week’s High Court decision, and the presence of “hard core criminals” including murderers, rapists, and paedophiles among that cohort. He called on Mr Albanese to “cancel his plans to travel to the United States”, because his priority “must be the protection of the Australian community at home”. He doubled down his calls for Mr Albanese to urgently convene a national cabinet meeting to “formulate a strong and coherent response to combat the rise of anti-Semitism, repair social cohesion, and protect community safety”. Mr Dutton said the government should urgently bring forward any legislation necessary to “neutralise the threat posed by the hard core criminals his government has released into the Australian community”. He said the parliament should sit for as long as is necessary until that legislation is dealt with. The government is adamant every one of the asylum seekers and refugees released from indefinite detention after last week’s High Court decision is on an appropriate visa with conditions. Immigration Minister Andrew Giles faced questioning from Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and Dan Tehan in question time on Wednesday. It followed reports from the ABC that revealed some of the detainees released in recent days were in the community without visas. Mr Giles said there were now 83 people who had been released from detention after the decision, and reiterated that it was not the federal government’s desire to have them in the community. “Complying with the orders of the court is not optional,” he said. “We have to give effect to the decision that was made and all of those 83 releases required by the decision of the court are people who are on bridging visas, with appropriate conditions.” Government signals new legislation following High Court ruling Senator Wong has confirmed emergency legislation will be introduced to respond to the High Court ruling that indefinite detention is unlawful. “The government is working through that and, as I said, the government intends to introduce legislation shortly to further respond to the decision of the High Court and we look forward to the opposition assisting with passage of that legislation as soon as possible,” she said. Wong fires up over the Greens questioning A fired up Penny Wong unleashed on a Greens senator for seeking answers about Australia’s defence exports to Israel. David Shoebridge asked the Foreign Minister during question time on Wednesday whether Australia was supplying parts for F-35 fighter jets, or other weapons, to the Jewish state. Senator Wong insisted the government had not supplied weapons to Israel since the conflict with Hamas began. But after a clash between the two, the Foreign Minister lost her cool, drawing a line between the questioning and misinformation on social media. “You are trying to make this a political issue,” she shouted, pointing her finger at the Greens. “It is utterly irresponsible” On Tuesday, Mr Albanese told Labor MPs social media posts that suggested Australia was supplying weapons to Israel was not true. Australia’s cyber boss ‘recalled’ to defence The senior Australian Air Force officer recently appointed to the country’s top cybersecurity role has been recalled to defence to deal with a “workplace matter”. In a statement, the Australian Defence Force said Air Marshal Darren Goldie, who was appointed the inaugural national cyber security co-ordinator in July, had “been recalled to defence to deal with a workplace matter related to his time in defence”. “He is currently on leave. While the matter is under consideration it would be inappropriate to comment further,” the statement said. “The welfare of our people remains our priority and it is requested that Air Marshal Goldie’s privacy is respected at this time.” Home Affairs and Cyber Security Minister Clare O’Neil said she had been notified of Air Marshal Goldie’s recall. She said Department of Home Affairs deputy secretary of cyber and infrastructure security Hamish Hansford would act as national cyber security co-ordinator in the interim. Air Marshal Goldie had, in recent weeks, taken the lead on the country’s cybersecurity responses to Optus’s nationwide shutdown and the DP World cyber attack that forced ports across Australia to close. Dutton’s national cabinet call for Albo Peter Dutton has called on Anthony Albanese to urgently convene a national cabinet meeting to deal with the ongoing domestic implications of the Israel-Hamas war. The Opposition Leader told reporters on Wednesday that he wrote to the Prime Minister to voice his concerns about rising anti-Semitism across Australia. Mr Dutton said Mr Albanese and state and territory leaders should urgently meet to discuss their joint response to increased reports of anti-social behaviour. “I fear that there will be a significant act within our community that will cause harm to people in the Jewish community, or the community (more broadly),” the Liberal leader said. “At a time when temperatures are rising, the Prime Minister should be showing strong leadership to lower those temperatures. He has completely failed that test.” Mr Dutton said it was time for the government to “show resolve” and speak with “one united voice against anti-Semitism”. “That’s the view of not just the Opposition but of many Jewish leaders within this community.” Albanese ‘shouldn’t leave country’ Mr Dutton said Mr Albanese “should not go to APEC” to deal with the fallout of the High Court’s decision last week that indefinite immigration detention is illegal. About 80 people have been freed since last week’s ruling, including some people known to be convicted criminals. Mr Dutton and the Coalition have slammed the government for failing to plan for the outcome and now want legislation to be rushed through the parliament to deal with the decision. Mr Albanese will head to San Francisco on Wednesday afternoon for the economic forum, meaning he will miss the last sitting day of the week. Mr Dutton said he shouldn’t go and parliament “should not rise” until the government comes forward with legislation “We will sit down with the government, we will sit additional hours through the night, whatever it takes to get these people back into custody, which is where they belong,” Mr Dutton said. “It is the No. 1 priority of any government to keep the community safe. The government is failing, (Mr Albanese) has been asleep at the wheel and continues to be asleep at the wheel on this issue.” Ahead of question time on Thursday, Greens Senator Nick McKim urged Labor to not let any legislative fix be “dictated” by Mr Dutton because he had a “horrendous record of cruelty to refugees and disregarding basic human rights.” Silence over Gaza The Greens will ask the Senate to hold a minute’s silence after proceedings on Wednesday afternoon in respect to civilian lives lost in Gaza. It follows weeks of political divisions over the government’s response to the conflict. Greens foreign affairs spokesman Jordon Steele-John said all major parties should join the minor party to call for a ceasefire. “Children and families have faced horrific death, injury and suffering. People in Gaza are experiencing relentless bombing. Those that survive the bombing have increasingly limited access to electricity, food or water,” he said in a statement. “This cannot go on.” The Albanese government has stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, with Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong saying on Sunday, “We all want to take the next steps towards a ceasefire.” Earlier this morning, The Israeli Defence Forces posted on X that it was “carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital” after it accused the terrorist group of having a command post under the complex. Thousands of civilians, including 600 patients, are reportedly sheltering at the hospital according to reports from British broadcaster Channel 4. High Court move unleashes concern Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said the federal government was “deeply concerned” over the release of individuals convicted of murder and child sexual abuse into the community. Mr Marles said the government was doing everything in its power to closely monitor individuals who have been deemed as dangerous and flagged that a full briefing on the decision had yet to be released by the top court. “Obviously, we were in the High Court arguing against this decision so we are deeply concerned about the consequences of it which is why we’ve put those people who have been released on bridging visas which contain the strongest possible conditions on them, and we are now looking at every options available to around what more we can do, but bear in mind the full judgment hasn’t been released yet,” Mr Marles told Sky. “We want to make sure the steps we take are legally robust.” Major cyber warning China has been named the main actor of state-sponsored cyber attacks against Australia amid warnings of a nationwide surge in cybercrime. An annual cyber threat report released on Tuesday revealed 94,000 cyber incidents had been reported over the past financial year, with the cost of attacks on small businesses rising on average to $46,000. The report flagged that attacks on federal government agencies and critical infrastructure have also increased, with state-sponsored cyber hacks pinned as a serious concern. Chinese state-backed hackers were identified as a leading culprit of cyber warfare, alongside Russia and Iran. Foreign cyber actors are increasingly crippling local businesses, the report said, with the most common form of attack being “compromised emails” where a scammer uses email to trick someone into sending money or divulging confidential company information. Individuals are the most vulnerable to identify fraud, online banking fraud, and online shopping fraud. Mr Marles said cyber warfare was a critical issue raised with during recent conversations with China. “We are making sure we have the best possible defence in place and there’s a range of other state actors who have been engaged in this as well,” he said. Christmas trade relief on the cards China’s trade block on Australian, beef, lobster and wine could be lifted by Christmas according to the trade minister. Don Farrell spoke ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Wentao on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in San Francisco. “Issues in respect to lobster and to beef are biosecurity issues, but I remain very confident based on my meeting last week, and hopefully my meeting today, that by Christmas all of these trade impediments will be removed,” Mr Farrell told ABC RN. China imposed sanctions worth $20bn on Australian products during the height of diplomatic tensions in 2020. Only $2bn worth of sanctions remain on Australian exports, including rock lobsters and beef. “China has its processes to go through and we understand that – we are simply encouraging them to complete those processes.” Government must ‘wake up’ on toxic dust Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie wants to know if the federal government will wait and hold a sausage sizzle before it bans the import and manufacture of a toxic concrete linked to incurable lung disease. The government is under pressure to ban engineered stone, which is linked to silicosis, after major retailers phased out a range of products in response to a damning safety report. Swedish furniture giant Ikea announced it would follow in Bunnings’ footsteps to phase out range of trendy kitchen benchtops from its shelves in the wake of a Safe Work Australia report that recommended an outright ban on the material to protect another generation of workers from fatal illness. Independent crossbenchers and MPs penned an open letter to state and federal workplace ministers on Wednesday urging for a nationwide ban on the material. “It’s really embarrassing when you have Bunnings that’s already come over the top of you. Wake up and do something that is sensible that saves lives in this country and do it before Christmas,” Senator Lambie told reporters.

Cops probe confronting scene at MP offices,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/propalestine-protesters-leave-fake-bodies-outside-politicians-offices-across-melbourne/news-story/a241cfeb94a5f945c7bd38c190ce364c,"Police are investigating after fake bodies wrapped in bloodied white bags were left outside politicians offices across Melbourne as a part of pro-Palestine protests. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, NDIS Minister Bill Shorten, and a number of other federal MPs including Ged Kearney and Andrew Giles were targeted by the protests. Child-sized dolls were also seen covered in red paint on the sidewalk, with up to 14 of effigies left at each office. The fake bodies were accompanied by several signs that read “Free Palestine”, “End the occupation” and “No more bodies in Gaza”. Police have confirmed to NCA Newswire that they are investigating, with effigies left in Moonee Ponds, Heidelberg, Geelong, Preston, Thomastown and Coburg. “Anyone who witnessed the incidents, has dashcam/CCTV footage or information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000,” a Victoria Police spokesperson said. Protest group No More Bodies in Gaza claimed responsibility for the act, taking to Instagram to condemn Labor MPs who they say are remaining silent “in the face of the mounting atrocities” despite expressing support for Palestine in the past. “The bodies we have laid at the offices of the parliamentarians are equal to the number of Palestinian deaths per hour in Gaza,” the group wrote on social media. “These deaths are not just numbers – these were living, breathing human beings with families and aspirations, who were murdered by the genocidal settler project of Israel. “A ceasefire alone will not end the occupation, and without an end, the cycle of violence will continue as it has done for the last 75 years.” Its understood that police officers have now removed the bodies from outside the offices. NCA Newswire has contacted Victoria Police for comment. Some of those who saw the fake bodies before they were taken away described it as horrifying. “I can’t tell you how horrified I was...its concerning because small children are going to see that, teenagers are going to see that,” a witness told 3AW. “Even I as a 53-year-old found it disgusting and confronting.” Anti-Defamation Commission chair, Dvir Abramovich feared the incident would “only increase tensions. “Something very wrong is happening in country,” said Dr Abramovich. “I am very worried that this tsunami of extremism and street warfare, that will shock the conscience of every Australian, will end in tragedy.” No More Bodies in Gaza has vowed to continue its protest actions and rallies along with a letter writing and phone call campaign until the federal government responds to their requests. Tensions are high in Australia as Israel continues to bombard Gaza in response to a Hamas terror attack on October 7 which killed 1200 Israelis. The bombings in Gaza have killed more than 10,000, the majority of whom are children. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Israel storms Gaza’s largest hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israeli-defence-force-begins-military-operation-against-gazas-largest-hospital-satellite-pics-show-tanks-amassed-outside/news-story/58613a81a262b1daf5d793b490cfce0d,"Israeli tanks are poised outside Gaza’s largest hospital with reports the military has already entered some buildings. Satellite photos taken in the past few hours reveal the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) has amassed a formation of tanks and armoured vehicles around the perimeter of Dar Al-Shifa Hospital, which is the largest medical complex and emergency hospital in the Gaza Strip. Israel claims the hospital is also the command post for the Palestinian Hamas’ terrorist wing, hidden underground beneath thousands of ailing and sheltering civilians. Further assemblies of tanks and armour can be seen within rubble fortifications bulldozed into the suburbs a few hundred metres from the hospital. The director of the Al Shifa Hospital has told Palestinian media that his staff and patients are attempting to shelter in hallways with the sound of heavy gunfire coming from the streets outside. Palestinian health minister Mai Al-Kaila accused Israel of committing “crimes against humanity” at the hospital. Reports from inside say staff and patients have been told to take cover and stay away from windows, while medical procedures are taking place without anaesthetic. “There are bodies littered in the hospital complex and there is no longer electricity at the morgues,” said hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya. “We were forced to bury them in a mass grave,” he added, estimating that 179 bodies had been interred so far, including seven newborns who died when their incubators lost power. After warnings from the United States and others that the Al-Shifa hospital must be protected, the IDF said in the early hours that they had entered the compound in Gaza City. “Based on intelligence information and an operational necessity, IDF forces are carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital,” the military said in a statement. The United Nations estimates that at least 2,300 patients, staff and displaced civilians are inside the facility, trapped by days of fierce fighting and aerial bombardments. Ongoing attempts to evacuate the hospital have been abandoned amid heavy fighting in the surrounding suburbs. “The occupation (IDF) officially informed us of its intention to storm the Shifa complex in the coming minutes,” a Ministry of Health in Gaza statement adds. Subsequent reports say tanks have since forced their way through to the hospital’s main courtyard - where many refugees are camped - as commandos stormed the hospital from multiple directions. Israel’s ultimatum A spokesman for the Israeli government confirmed it had made an ultimatum. “The IDF calls on Hamas terrorists hiding under Shifa Hospital to surrender,” says Eylon Levy. “We have given enough warning. Its protected status under international law has lapsed, and we are fully within our rights to counter Hamas’ belligerent military activities.” The military says its attack complies with the laws of war. “That’s what we’re doing by sending our forces in with specially trained medical teams and Arabic speakers, after trying to facilitate an evacuation for A MONTH and giving Hamas time to surrender. We know what our obligations are. We know our rights.” In a later statement on X, Mr Levy said the IDF would “destroy all of Hamas’ terror and governing infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.” “Our duty of self defense means eliminating the terror group that did that, so that it can never perpetrate the same atrocities again.” Israel’s surgical strikes The hospital has been under siege for four days, with no electricity or water supplies getting through to its patients. Its last stocks of medical supplies reportedly ran out after attempts to deliver fresh supplies were halted due to the bombing of an ambulance convoy. The US Pentagon came out overnight supporting Israel’s allegations. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told media that “a variety of intelligence sourcing” had confirmed “Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad used some hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them, to conceal and support their military operations and to hold hostages.” He called such use of hospitals “a war crime.” “If true, this would endanger civilians and violate the laws of war,” Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “It would not, however, give the Israeli military free rein to do anything it wanted against the hospital.” Israel has been calling for Gaza City hospitals to shut down and evacuate for several weeks. But the bombing of ambulances and medical convoys, along with ongoing fighting in the streets, has led many medical personnel to refuse to do so. The IDF has denied being responsible for a series of projectile hits on the hospital in recent days. But the heavy use of tank artillery and large but low precision 500kg and 1-tonne bombs has significantly increased the risk of “collateral damage” in built-up areas. Appeal for sanctuary The outcome of the battle for Dar Al-Shifa Hospital will be crucial in the campaign against Hamas terrorists, but also for Israel’s standing as a participant in a rules-based world order. The Geneva Conventions, created after the horrors of World War II, the Nazi Holocaust and Imperial Japan’s brutality against military and civilians alike, established hospitals as sanctuaries of the highest order. And that the safety of patients over-rules all other considerations. Israel committed its professional fighting force, the IDF, to the authority of the Geneva Conventions in 1951, after the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. Hamas militants are members of a proscribed terrorist organisation because it has been found to deliberately target civilians to reach its political and military objectives. “We do not want to see a firefight in a hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people are simply trying to get the medical care that they deserve,” Kirby said after supporting Israel’s allegations. “As we have been clear on multiple occasions, Hamas’s actions do not lessen Israel’s responsibilities to protect civilians in Gaza.” The WHO’s Ghebreyesus said in a statement that his organisation had managed to contact health practitioners in the facility yesterday. “Regrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore,” he said. He claimed hospitals can be assaulted if they are demonstrably being used to “commit acts harmful to the enemy”. But, even then, only the highest standards - similar to those aimed at preventing police from shooting hostages to kill a hostage-taker - must be enforced. Laws of war Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) analyst Nathan Ruser says it is the role of professional armies to “take on risk to protect civilians”. “It’s abundantly clear that to the IDF, there’s no civilian price too high to pay for anything that even slightly reduces risk for any IDF soldier,” he tweeted this morning. “This is inherently a massive problem and is leading to immeasurable civilian suffering and death.” WHO’s Ghebreyesus stresses the importance of a “clear warning” before a major attack. “Such warnings should be clear and cannot be issued for the purpose of disrupting the functioning of the hospital or forcing an evacuation.” “There is no reliably safe route to evacuate,” says Ghebreyesus. “Satellite imagery confirms fires, military operations, and roadblocks on every conceivable route. And many sick and injured people in the hospital wouldn’t be able to evacuate even if the roads were clear.” And he says Hamas’ illegal behaviour does not entitle Israel to the same behaviour. “The most critical legal point right now: people unable to leave the hospital still have protections under the laws of war against indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks.” Ruser says the Hamas terrorist group has undeniably built up an infrastructure network exploiting Gazan civilians as human shields. And this is a clear war crime. “That makes any operation into Gaza inherently challenging,” he adds, “but the approach of utterly disregarding civilian collateral damage in Gaza by the IDF is absolutely condemnable.” But Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu says it’s not his fault. “It is Hamas not Israel that should be held accountable for committing a double war crime - targeting civilians while hiding behind civilians,” he said in a statement released about 11am AEDT. “The forces of civilization must back Israel in defeating Hamas barbarism.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Rival caught up in jumping castle furore,https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/jumping-castle-business-slammed-as-antisemitic-after-refusing-jewish-schools-request/news-story/f4175d99e6bd16b6b1651acfd373356b,"A Sydney jumping castle business could face legal action over their public rejection of a request from a Jewish school, with the company owner saying she wouldn’t accept “blood money”. Police officers visited Masada College in St Ives on Wednesday morning as news broke that the school had been blasted on social media by the owner of Western Sydney Jump. She took to the business’s Instagram page on Tuesday to share her response to a request from the school to rent outdoor games for a school function this Friday. “There is no way I am taking a Zionist booking,” the company replied to the Masada principal’s email. “I don’t want your blood money. Free Palestine.” NSW Police told NCA NewsWire that while no official complaint had been made over the incident, officers were attending the St Ives school to conduct inquiries. After her initial post, the owner asserted her “right to decline any booking” before issuing a long post on the conflict in Gaza. “Just to be clear, this is about Zionists. Not Jews. I have zero issue with the Jewish community,” she continued. “You know what actually blows my mind … when Palestinians chant ‘From the river to the sea. Palestine will be free!’ you find Zionists crying and saying ‘Look, they want us all dead’. “But when Zionists actually say ‘flatten Gaza’, or ‘give them hell’, or ‘there should be no limit to the number of civilian casualties in Palestine’, they say nothing. “Like one side is ACTUALLY asking for a genocide with words that describe genocide. And the other is asking for freedom and somehow they put those asking for freedom at fault.” Western Sydney Jump has removed its Instagram page in the fallout from the incident. The controversy has also resulted in a rival company operating under the name Jumping Castles Western Sydney to be misidentified and abused on social media. On Tuesday afternoon, the owner, Rebecca, shared a statement stating her business supported “all cultures to love one another”. “Unfortunately, we have been defamed, abused, threatened by the actions of another company’s actions,” she said. “Our family business does not condone discrimination nor do we agree with what has occurred.” The response from Western Sydney Jump has been met with fury by Jewish groups and prominent Australians, with NSW Premier Chris Minns slamming the business owner. “This is outrageous. It’s not in keeping with any part of our multicultural community. I condemn it completely,” Mr Minns said. The conflict was described as “indicative of the surge in anti-Semitism” in Australia, according to Executive Council of Australian Jewry chief executive Alex Ryvchin. “To refuse to hire a jumping castle to kids who happen to be Jewish is the height of prejudice and low bigotry. The business should be ashamed,” he said. “The reference to blood money of course invokes the blood libel, a classic anti-Jewish myth. “The openness of the racism shows how normalised anti-Jewish hate is becoming.” NSW Health Minister Ryan Park said the messages were “appalling, despicable and disgraceful”. “I can’t condemn them any more than that. They have no place in a modern Australia,” he said. “I find those comments, not only offensive, but highly racist. They should be called out for what they are.” He also called on the sender to apologise, and said it was the “last thing” needed in the community, “particularly given the challenges we see overseas every day”. A finance expert has urged Australians to be prepared for interest rates to rise again in the near future, as the country battles a worsening cost of living crisis. A small fashion brand has hit out at an Aussie giant, accusing it of copying their designs – the same week its founders bought a fourth multimillion-dollar property. Angry customers have hit out at ANZ, accusing the bank of deliberately making it difficult for them to access their own money and “interrogating” them about why they want it.",
Secret Hamas lair found under hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-claims-to-have-uncovered-secret-hamas-lair-underneath-childrens-hospital/news-story/8db4abbcc6b0e99f659a44dbb5ec7227,"The Israeli military claims to have discovered a Hamas lair in the basement of a children’s hospital in the Gaza Strip. In video footage posted by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on social media, spokesman Daniel Hagari uncovers an underground tunnel, located outside a building he identifies as the house of a Hamas militant. The tunnel leads underneath the nearby al-Rentisi hospital. As the video continues, Admiral Hagari explores the basement of the hospital, and highlights a room full of military gear. “I want to show you a room where we found all the gear, the operational gear of Hamas,” Admiral Hagari says. “Look at what Hamas is holding inside the hospital.” “I want you to understand: this kind of gear is the gear for a major fight. These are explosives. These are vests with explosives. It’s a body vest for terrorists to explode on forces, among hospitals, among patients,” says Admiral Hagari. “We have hand grenades, Kalashnikovs (assault rifles), and then we have the RPGs. People shooting RPGs from hospitals. This is Hamas, firing RPGs from hospitals. The world has to understand who Israel is fighting against.” The video then proceeds deeper into the basement of the hospital, where Admiral Hagari says Israeli forces found a motorcycle used in the attack on October 7. “They came back from the massacre on the seventh of October, into al-Rentisi hospital, with hostages on a motorcycle,” he said. “This is a suspicion for an area where hostages were being held.” The area in the footage also includes a chair with a rope next to it. A baby’s bottle is visible on top of an electricity breaker, labelled with the words “World Health Organisation”. There is also a bathroom, which Admiral Hagari again cites as proof that hostages were kept there. “You don’t need to build, improvisedly, in a hospital in the basement, unless you want to hold someone there and you don’t want anyone to see,” he says. Fighting continued to rage in Gaza on Tuesday, local time, more than five weeks after Hamas’s shock October 7 attack sparked a furious response from Israel, which has vowed to destroy the Palestinian militant group. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Israel and around 240 hostages taken, according to Israeli officials. In Gaza, more than 11,200 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed, according to the healthy ministry, which is under Hamas’s control. At least 179 people, including babies and patients who died in the intensive care unit, were buried in a “mass grave” at Gaza’s biggest hospital, said director Mohammad Abu Salmiya. Seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those buried after hospital fuel supplies ran out at the compound, which is caught in intense fighting between Israel and Hamas. Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as hideouts, a charge the militant group has denied and AFP cannot independently verify – the video mentioned above is among the evidence Israel has cited. US President Joe Biden urged Israel on Monday to protect Gaza’s main hospital as heavy fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas raged around the complex. “It’s my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital,” Mr Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if he had expressed concerns to Israel on the issue. “The hospital must be protected.” Israel was facing mounting international pressure over the human cost of its war with Gaza’s Hamas rulers but was working to expand its “window of legitimacy”, its top diplomat said Monday. “We have two or three weeks until international pressure really steps up but the foreign ministry is working to broaden the window of legitimacy, and the fighting will carry on for as long as necessary,” Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said, as quoted by his spokesman. As Israel’s ground campaign advanced, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas had “lost control” of Gaza. “Terrorists are fleeing southward. Civilians are looting Hamas bases,” he said on Israeli television, without providing evidence for the claim. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned on Monday its Gaza operations might shut down due to fuel shortages. “The humanitarian operation in Gaza will grind to a halt in the next 48 hours as no fuel is allowed to enter,” UNRWA’s Gaza chief Thomas White wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Gaza has been under near-total Israeli siege and is short of food, fuel and other basic supplies. – with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

‘Deep breaths’: Warning ahead of Q+A,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/abc-cancels-live-studio-audience-for-discussion-on-israel-conflict/news-story/2caa3b51267ff79c115bb34f728afb58,"The ABC made the decision to not allow a live studio audience for Monday night’s Q+A program, as panellists engaged in tense discussions over the escalating Israeli-Hamas war. Host Patricia Karvelas made the announcement at the beginning of the episode, acknowledging the “difficult and sensitive discussion” about to take place by the panel. It is the first time a live audience has been cancelled after in-person participation was waved during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. However the program’s track record for controversy when it comes to global conflict discussion may have factored into the cancellation. Last year, a Russian-Australian university student was ejected from the audience after professing his support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Stan Grant kicked out Sasha Gilles-Lekakis after he went off script from his proposed question, and accused the Ukrainian Government of collaborating with “Nazi groups (besieging) Russian populations in the Donbas, killing an estimated 13,000 people”. However the most notable scandal came years earlier in 2010 when former prime minister John Howard had a pair of shoes thrown at him over his response to the Iraq War. The shoe-thrower, environmental activist Peter Grey, was kicked out of the live audience and became the subject of widespread criticism from both sides of government. He died only six months later from cancer and had his shoes famously auctioned off for charity, with the $3560 winning bid going towards Red Cross initiatives in Iraq. Concerns for this week’s Monday night program led to a“very significant police contingent” being stationed outside the ABC Melbourne studio. “We believe in your right to ask questions and that is a right we will always defend. Tonight our panellists will hear your questions through video link as we explore an issue rocking our diaspora Jewish and Arab communities,” she said. “We will conduct a robust, healthy and respectful debate.” At one stage, the debate became extremely tense, with Karvelas calling for calm. “Deep breaths, deep breaths and I hope the country is having one, too,” she said. The panel included Assistant Foreign Affairs Minister Tim Watts, former Australian ambassador to Israel and Dave Sharma, Australia Palestine Advocacy Network head Nasser Mashni, lawyer and national chair of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council Mark Leibler, and United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese. The discussion was largely civil, but became tense on several occasions as Mr Leibler and Mr Mashni clashed over points including protests being held in Australia. Protest chant dubbed ‘racist comment’ The panel was also asked if the popular chant heard at pro-Palestine rallies: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” actually called to “eradicate Israel”. Mr Leibler said the saying was a “racist comment,” and implied there was “no room for a state of Israel”. He accused pro-Palestine protests of celebrating violence, however his comments were immediately criticised by Mr Mashni and Ms Albanese. “This is not something in line with Jewish tradition. What do the Palestinians do? Whether it’s 9/11 or October 7, they hand out lollies and they celebrate when people are hacked to death. I don’t know. It is a fact. It is reality,” he said. Mr Mashni said Mr Leibler was “besmirching our entire people”. “We are killed, we’re blamed, we’re smeared,” he said. “What we have is 75 years of oppression, 75 years of denial. Palestinians are human beings, too. We have rights like everybody else to live in peace and sanctity.” Ms Albanese said Mr Mashni’s comments were “inappropriate and disrespectful”. “Speaking of what Hamas has done – war crimes … I’ve condemned that as such,” he said. “When it comes to the killing of Palestinians … these are war crimes and to an extent under international law, this may amount to crimes against humanity because so is the intentional starvation and intentional extermination.” Monday night’s discussion comes as Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong has faced criticism after she called on Israel to “comply and observe international humanitarian law,” in regards to the government’s attack on civilians in the Gaza Strip. “We know Hamas is a terrorist organisation. It has demonstrated it has no respect for international law, but Australia is a democracy and so too is Israel, and the standards that we seek and accept are higher,” she said on ABC’s Insiders on Sunday. Mr Watts said while a “call for humanitarian pause is the necessary first step,” much more needed to be done. “What we’ve said is there needs to be release of hostages. Hamas needs to stop its rocket attacks on Israel,” he said. “It needs to stop using civilians in Gaza as human shields and for a durable peace in the region, we need to dismantle Hamas.” Mr Sharma, who was also the former MP for the federal seat of Wentworth, which has a large Jewish population, said Hamas needed to be “ousted from political power”. “War is a terrible thing, but we have to remember how this began which is the October 7th terrorist attacks,” he said. “Hamas climbed in through the fence, slaughtered children in their holes. Killed parents in front of their children, raped, abducted, murdered, defiled any number of people. “You leave them there, there will be further bloodshed, further loss of life and further conflict.” Mr Sharma also said political leaders and law enforcement needed to do more to “call out” anti-Semitic behaviour. He said religious services at synagogues have been interrupted, with Jewish-owned businesses boycotted and defaced since the October 7 attack. “That is not acceptable in Australia. Doesn’t matter what your feelings are on in conflict, that is absolutely not acceptable,” Mr Sharma said. When asked by Karvelas who was failing, he named Senator Wong and criticised her response to the pro-Palestinian protest in the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield, which has a high Jewish population. Mr Watts defended Senator Wong’s response, which included tweeting that the violence was unacceptable. “(She) said it was good that they (the protesters) had apologised. Well, yes, it was good … but it shouldn’t have happened,” he said. “When the line is crossed here, it’s not: There’s a fault on all sides here. We need to call out the party that is crossing that line.” Mr Watts disagreed with the criticism. “There are few people in this country having a longer record than fighting prejudice in this country than Penny Wong,” he said. “Penny Wong absolutely condemned anti-Semitism during. Anyone who seeks to undermine her credibility on this issue frankly is seeking to confect difference over this issue.” Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered opposite the synagogue during a Shabbat service after Burgertory, a popular burger joint in the town, was set alight on Friday. There were clashes between police and protesters and the Shabbat service was cancelled. Mr Mashni said the gathering at Caulfield in a park across the road from a synagogue were Friday services were being held was not a protest but an “anti-racism vigil”. “They went to pray and to chant some anti-racism chants,” he said. Karvelas pressed whether “it was OK”, even though “Jewish people were terrified in Caulfield after that night, Mr Mashni doubled down that it was. “I’m hoping for a better tomorrow,” he said. “Can we not agree that as Australians, we should be having conversations, we should be talking about a space where we’re all together.” Ms Albanese also took issue with Mr Leibler’s accusation that she and Mr Mashni had “made it clear that in their view Israel has no right to exist as a state.” She said she found that statement “inappropriate and disrespectful”.

Incubators turned off in Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/no-longer-functioning-gazas-main-alshifa-hospital-is-on-the-brink-as-who-issues-frantic-warning/news-story/b6b0d8e991571a6e777c682ce4710c73,"A “dire and perilous” situation is unfolding in Gaza’s main hospital, with premature babies fighting for life as supplies quickly run out. Gaza City’s primary medical facility, Al-Shifa hospital, is experiencing a catastrophic near-complete power outage, as well as devastating shortages of food and water, medics working at the facility say. World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said “constant gunfire and bombings” in the area around the hospital have “exacerbated the already critical circumstances”, adding that the site “is not functioning as a hospital anymore”. Premature babies that were previously in incubators have since been moved to beds in a surgical ward, after a lack of electricity forced the neonatal unit to shut down. The Israeli military have reiterated that they were “ready to help” evacuate the dozens of vulnerable newborn babies being cared for at the site to another hospital. Israel’s government claim that the terror group Hamas, who perpetuated the kidnappings and murders on October 7, run their headquarters out of an intricate network under the hospital. Hospital chiefs deny this claim. The hospital’s head of surgery, Dr Marwan Abu Saada, revealed thata third premature newborn baby has now diedbecause of a lack of power, according to theBBC. According to the broadcaster, dozens of other newborns are currently not receiving the care they need, with Dr Abu Saada saying he was “afraid we are going to lose the lives of all [the] babies”. The third infant reportedly died from enteritis - an inflammation of the gut to which premature babies are particularly susceptible. Speaking to the BBC, a neonatal care expert said that keeping the babies warm was “vital”, explaining that moderately preterm babies, like those in Al-Shifa, must be kept at the right temperature. UK-based doctor Dr Kevin Goss, consultant neonatologist at Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton, says most, although not all, should normally be in an incubator, and have other basic needs. “Those babies wrapped up in those towels are relying on the ambient temperature,” he said. “Those in the foreground are going potentially to run into trouble quickly if you don’t have a source of heat to keep them warm.” In an update earlier today, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said that there are at least 2,300 people still inside the Al-Shifa hospital. The numbers have been provided to the World Health Organisation, who shared them in a post on X, formerly Twitter. The post claims that there are between 600 and 650 inpatients in the hospital, as well as 200 to 500 health workers and around 1,500 displaced people who have sought shelter. It adds that the lack of power, water, and food at the site is “putting lives at immediate risk”. The WHO repeats its call for an “immediate ceasefire” and the “active protection of civilians and health care”. Israeli president Isaac Herzog has again repeated an allegation that Hamas has its headquarters underneath Al-Shifa. Hamas has denied using the hospital for military purposes. The surgeon described Israel’s allegation as a “big lie” and issued an “open invitation” to its nearby forces to come and inspect the building. Gaza’s second-largest hospital – Al-Quds in Gaza City – is no longer operational, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Yesterday, thousands of displaced Palestinians looked to Gaza’s largest hospital as a safe haven, but withIsraeli strikes intensifyingand the fighting reaching the gates of the compound, there seems nowhere for them to escape. Ahmed al-Shawa, who sought refuge in the hospital, said he was afraid he would be “cut down by shrapnel”, if he stepped outside. “The situation is very, very dangerous,” the 18-year-old from Gaza City said as the sound of explosions echoed in the background. Crowds of people could be seen being crammed into the corridors of Al-Shifa to escape the fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, adding to the overwhelming number of war casualties at the hospital. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Horror scene as Parliament protest erupts,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/greens-leader-adam-bandt-addresses-propalestine-demonstration/news-story/ba671ecf661a534f857215388bf7eef5,"Hundreds of protesters gathered on the front lawns of Parliament House in Canberra, waving Palestinian flags in front of a confronting display of white cloths laid out to represent children killed in Gaza. The cloths were placed in bundles, with names and ages of those who had died in the conflict. They were laid between teddy bears and pairs of shoes, under a sign that read: “Stop the genocide in Gaza. Ceasefire now.” The 400 protestors, many arriving from Sydney and Melbourne, heard from members of the Free Palestine movement, including activists, academics and religious leaders, who called out the government’s inaction. “Albanese you can’t hide, you’re committing genocide,” the protestors chanted. With Labor is refusing to back calls for a ceasefire so far, many Muslim and multicultural communities have become increasingly angered by the government’s response. “We know we’ll be voting for the Greens. Labor be threatened. We’ll be using democracy to vote for the Greens,” the rally’s MC said. The MC also accused the government of being responsible for the bloodshed witnessed during the Israel-Hamas conflict. “Penny Wong, where are you? Where’s your consciousness? Albanese, where are you?” they said. “You have blood on your hands, blood stained hands.” A Palestinian flag was also erected by a demonstrator on one of the flag poles at Parliament House. “This is a message to the Israeli occupation: that we are from Australia, from stolen land, tell you we stand with the Palestinian people. We stand with the Indigenous people. We stand with hope,” the MC said. Greens leader Adam Bandt also addressed the crowd on Monday afternoon, where he was met with loud cheers. In his speech, Mr Bandt called for the government to immediately support a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel to prevent further casualties in Gaza, where the death toll has climbed about 10,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. “We now have over 11,000 civilians dead, over 4,000 of them children … Labor refused to join the rest of the calls of France and most of the rest of the world and call for a ceasefire,” Mr Bandt told the crowd. Bandt’s address follows comments from Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Sunday, where she called on Israel to halt attacks on hospitals in the embattled enclave to avoid further civilian deaths. “We need steps towards a ceasefire. It cannot be one-sided. We know that Hamas is still holding hostages, and we know that a ceasefire must be agreed between the parties,” Wong told the ABC’s Insiders program. But the comments failed to appease the Greens. “We are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe unfold in front of our eyes - no food, no water, no food, no fuel, people starving, dehydration, being bombed ... and yet still, Labor will not call for a ceasefire,” Mr Bandt said. “Labor says that it is concerned about the rising number of civilian casualties - so I ask the Prime Minister, how high does the number need to grow before Labor will join France and the rest of the world in calling for a ceasefire?” he asked. “How many more children need to die? How many more civilians need to suffer?” Mr Bandt promised that the Greens would continue to support the pro-Palestine cause. “We will come back day after day after day to call for a ceasefire now and an end to the occupation because Palestinians are entitled to live in the same just peace and security as Israeli,” he said. the approximately 400 protestors, many arriving from Sydney and Melbourne, heard from a members of the Free Palestine movement, including activists, academics and religious leaders, who called out the government’s inaction. “Albanese you can’t hide, you’re committing genocide,” the protestors chanted. With Labor refusing to back calls for a ceasefire thus far, many Muslim and multicultural communities have become increasingly angered by the government’s response. “We know we’ll be voting for the Greens. Labor be threatened. We’ll be using democracy to vote for the Greens,” the rally’s MC said. The MC also accused the government of being responsible for the bloodshed witnessed during the Israel-Hamas conflict. “Penny Wong, where are you? Where’s your consciousness? Albanese, where are you?” they said. “You have blood on your hands, blood stained hands.” A Palestinian flag was also erected by a demonstrator on one of the flag poles at Parliament House. “This is a message to the Israeli occupation: that we are from Australia, from stolen land, tell you we stand with the Palestinian people. We stand with the Indigenous people. We stand with hope,” the MC said.

Teal MP calls out ‘distressing’ anti-Jew hate,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/australian-jewish-association-starts-up-selfdefence-classes/news-story/d8f841cc553467741d40463b145a4cdc,"A prominent Teal independent has called out the surge in anti-Semitic sentiment washing over Australia in the wake of the October 7 Israel-Gaza war, saying members of her eastern Sydney community have been left “shaken and afraid”. “It’s very distressing that members of the Jewish community feel unsafe in Australia,” Wentworth MP Allegra Spender told NCA NewsWire. “Our country has been regarded as one of the safest places in the world, but the rise in anti-Semitism in recent years and especially in the last month has left many members of my community shaken and afraid.” Her remarks come as some Australian Jews plan to take-up self-defence classes to defend against possible assaults. The Australian Jewish Association, a grassroots social media page that tracks alleged anti-Semitic attacks, said on Sunday it would organise the classes in response to a rise in attacks on Jews. “The attacks on Jews have reached such a level that AJA will be assisting with organising self-defence training for the community,” the post on X states. “Initially in Sydney’s eastern suburbs. Stay tuned for more details.” AJA chief executive Robert Gregory, speaking on Monday, said there was a “lot of fear” in the community and the proposal to put on martial arts training for Jews had been met with an “overwhelming outpouring” of support. “There are a lot of people coming into our community to attack Jews, cause provocations,” he said. “A lot of assaults are unreported.” He said a Jewish martial arts expert had volunteered to put on the classes, which will roll out for people of all ages. Anti-Semitic acts have exploded across Australia after terror group Hamas massacred Israeli civilians on October 7 and Israel responded with a bombing campaign in Gaza. On early Sunday morning, popular Sydney Israeli restaurant Shaffa was vandalised and spray-painted with “child murder” and “steal our identity”. Last Friday, a synagogue was evacuated in Melbourne’s Caulfield after pro-Palestine protesters gathered at a nearby park. Mr Gregory said some Jews believed the NSW Police had not responded to threats against them with “enough force”. “A lot of people don’t think the police are stepping up at the moment,” he said. A NSW Police spokeswoman said the police would continue to engage with community groups and monitor events in Australia and abroad. “Our priority is to ensure that all members of the community feel safe and supported and are free to go about their daily lives without the fear of violence or discrimination,” the spokeswoman said. “The NSW Police Force launched Operation Shelter and the community can be assured we will continue to provide a safe environment for all and that appropriate policing responses are in place across the state.” Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said self-defence classes were “a good thing” but criticised the AJA’s post as “irresponsible”. “These sorts of social media posts are irresponsible as they create the perception that Jews face an immediate threat of being attacked on our streets, which isn’t the case,” he said. “We are urging vigilance while maintaining our way of life as Australians and Jews. “The concern is that things can spiral out of control very quickly. “The scenes from Caulfield … show that anti-Israel thugs are intent on harassing and intimidating Jewish Australians in their homes and in their synagogues. “We need other communities and particularly the federal government to dispense with pro-forma statements about Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and take the threat to Jewish Australians seriously.” Mr Ryvchin said the police were doing a “terrific job” in difficult circumstances and he had “no doubt” they were taking threats seriously and enforcing the law. “But in some cases the laws are unfit for purpose and the rolling anti-Israel protests not only create a massive drain on police and public resources, they are a key mechanism for inciting hatred towards Jewish Australians,” he said. The federal government has allocated $50m to support Jewish and Muslim communities affected by the Hamas attack on Israel and the war’s ongoing fallout. The ECAJ received $25m to enhance safety at Jewish schools and preschools across the country. Australian Palestinian and Muslim communities received $25m to improve safety measures. Ms Spender said she was in “frequent contact”with the Community Security Group, the NSW Police, the NSW government as well as the federal government about ensuring the safety of Wentworth’s Jewish community. “I know the authorities have increased their presence and other measures to keep our community safe,” she said.

"50,000 protesters swarm Sydney CBD",https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/50000-protesters-attend-propalestine-rally-at-sydneys-hyde-park/news-story/87662df957a0f66a3ac2b59b1dcb0c58,"Tens of thousands of pro-Palestine protesters flooded Sydney’s Hyde Park calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and condemning the Israeli government’s occupation of Gaza. Organisers claimed more than 50,000 people gathered in Sydney’s CBD at 1pm for a rally before attendees marched through the surrounding streets and returned to Hyde Park. For the fifth consecutive week, protesters waved the red, green, white and black flag of Palestine, with several wearing the kyfiya scarf in solidarity. Chants of: “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” and “Gaza, Gaza, don’t you cry, Palestine will never die,” were shouted by marchers. Speeches from organisers called for a ceasefire and more action from the Australian government. “I have a message for Anthony Albanese and I have a message for the Labor government: ‘What does Israel have to do to earn condemnation,’” said one speaker. “You look around here today, there are not just Muslims today, there are Muslims, there are Christians, there are Jews from Palestine. Every single person has come here today in pursuit of justice.” Earlier today Foreign Minister Penny Wong reiterated calls for Hamas to release Israeli hostages, however said the response couldn’t be “one-sided” and said a ceasefire agreement needed to be reached. “We do call on Israel to cease the attacking of hospitals,” she said. “We understand the argument that Hamas is burrowed into civilian infrastructure, but … I think the international community, looking at what is occurring in hospitals, would say to Israel: ‘These are facilities protected under international law and we want you to do so.’” NSW Police held a highly visible presence on Sunday afternoon at both Hyde Park and in Moore Park, where a pro-Israel ‘Set Them Free’ rally was held at the same time. Both events were attended by officers from Traffic and Highway Patrol Command, and Operation Shelter. In a statement, police said: “The NSW Police Force recognises and supports the rights of individuals and groups to exercise their rights of free speech and peaceful assembly, however, the first priority for NSW Police is always the safety and security of the wider community”. On Sunday, NSW Premier Chris Minns said increased police presence for a major protests costed “in excess of a million dollars,” however said there were “good discussions” between major protest groups, like the Palestine Action Group and police. “In recent weeks, there’s been good conversations between police and these groups, which have kept these protests civil (and) they’re going to have to continue to be because it’s our responsibility to keep the community safe,” he said. Mr Minns said while he believed “increased and heightened protests” were likely to continue in the next few months, he implored groups to follow the rules. “Protest is allowed in NSW but it needs to be done consistent with the law … You can’t allow hate speech in NSW, you can’t use it as a platform for racial vilification or incitement to violence, and the police have shown they will charge people who breach those rules,” he said.

Top Israeli drops one-word bombshell,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-minister-calls-gaza-operation-a-nakba-grave-fears-for-major-hospital/news-story/cdcc054fe9a434fc290e550d284978d6,"Progress has reportedly been made towards a deal that would see some hostages released by Hamas, in return for a days-long pause in the fighting. Publicly, however, the Israeli government maintains there will be no ceasefire unless every single hostage is let go. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war “is advancing with full force” and with only one goal, “to win”. “Grave fears” remain for patients in Gaza’s largest hospital, which ran out of power on Saturday. Israel says it will help facilitate the evacuation of 45 babies whose lives are at risk, though the Hamas-run Gazan health ministry maintains it has heard details of no such plan. And an Israeli minister has caused renewed outrage by referring to the operations in Gaza as a “Nakba” – a term which refers to the expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from what is now Israel in the late 1940s. “We are now actually rolling out the Nakba of Gaza. In the forefront, this is the Nakba of Gaza,” Avi Dichter told a national TV station. “So this is the Nakba of Gaza, Avi Dichter?” asked the channel’s host. “The Nakba of Gaza, 2023,” Mr Dichter affirmed. Progress made towards hostage deal Israel’s major news channels report some progress is being made towards a hostage deal, which would see Hamas release a group of female, elderly and young hostages in return for a temporary pause in the fighting. Hamas abducted hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals during its attack on southern Israel last month. A very small number have since been released, while the rest are reportedly being held inside the terrorist group’s vast network of underground tunnels. The reports in Israeli media suggest a deal would involve 50-100 hostages being released in stages during a pause in hostilities lasting three, or perhaps five days. Israel has previously been reluctant to allow a pause, believing it would allow Hamas to regroup. In his most recent public remarks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested a ceasefire would only be possible if all 239 hostages were released. “The war is advancing with full force, and it has one goal: to win,” he said. “There is no alternative to victory.” Aid agencies ‘complicit in Hamas’s strategy’ A spokesman for the Israeli government, Eylon Levy, has accused international aid agencies of being “complicit” in Hamas’s startegy of hiding behind Gaza’s civilian population. “International agencies in Gaza - the International Committee of the Red Cross, the World Health Organisation, the United Nations - have actively put Palestinian civilians’ lives at risk,” Mr Levy said. “For a month, they’ve refused to support an evacuation from the north. Now they’re endangering everyone by requiring a hasty evacuation in the middle of ground urban warfare. “We hold Hamas responsible for all tragic civilian deaths in Gaza - those killed by its misfired rockets and those it prevented from evacuating - but UN agencies also need to take a long, hard look in the mirror about their complicity with Hamas’s human shield strategy.” The agencies in question have argued that, with something like 1.5 million Palestinians displaced from their homes already and aid shelters well above their intended capacity, there is nowhere for them to escape to. They have also argued that, while urging civilians to evacuate from the north, Israel has continued to launch air strikes in the south of the Gaza Strip as well, meaning “nowhere” is entirely safe. ‘The Nakba of Gaza’: Minister’s stunning answer Avi Dichter is currently Israel’s Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, having previously served as Minister for Internal Security and Home Front Defence. Appearing onthe Israeli news channel N12, he described the current operations in Gaza a “Nakba”. The Nakba was the forced expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from what is now Israel in the late 1940s, which left much of the population – about 700,000 people – displaced. Some historians, though not all, consider it an example of “ethnic cleansing”. “When we see the pictures of a million residents of Gaza walking south with white flags, is this one of the goals, a psychological objective of the operation? Is this a strategic event, (or) is it temporary?” one of the network’s hosts asked Mr Dichter. “First and foremost, it is an operational event. We must understand, we have many of our fighters there, who need to operate in a densely populated area,” he responded. “To operate in a dense area, like there, filled with population, you want to reduce the number of people at the time.” “Is this a Nakba, or is it something temporary? Will they have somewhere to return to?” the host followed up. “We are now actually rolling out the Nakba of Gaza. In the forefront, this is the Nakba of Gaza,” Mr Dichter said. “So this is the Nakba of Gaza, Avi Dichter?” asked the host. “The Nakba of Gaza, 2023,” he affirmed. “Wait, does this mean they are not returning to Gaza City?” said the host. “Look, I don’t know how it will ultimately end. Because remember that Gaza City sits on a third of the Strip,” said Mr Dichter. “There are two more thirds of Gaza.” Mr Dichter has used the term before, in 2007, when he was Minister for Internal Security. “Whoever cries of the Nakba year after year shouldn’t be surprised if they actually have a Nakba eventually,” he said at the time. Biggest Gazan hospital at risk of ‘becoming a morgue’ “Grave concerns” remain for the al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, where the World Health Organisation says it has lost contact with its representatives, and the power has reportedly run out, putting patients’ lives at risk. The hospital, which is the largest in Gaza, has been surrounded by close-quarter fighting in recent days, as well as air strikes, complicating efforts to keep it running – and to evacuate young patients. “As horrifying reports of the hospital facing repeated attacks continue to emerge, we assume our contacts joined tens of thousands of displaced people and are fleeing the area,” the WHO said late on Saturday, local time. “If we do not stop this bloodshed immediately with a ceasefire, or at the bare minimum a medical evacuation of patients, these hospitals will become a morgue,” added the aid group Medicins Sans Frontieres on Sunday. Gaza’s health ministry, which is run by Hamas, says there are 1500 patients at al-Shifa hospital, 1500 medical personnel, and up to 20,000 people seeking shelter. One of those personnel, surgeon Ahmed al-Mokhallalati, told Al-Jazeera his colleagues “can hardly treat the patients” as they’re “in the middle of a war zone”. “There are continuous air strikes and the drones are hovering within the hospital area,” Dr al-Mokhallalati said. “The day before yesterday at about 2am, the electricity stopped because of some issues. The engineer who went to try to fix that was shot by a drone and injured in his neck. Four of his limbs are paralysed. “I saw a family of five in front of my eyes who tried to move east yesterday and they were shot. So they came back injured. “The Israelis also called the hospital director the day before yesterday ordering us to evacuate. He asked them to help arrange a way to evacuate the patients. They didn’t have a plan.” The Gazan health ministry claims two infants who were on incubators in the hospital have already died, and there are another 45 babies at risk. The Israeli military has said publicly that it will help evacuate the infants. However the ministry maintains it has “not been informed about any mechanism to get the babies out to a safer hospital”. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Wong under fire over ceasefire call,https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/penny-wong-says-australia-is-pushing-for-israeli-ceasefire-amid-concerning-hospital-reports/news-story/9d9a35d82007e603a47fe2a5ed46bf2c,"Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong has faced immense resistance from the opposition and Jewish leaders after asking the Israeli government to take steps towards a ceasefire. In what marked a language shift on behalf of the Labor government, Senator Wong called on Israel to stop the “attacking of hospitals” and voiced concern about the safety of civilians. She said how Israel defended itself mattered but when “we affirm Israel’s right to defend itself, what we are also saying is Israel must comply and observe international humanitarian law.” “We know Hamas is a terrorist organisation. It has demonstrated it has no respect for international law, but Australia is a democracy and so too is Israel, and the standards that we seek and accept are higher,” she told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday. Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan condemned Senator Wong’s comments as a display of “moral equivalence” and said they were extremely damaging amid reports of anti-Semitism towards Jewish and Israeli communities. “She needs to get her language right and she needs to condemn Hamas for their actions. She needs to condemn Hamas for holding Israeli hostages and she has to condemn Hamas for wanting to make sure that Israeli doesn’t exist as a state,” Mr Tehan told Sky News. More than 11,000 people in the Gaza Strip have been killed since October 7 when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, killing thousands and taking hundreds of people hostage. The Australian government has asked Israel to show restraint in its response to the terrorist attacks and allow for humanitarian pauses over recent weeks, with Senator Wong’s recent remarks signalling a major policy shift on the issue. The Zionist Federation of Australia and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said in a joint statement they were “highly concerned” by calls for Israel to stop striking hospitals in Gaza. Both groups have resisted Senator Wong’s remarks and claimed there was “no evidence” Israel was not abiding by the rules of armed conflict. “We remind the government that Article 19 of the Geneva Convention explicitly states that hospitals lose their protection if they are used for military purposes. It is incontrovertible that Hamas uses Shifa and other hospitals for military purposes,” the statement read. According to humanitarian medical charity Doctors Without Borders, about 650 patients, including 36 children, are trapped inside al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s biggest hospital complex, amid bombardment by the Israeli military. The World Health Organisation released a statement on Sunday calling the situation “dire and perilous”. Escalating conflict in the Middle East has triggered reports of death threats and street abuse against Jewish Australians, with violent clashes between Palestinian and Israel supporters reported in Melbourne over the weekend. This came after “shocking” figures from Victorian police showed there had been on average three reports of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic behaviour made every day since October 7. Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie said she had serious concerns for children’s safety and claimed there were kids who were “frightened to go to school” and express their religious identity in public. She joined the opposition in criticising Senator Wong’s choice of wording about a ceasefire and said the “sooner we rid the world of terrorists, the better world we will have”. “Penny’s not quite got her words right, but if you start having these ceasefires all you are letting (is) these terrorists regroup. For us to sit there and judge – we’re not even there on the ground with weapons in our hands. We need to be careful with our language,” Senator Lambie said.

Hamas hostage move shocks Israeli relatives,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-guns-silent-as-hostage-release-awaited/news-story/022901977b2d394a4e7f12488c5c189e,"Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a new wave of hostages Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners until Israel complies with a truce agreement, in a bitter blow to relatives. The second group was set to be released from Hamas custody at around 4pm local time, but two hours later IDF announced the hostages were being transferred to the Red Cross. Shortly after, Hamas claimed that the release was being delayed due to “Israeli violations” of a ceasefire deal. The Palestinian militant group’s armed wing said the issues of aid deliveries to the northern Gaza Strip and the selection criteria for prisoner releases were holding up the handover. Israel on Saturday denied that it had violated the truce agreement and vowed to continue the war to eliminate Hamas when the pause in fighting ends. “We will return immediately at the end of the ceasefire to attack Gaza,” Israeli chief of staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said. “We will also do this in order to dismantle Hamas, also to create a great deal of pressure to return as quickly as possible and as many abductees as possible, every last one of them.” The swap is being orchestrated as part of a temporary Israel-Gaza truce. A four-day ceasefire came into effect on Friday and largely silenced the guns on both sides. Israeli prison authorities said 42 Palestinian inmates – both male and female – would be freed under the terms of the agreement, which mandates exchanges at a ratio of three to one. An Israeli official source said 14 hostages would be handed over. It comes after video emerged of the first group of terrified women and children being handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross. The group included 13 Israeli hostages, 10 Thais and one Filipino, and Israel in turn freed 39 women and children from its prisons. “It’s only a start, but so far it’s gone well,” US President Joe Biden told reporters in Massachusetts. In the footage an elderly woman could be seen being carried by a Hamas soldier the short distance between the two vehicles, unable to walk. Another looked visibly distressed as she was ushered by Hamas towards the Red Cross. A young boy, nine-year-old Ohad Munder, could be seen being led towards Red Cross medical staff. Young Ohad could be seen looking bemused and scared as he was cuddled by a hooded Hamas fighter wearing a green bandana and combat fatigues. The boy’s family had pleaded for him to be released in mid-October as they feared he would spend his ninth birthday in the Hamas’ grips. Devastatingly, football-loving Ohad did just that. The youngster’s mum, Keren Munder, 54, could be seen following closely behind him today. A two-year-old girl was also among the group. Hostages freed in temporary truce The truce, mediated by Qatar, is expected to see a total of 50 hostages released during a four-day pause in fighting. Soldiers have been told not to answer questions from recently released child hostages such as “where's mum?” to avoid “overwhelming” them before they get to a place of safety. The advice comes as 24 out of an expected initial tranche of 50 plus hostages was released in Gaza. Hamas is thought to hold 240 people it snatched during the massacre on October 7. Those released age in range from two to 85. They include mum Dorn Katz-Asher, 34, and her children Aviv, 2, and Raz, 5, and another mum Danielle Aloni, 44, and he daughter Emilia aged 9. At around 4pm local time (1am Saturday AEST) 10 Thai hostages were freed. Minutes later, 13 Israeli hostages and one Philippines citizen were also freed. All of them were moved across the border to Egypt by the Red Cross. Egypt said the Thai releases was down to “intensive efforts” on its part. The 13 Israelis released followed equally intense negotiations between Israel, Hamas and The Gulf nation of Qatar which has played a key role in negotiations. Qatar said the group of 13 hostages released on Friday would be women and children. Over the four days, at least 50 hostages are expected to be freed, leaving an estimated 190 in the hands of Palestinian militants. In exchange, 150 Palestinians prisoners are expected to be freed from prison in Israel. The releases are coinciding with a four day pause in the conflict which has been raging for 48 days and killed thousands. It’s been seen by some as a “sign of hope” in a brutal conflict. Palestinian prisoners to be released The freed Israel hostages were taken to the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. From there they will be checked over in Egyptian hospitals and many will see their families for the first time in more than a month. They will then be transferred back to Israel either via a road crossing between Egypt and Israel or by helicopter. Hamas has said the prisoners freed from Israeli jails in return will include 24 women and 15 children. Most of those reside in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian prisoners will be freed from three jails then taken to the Ofer military camp near the Beitunia checkpoint on buses, an Israeli official told AFP on condition of anonymity. ‘A sign of hope’ In the West Bank, the BBC reported on people crowded around the Beitunia checkpoint where some of the prisoners are expected to be freed. “It’s a sign of hope for Palestinians and Israelis that the ceasefire will continue and the killing will stop,” Mohammed Khatib said. “We would have liked this to happen without the hostages taken by Hamas but without them, Israel would not let these people out.” ‘Where’s mum?’ Israel’s welfare ministry has issued gut wrenching guidelines about how to deal with recently released hostages, including children. Soldiers have been told not to answer if a child, held hostage for seven weeks, asks about his or her parents. “Children will ask questions such as, ‘Where’s Mum? Where’s Daddy?’ Soldiers should not answer these questions, even if they know the answers. Any questions should be answered along the lines of, ‘Sweetheart, I’m sorry, I don’t know. My job is to bring you to Israel to a safe place, where people you know will be waiting for you and will answer all your questions,’” the guidelines, seen byCNNsaid. Soldiers and other staff are told to not “verbally overwhelm” hostage children. “The use of simple words and short sentences is important. It is important to convey that we are open and able to hear and talk about difficult things.” The truce has triggered a mass movement of thousands of Gazans who had sought refuge in schools and hospitals from relentless Israeli bombardment begun after unprecedented attacks on October 7 by Hamas militants. “I’m going home,” Omar Jibrin, 16, told AFP after he emerged from a hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip where he and eight family members had sought refuge. For Khaled al-Halabi, the truce is “a chance to breathe” after nearly seven weeks of war that began when Hamas broke through Gaza’s militarised border to kill, according to Israeli officials, about 1,200 people and seize around 240 Israeli and foreign hostages. Mr Halabi had taken refuge in Rafah but is from Gaza City in the north, much of which has been reduced to rubble. Israel’s retaliatory air, artillery and naval strikes alongside a ground offensive have killed about 15,000 people, the Hamas government in Gaza said. Hopes for longer-term Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian agency, OCHA, expressed hope in Geneva that the pause “leads to a longer-term humanitarian ceasefire for the benefit of the people of Gaza, Israel and beyond.” The agreement came after weeks of talks involving Israel, Palestinian militant groups, Qatar, Egypt and the United States. According to the UN, 1.7 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people are estimated to have been displaced by the fighting. Now, thousands of them are trying to get home. In Khan Yunis, they loaded belongings onto carts, strapped them to car roofs, or slung bags over their shoulders, crowding streets to return to their homes from temporary shelters. Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets warning people that the war is not over and it is “very dangerous” to return north, the focus of Israel’s military campaign. But Abd el-Salam Matar, in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, said he wanted to go back to Gaza City. “I hope I can reach it,” he said. “We don’t know if our homes still stand, but we hope.” The truce was also a chance for some Palestinians to return to Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Further north, on the Lebanon-Israel border, calm also returned after regular deadly exchanges of fire, primarily between the Israeli army and Hezbollah. The Lebanese movement, like Hamas, is backed by Iran. Carefully prepared AFP has confirmed the identities of 210 of the roughly 240 hostages. At least 35 of those seized were children, with 18 of them aged 10 or under at the time. Hamas earlier released four women and Israeli forces rescued another. Two other captives, including a woman soldier, were found dead by Israeli troops in Gaza. Maayan Zin, whose eight- and 15-year-old daughters Ela and Dafna are among the hostages, posted on social media platform X that she had been informed their names were not included. “This is incredibly difficult for me; I long for their return,” she wrote. -with The Sun and AFP The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Israel supporter arrested at Palestine rally,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/courts-law/israel-supporter-arrested-at-propalestine-rally-in-sydney-cbd/news-story/025f0d16224da6eb0f9705cf5008a2b4,"A man’s been arrested and led away by police “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he unfurled an Israeli flag at a pro-Palestine rally in Sydney. Hundreds of school students skipped on Friday to gather in front of Town Hall in an event organised by High Schoolers for Palestine and University of Sydney group Students for Palestine, with similar events held in Wollongong and Byron Bay. A video from the rally, posted to social media platform TikTok, shows students chanting “From the river to the sea / Palestine will be free,” a rallying cry of Palestine supporters. The camera pans from the students over to a small group of people on the fringe of the rally who clearly support Israel, with the man at the centre of the video standing and brandishing an Israeli flag while he argues with a NSW Police officer. “Have you got your body camera on?” he asks the officer, who repeatedly tries to de-escalate the situation. “I’m not putting it down,” he tells the officer, before the video cuts to a short time later when the group of pro-Palestine students has turned to begin chanting in his direction. Police and media camera operators can be seen standing between the two groups, before the flag-bearing man begins repeatedly asking the officer “Am I under arrest?” Another officer steps in and forcibly moves the man away from the main protest, before the shot cuts to the man demanding the original officer take his hands off his wrist, as he points in the officer’s face. The man struggles and other officers step in, walking him further away. They can all be seen talking some distance away, while the man tries to film on his phone as the video ends. “Around 1.30pm … officers from the Central Metropolitan Region were facilitating a high-visibility operation at a public assembly at Town Hall, to ensure a peaceful demonstration,” NSW Police said in a statement. “Officers observed a man approaching the large group carrying a flag. “The 49-year-old was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace and was taken to Day Street Police Station.” It’s unclear at the time of writing if he’s been charged with any alleged offence. The arrest comes after tense clashes between protesters on both sides of the Middle East conflict and police in recent weeks. In a similar incident, another man waving an Israeli flag had to be removed by police after a pro-Palestine rally held outside Sydney Opera House in early October, just days after a Hamas raid on Israeli settlements escalated the conflict between the two nations.

‘Cynical’: Jewish anger at student rallies,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/school-life/sydney-propalestine-school-strike-last-appeal-to-get-students-to-skip-protest/news-story/22dd7c487131a4d85280b91ceff792f0,"Jewish leaders say school student rallies in support of Palestine are being hijacked by “hardened anti-Israel activists”. Hundreds of Sydney students on Friday attended a huge pro-Palestine school strike, defying pleas from politicians to stay in class. The event was organised by High Schoolers for Palestine and University of Sydney group Students for Palestine. Similar events are also being held in Wollongong and Byron Bay. Students dressed in school uniform and draped in Palestinian scarfs held signs with impassioned demands. “Stop killing us, we all deserve to live,” one sign read. But the Executive Council of Australian Jewry says these protests are causing damage and the students are being used. “We absolutely condemn the cynical recruitment of children to this extremist agenda,” co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said. “This may be presented as a spontaneous initiative led by idealistic high school kids but we know this is the latest stunt by hardened anti-Israel activists to advance their propaganda campaign.” He said those who have supported it – including some teachers and the Greens – should be “ashamed,” Mr Ryvchin said. “We are deeply concerned for the welfare of Jewish students and teachers and what awaits them when their peers, filled with racist slogans and violent chants, return to their classrooms,” he said. “The damage to our society and to our education system could be devastating and long-term. “That this has been allowed to happen is a failure of community, parenting and education that will require deep reflection and serious action.” Dozens of Palestinian flags were seen flying and countless posters voiced support for the Palestinian cause. “Free, free Palestine! Free, free Gaza,” students were heard crying out. Many older Australians also joined in the protest, but school and university students made up the majority of the hundreds gathered to protest. A similar protest attracted hundreds in central Melbourne on Thursday. Attendees reported that there was at least one Israel supporter who “put up a fight” at the beginning of the rally. They say he disrupted chants while waving an Israeli flag before he was escorted out by police. “Join students from across Sydney to demand an end to the genocide Israel is committing in Gaza,” the group wrote on social media before the protest. “These crimes against humanity are being cheered on by the Australian government. “Bring your friends and classmates and show that business as usual can’t continue while there is a genocide being committed in Gaza!” The protest is taking place without official approval, meaning children will be confined to footpaths and a heavy police presence is expected to keep the peace. Labor Party president and former treasurer Wayne Swan told Today that though the protest was not likely to be a “dramatic event”, there were concerns about “fringe groups” getting involved. Federal education minister Jason Clare told school students the best way to change the world was “go to school” ahead of the second day of student protests. He said schoolchildren “should be at school in school hours”, and his state and territory counterparts had the same view. “The important thing for students is that school is on. If you want to change the world, go to school,” he told Channel 7. “Education is the most powerful cause for good in this world. That is where you learn. “If you want to protest, do it on the weekend.” His panelmate, Deputy Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said social harmony was “very important in schools” amid reports a 16-year-old at Thursday’s protest had declared Hamas was “doing a good job”. “I’m very worried about the activists and their influence on schoolkids via social media,” she said. “I am not blaming the kids, there is some poisonous stuff circulating … pushed towards our schoolchildren, and it is causing some of the problems that we are seeing.” The rally in Australia’s biggest city follows similar protests in Melbourne and Adelaide on Thursday, students gathering in public places to show their support for Palestine’s cause. “We have come out today, people have left school en masse, to say that business as usual can’t continue when Palestinians are being slaughtered in their thousands,” one student protester said on a megaphone. “We know that a truce or a temporary pause to this atrocity is not enough. “We’re not fighting so there can be six hours in a day where Palestinians cannot be murdered. We are fighting so that there is never another Palestinian killed ever, ever again.” Some members of the Australian Jewish community have condemned the protests, saying they believe the protests are a “stunt” organised by anti-Israel activists. “We absolutely condemn the cynical recruitment of children to this extremist agenda,” Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Alex Ryvchin said. “This may be presented as a spontaneous initiative led by idealistic high school kids but we know this is the latest stunt by hardened anti-Israel activists to advance their propaganda campaign.” “Those who have supported it, including some teachers and the Greens, should be ashamed.” A leading vape advocate claims China is waging a “reverse opium war” on Australia because of a lack of proper regulation of the black market. It is Melbourne sparkly new suburb. But it appears there’s one glaring problem with the plan described today as “incredibly shortsighted”.

Israeli spokesman stunned into silence,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-arrests-director-of-gazas-alshifa-hospital-who-had-disputed-claims-of-hamas-presence-inside/news-story/180025e6ecac302bf40d195ebfb4c0a4,"A spokesman for the Israeli government was momentarily stunned into silence during an interview on British television overnight, as a breakfast news anchor grilled him on a looming pause in the Gaza war to facilitate the release of hostages held by Hamas. Eylon Levy appeared on Sky News UK to discuss the temporary ceasefire, which is expected to begin at 7am on Friday, local time, and last four or five days. Hostages will begin to leave Gaza at 4pm in the afternoon. In return for the release of 50 hostages - about a fifth of the 239 still being held in the Strip - Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners. That 3:1 ratio is the result of extended negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and helped by both Egypt and the United States. It is the bitter price Israel has accepted to bring some of its people home to safety. “I was speaking to a hostage negotiator this morning,” Sky News host Kay Burley said during the interview. “He made the comparison between the 50 hostages that Hamas has promised to release, as opposed to the 150 prisoners that are Palestinians that Israel has said it will release. And he made the comparison between the numbers, and the fact that - does Israel not think that Palestinian lives are valued as highly as Israeli lives?” Mr Levy took a beat before launching into an impassioned answer. “That is an astonishing accusation,” he said. “If we could release one prisoner for every one hostage, we would obviously do that. “We are operating in horrific circumstances. We are not choosing to release this prisoners, who have blood on their hands - we are talking about people who have been convicted of stabbing and shooting attacks. “I notice the question of proportionality doesn’t interest Palestinian supporters when they are able to get more of their prisoners out. “But really, it is outrageous to suggest that the fact that we are willing to release prisoners who are convicted of terrorism offences - more of them than we are getting our own innocent children back - somehow suggests that we don’t care about Palestinian lives? Really, that’s a disgusting accusation.” Burley, entirely unfazed, moved on to her next question, which was about the political future of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The question that so incensed Mr Levy had its origin in her earlier interview withDr James Alvarez, a pyschologist with experience as a hostage negotiator. When asked about the constantly mounting death toll in Gaza, and whether it could derail the prisoner swap negotiations. “One of the factors that makes me wonder is the asymmetry between the numbers - it’s 50 Israelis versus 150 Palestinians. That has an implication that, you know, that the individual worth of an Israeli is more than a Palestinian,” Dr Alvarez said. “I’m guessing that’s going to cause problems to the Palestinians.” The two interviews mentioned above came during a delay in the implementation of the temporary ceasefire, which was originally expected to begin on Thursday. A Palestinian official told AFP the delay was due to confusion over “last minute” details, namely which hostages would be released and how. Lists of the hostages to be freed had been exchanged by both sides, the Palestinian official said, citing his knowledge of the negotiations but asking to remain anonymous. It was unclear whether the Red Cross would have access to the hostages before their release into Egypt, and whether it would be able to care for those who remained behind. Qatar, which has acted as a mediator between Hamas and Israel, has announced the ceasefire will go into effect on Friday morning, with the hostage releases to begin in the afternoon. All of the Palestinians to be freed are either women or aged under 19. Israel arrests director of Gaza hospital Meanwhile Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip have arrested the director of its biggest hospital, as well as other medical personnel. “Dr Mohammad Abu Salmiya was arrested, along with several other senior doctors,” Khalid Abu Samra, a chief of department at the al-Shifa hospital, told AFP on Thursday, local time. Israeli Broadcasting Authority also reported on the arrests. Andthe Israeli publication Haaretz, citing an IDF source, said Dr Abu Salmiya had been arrested while in the humanitarian corridor heading towards the south of Gaza. “In the hospital, under his management, there was extensive Hamas terrorist activity,” the IDF said in a statement confirming the arrest. “Findings of his involvement in terrorist activity will determine whether he will be subject to further questioning.” Dr Abu Salmiya, in addition to being al-Shifa hospital’s director, is chairman of the Gaza Strip’s emergency committee. He has been a prominent voice in the international media since Israel began its military operation in response to Hamas’s atrocities on October 7. During those media appearances, he has repeatedly highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and strain on its hospitals – while unambiguously denying Israel’s claim that al-Shifa hospital acted as, or stood atop, a command centre for Hamas militants. “Doctor I wanted to ask you to address, directly, one of the main allegations about your hospital, al-Shifa hospital, and that is that you’re over the top of, or part of, a Hamas base,” he was asked duringan interview with America’s BreakThrough Newson November 9, for example. “This is pure slander,” Dr Abu Salmiya responded. “Al-Shifa is the largest hospital in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The largest hospital that includes all medical specialties – the largest nursery, the largest ICU, the largest dialysis department. And people come from all over the Gaza Strip. “Even now, in this war, when the representatives of the International Red Cross, the World Health Organisation, the United Nations visit us, they all come to al-Shifa. I do not think that, if it were a military base, such delegations could come to the hospital. “I do not think these people are sacrificing themselves coming to a Hamas military base. This accusation is totally unacceptable. “Not to mention that I asked, in more than one press conference, for any international organisation or any human rights organisation, or even any party specified by the occupation (by which he meant Israel) to come to our hospital. Search through our entire hospital, all its corridors, from top to bottom. All rooms will be open. “If there is a Hamas base, let the occupation do whatever the occupation wants. But this is a civil hospital that serves the wounded people.” Israel has accused the hospital’s medical staff, as well as international aid organisations, of being complicit in hiding Hamas’s military presence in the hospital. Since taking control of al-Shifa, it has presented evidence of militant activity, including security footage of hostages being transported through the building’s corridors at gunpoint, weapons it said were left behind by Hamas, and footage of underground tunnels the IDF believes were part of the terrorist group’s vast network. “It is important to emphasise that from the moment the IDF publicly exposed the use of hospitals for terrorist activity a few weeks ago, Hamas has persistently worked to conceal infrastructure and cover up evidence,” an IDF spokesman said last week. Hamas has long been known to hide among Gaza’s civilian population, and Israel alleges it uses structures like schools and hospitals as cover – a “human shield” strategy. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
‘Good job’: Striking student backs Hamas,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/stay-in-your-lane-nsw-education-ministers-warning-as-students-in-nsw-vic-prepare-to-walk-out-to-support-palestine/news-story/8202e14d6c854a9cc4e8a8a76210a7cc,"A teenager has been quoted sharing her support for terrorist organisation Hamas at a Melbourne school strike in support of Palestine. Speaking toThe Australian, the 16-year-old said she believed Hamas was doing a “good job” and said it wasn’t important to “stay in school when matters like this really matter”. “I think (Hamas) are doing a good job. I think they should stand up and protect … Palestine,” she said. “After what they’re putting my brothers and sisters through, I don’t think (Israel) should really exist.” The student, who was not named, was one of about 500 attendees who attended the rally in Melbourne’s CBD on Thursday. A Victoria Police spokesman said the group were compliant with police directions and there were no arrests. Students who attended the rally rebelled against pleas from politicians asking students to remain in class. “We are high school students and we understand the truth so why doesn’t everyone else?” one student said in an address to the crowd of teenagers. “There shouldn’t be a reason for us to be here today,” she said, in what appeared to be a deliberate response to politicians and media personalities who demanded they stay at school. “We’re here today to show solidarity with Palestinians, especially the children, the ones just like us but these children might not even make it to adulthood, and it won’t be abnormal like it is here.” Politicians across the divide have also urged students not to skip class ahead of a similar school strike planned in Sydney. Education Minister Jason Clare said the best way for school students to change the world was “go to school” ahead of the second day of student protests. He said schoolchildren “should be at school in school hours” and his state and territory counterparts had the same view. “The important thing for students is that school is on. If you want to change the world, go to school,” he told Channel 7. “Education is the most powerful cause for good in this world. That is where you learn. “If you want to protest, do it on the weekend.” His panelmate, Deputy Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said social harmony was “very important in schools”. “I’m very worried about the activists and their influence on schoolkids via social media,” she said. “I am not blaming the kids, there is some poisonous stuff circulating … pushed towards our schoolchildren, and it is causing some of the problems that we are seeing.” NSW Education Minister Prue Car has told students they should not be “skipping school” for protesting. “We understand that people feel passionately about a range of things, but you need to be at school,” she said. Speaking to 2GB on Thursday, she also urged university students promoting the strike on social media to “stay in their lane”. “They’re outside schools handing out things to school students, many of whom are in their first term of year 12. They’ve got important things to focus on,” she said. NSW Premier Chris Minns made on Wednesday said: “If you want to change the world, get an education and this is precisely why we have a world class public education system.” “We want young kids to be fully educated to be knowledgeable about the world to form their own views when they graduate from school. “To make school the enemy why striking against it, I think sends the wrong message about education.” The rally has been inspired by similar walkouts at schools in other countries including the US, UK and Canada. Event organiser Ivy, who played a part in the establishment of School Students for Palestine, said the walkout was a way for students to be heard. “Schools talk about politics all the time but on this issue we are silenced,” she said. “We are walking out because there’s genocide happening right now and we have to take action.” It’s a move that has sparked concern in the Jewish community, who penned an open letter to the state government claiming that the move could cause anti-Semitic behaviour, also stating the naivety of those likely to take part. “Most students in Victorian schools will not have a direct connection or a comprehensive (if any) understanding of the attacks on Israel and war in Gaza,” the letter said. The rally took began on the steps of Flinders Street Station. A similar protest is also planned for Thursday in Adelaide at Parliament House. One of the thousands of the petitioners who signed the letter asked parents to think of the dangers before supporting their child’s decision to protest. ”My message to fellow parents is please think really hard about whether you want your child exposed to violence, vandalism and graffiti with a group of people that you don’t know,” they told 9 News. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan said she expected students to stay in school on Thursday but that living in a democratic society included the right to protest. “We live in a democracy,” she said. “Being able to come together and hold a rally, a peaceful rally, depending on the issue that you’re concerned about or the issue that you’re exercised about, that’s a fundamental principle of our democracy that must not and should not change.” Real Schools chief executive Adam Voigt told the Today show the planned walkouts had put schools and its administrations in an awkward position. “It is a tricky issue for them to handle and to handle sensitively and with respect to the way that families are feeling,” he said. “The good part is from an operational point of view schools are well equipped. These are the people who switched to remote learning and did it really successfully. “They are trying to manage the people part of it and trying also to encourage their young people to be safe and I can understand that. “Tensions are high and schools are really trying to lean into their moral obligation at the moment.” The scheduled strikes have also been widely criticised by Jewish community groups. Executive Council of Australian Jewry co chief executive Alex Ryvchin feared the strike would alienate Jewish student. “This will cause incredible emotional harm to Jewish students,” he said. “Seeing their classmates chant slogans, march and wave placards that are hostile to their community, that ignore or deny the trauma of the October 7 atrocities, and which demonise their ancestral home will cause permanent damage to cohesion in classrooms. “Jewish students and teachers will never feel safe and accepted among colleagues and peers that participate in these actions.” Anti-Defamation Commission chairman Dvir Abramovich said the demonstrations were a “dangerous call to arms (that) will only inflame an already antagonistic environment”. “When Jewish parents send their children to school, there is an expectation that they will not be placed in a dangerous environment where they might be isolated or attacked for who they are,” he said. “In a climate of escalating anti-Semitism and a growing rhetoric of intolerance and radicalisation, words and images do matter.” To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

‘Indulgence’: Student strike plan lashed,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/school-life/peter-dutton-slams-victorian-student-plan-to-skip-school-for-palestine-protest/news-story/ccb65e05bc78e2833d515609c4d523e8,"Peter Dutton has condemned a planned Victorian school strike to protest Israel’s attacks in Gaza as he declined to support a ceasefire in the conflict with Hamas. The Opposition Leader said he “completely and utterly” disagreed with students who planned to walk out at lunchtime on Thursday to join a protest in Melbourne’s CBD. “If your numeracy and literacy rates were through the roof … then it’d be a different story,” he told 3AW. “But I think this is an indulgence. It’s a political statement. I think the teachers have a greater responsibility to our kids than to allow them out to march.” The Victorian Department of Education has made it clear that students are expected to attend school. Independent MP Allegra Spender, whose electorate of Wentworth is home to the largest Jewish community in Australia, said the protests risked isolating Jewish students. “Australians are distressed by civilian deaths in Israel and Gaza. It is heartbreaking. But we can’t let the conflict overseas create conflict here amongst us, and our children,” she said in a series of posts to X. “I urge all students to give some thought to the impact their actions may have on the mental health of their classmates, and look for ways to unify. We should all be doing all we can to maintain the social harmony that’s at the heart of this great multicultural country.” Mr Dutton made the comments ahead of an appearance alongside Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the launch of the Melbourne Holocaust Museum in Elsternwick. He said the bipartisan display of support would send a unified message that Australia was a “tolerant society” that didn’t accept hatred on any basis. “It’s just unacceptable that people feel the fear that they do now,” Mr Dutton said, referring to reports Jewish Australians were feeling unsafe in their communities. Mr Dutton was accused last week in parliament by Mr Albanese of weaponising anti-Semitism during a heated debate in which the Liberal leader sought to link the Middle East conflict and the release of detainees from immigration detention. Mr Dutton told 3AW he believed Mr Albanese’s remarks were just “his emotions speaking”. “I think that some of the comments that Penny Wong and others have made have been regrettable, but I think today is a day of coming together and making sure that we talk with one voice and that is that we have zero tolerance for anti-Semitism,” Mr Dutton said. On whether he would support a ceasefire in Gaza, the Liberal leader said he believed “Israel has to deal with the threat of Hamas”. “This is the extermination of a race. This is the hatred that knows no bounds,” Mr Dutton said. “Israel wasn’t shelling Gaza on the 6th of October. They responded to the Hamas attacks. We should always remind ourselves of that.” In his speech at the museum’s opening, Mr Dutton called for “moral courage and clarity” in unequivocally condemning anti-Semitism. Mr Albanese said Australians should not allow anti-Semitism to gain a foothold here as the conflict continued. “Australia will always denounce it and reject it utterly, just as we do all forms of racism and prejudice,” he said.

‘Pros’ blamed for ugly Palestine protest,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/chaotic-clash-between-police-and-propalestine-protesters-at-port-botany-rally/news-story/15b188959308d499cb8fb7e7ff0cdafb,"“Professional protesters” have been blamed by the NSW Police Commissioner for chaotic clashes between a pro-Palestine rally and officers overnight. A child was carried to safety through the crowds as chaotic scenes unfolded in Sydney’s Port Botany on Tuesday night, with protesters accusing police of “heavy-handed” treatment. Officers arrested and charged 23 people from the 400 who had gathered at the port’s shipping terminal to call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and protest the arrival of a container ship owned by an Israeli company. “I would say broadly that most or a great large number were professional protesters who currently are protesting about the Gaza conflict but next week, they’ll probably protest about something else,” Commissioner Karen Webb told reporters on Wednesday morning. Acknowledging the “combustible situation” prompted by Israel launching attacks on Palestine’s Gaza Strip in response to a Hamas attack on October 7, Ms Webb said police had been working to manage dozens of protests across the state that had been conducted peacefully. “What we need to do is manage the right to protest while protecting public safety and cohesion and ensuring people don’t breach the laws,” she said. “I’m not saying anyone’s performing that perfectly, but when it comes to the rest of the world, certainly in the last six weeks, NSW Police have been working hard to ensure that we don’t have violent demonstrations on city streets.” At one point, protesters lifted a pram with a child inside through the masses as its mother tried to escape the scuffles between protesters and police. “A child in a pram having to be crowd-surfed by protesters to get it out of a violent scuffle caused by police removing people at the blockade at Port Botany tonight,” one protester wrote on social media about the incident. Vision of the protest later into the night showed police clashing with some members of the group. One video shows four officers scrambling to pin a man to the ground to arrest him. “Let him go, let him go,” the protesters chanted as they yelled at them to stop. Other video shows officers pulling up protesters who were sitting on the ground and leading them away as they struggled. Police on horseback also charged through the crowd, pushing and corralling them towards the exit. Some protesters described the actions of police as “sickening”. “Violent, unjustified thuggery from NSW Policetowards a peaceful crowd which included children,” one wrote. A NSW Police spokesperson said officers had issued multiple move-on directions to the group and individuals that were “not complied with”. They said officers began arresting people when the group blocked cars from moving through Foreshore Rd in Port Botany. “After a number of people continued to refuse police direction, 23 people were arrested before all people left the roadway about 9pm,” the spokesperson said. “All 23 people were taken to several police stations, where they were charged with the offences of fail to comply with move on direction and damage or disruption to a major facility.” The protest action has been met with dismay by Jewish groups, with Council of Australian Jewry chief executive Alex Ryvchin arguing the latest incident shows that the pro-Palestine movement is “about hatred and destruction”. “Whether they are organising boycotts of Jewish businesses, screaming at ships or manipulating schoolchildren to support them, these actions are a threat to public safety, and they incite violence and hatred,” Mr Ryvchin said. “There is a co-ordinated effort to marginalise and endanger Jewish Australians and rip our society apart and it must be stopped.” Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil weighed in on the protest on Wednesday morning, saying protesters who had “targeted violence at police” were “utterly despicable”. “We have law enforcement officials who put on a uniform every day to keep your family safe and my family safe and to subject to them any form of violence is inexcusable,” she said on the Today show. “What I know is that we can get through this because we get through a lot of hard things as a nation and we do it by wrapping our arms around each other and showing each other respect and empathy and tolerance.” She was then pressed on the matter by the show’s host Karl Stefanovic, who said the government’s calls for cohesion were “failing”. “I don’t agree with that, I think for the most part people are being really respectful of each other. Yes, we have these flare-up incidents where there is violence and I do condemn this and I ask please don’t let it get to that point,” she said. Nationals deputy leader Perin Davey defended the actions of police, saying that they needed to ensure that the port could continue to function “to keep freight moving and industry moving”. “Police are in a difficult situation – they will need to move in and clear the way because that is their role,” she said on the Today show. “They will need to clear the way for things to get through, but any time they go near a protester they will be accused of some heavy-handed tactic, I do feel for them here.” She criticised the actions of protesters, saying that laws needed to be respected. “It was anti-Semitic against an Israeli company that wanted to stop trade, we need to call this out,” she said. “People who are saying we should boycott pro-Israeli businesses, what they are really saying is we need to boycott Jewish businesses and that is anti-Semitic and we need to call it out from the get-go.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Major breakthrough in horrific Gaza conflict,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hopes-for-hostages-as-israel-hamas-qatar-say-progress-in-talks/news-story/e9190cbf43c7b95254390bca008fafc1,"Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on a four-day humanitarian pause in exchange for the release of 50 hostages in Gaza, Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed in a statement on Wednesday. “The agreement includes the release of 50 civilian women and children hostages currently held in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons, the number of those released will be increased in later stages of implementing the agreement,” the statement said. It came as Israel’s government approved a deal early on Wednesday to free 50 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and a truce, according to an official statement sent to AFP by the Prime Minister’s office. “The government approved the broad outlines of the first stage of an agreement under which at least 50 kidnapped people — women and children — will be released over four days during which there will be a lull in the fighting,” the statement said. “The Israeli government, the Israeli army and the security forces will continue the war to bring back all those kidnapped, eliminate Hamas and ensure that there is no longer any threat to the State of Israel from Gaza.” Earlier, hopes were mounting that Hamas could release dozens of hostages from war-torn Gaza after the militant group’s leader and key mediator Qatar said a truce deal was in sight and the Israeli PM pointed to “progress”. The announcements were the most optimistic yet of a potential breakthrough in the conflict, which has been raging for more than six weeks and left thousands dead on both sides. “We are close to reaching a deal on a truce,” Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said, according to a statement sent by his office to AFP. In Qatar, foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said “we’re very optimistic, very hopeful” and told reporters, “We are at the closest point we ever had been in reaching an agreement.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has vowed to destroy Hamas, was more circumspect, telling soldiers at a military base only that “we are making progress” on the return of hostages. “I hope there will be good news soon,” he added, with speculation an announcement could be made as soon as Tuesday evening, Jerusalem time, after his office announced meetings of his war and security cabinets and government. In Washington, US President Joe Biden, who does not support a full ceasefire, said a temporary truce was “now very close”. “We could bring some of these hostages home very soon,” he said at the White House. “But I don’t want to get into the details of things because nothing is done until it’s done.” Truce deal Hopes of a release deal have been mounting since Qatar on Sunday said only “minor” practical issues remained. Speculation grew further when the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is often involved in prisoner exchanges and hostage releases, said on Monday its president had met Haniyeh in Qatar. Despite talk of a temporary truce, fighting raged on in Gaza’s bloodiest ever war, sparked by the October 7 attack in which Israel says Hamas gunmen killed around 1200 people, mostly civilians. In retaliation, Israel launched a relentless bombing campaign and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip. According to the Hamas government, the war has killed more than 14,100 people, including nearly 6000 children and close to 4000 women. Sources from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which also participated in the attacks, told AFP on condition of anonymity that their groups had agreed to the terms of a truce deal. The tentative agreement would include a five-day truce, comprised of a complete ceasefire on the ground and an end to Israeli air operations over Gaza, except in the north, where they would only halt for six hours daily. Under the deal, which the sources said could yet change, between 50 and 100 Israeli civilian and foreign hostages would be released, but no military personnel. In exchange, some 300 Palestinians would be freed from Israeli jails, among them women and minors. The BRICS group of nations including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called for an “immediate, durable, and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities” in Gaza, during a summit in Johannesburg aimed at drawing up a common response to the conflict. Respite Rafah resident Hamza Abdel Razeq said a ceasefire would bring some respite for Gazans who have endured Israel’s bombing and expanding ground offensive. “The people are really suffering,” he told AFP. “If they reach a five-day truce deal now, I believe it will pave the way for longer truces or even a total ceasefire.” Another resident, Mahmud Abu Najm, added: “We … pray to God for its success because the people are enduring an unbearable situation.” Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air strikes, and the territory is under siege, with minimal food, water and fuel allowed to enter. According to the Hamas and Islamic Jihad sources, the proposed deal would also allow for up to 300 trucks of food and medical aid to enter Gaza. Israel has vowed to press on with its offensive, pledging to crush Hamas and ensure the hostages are released. The Israeli military meanwhile said air strikes had hit “around 250” Hamas targets in the past day, destroying three underground shafts in the Jabalia area, which it said it had fully surrounded. Two Israeli soldiers were killed “in operational activity” in northern Gaza, it added. In Lebanon, official media said two journalists from Al-Mayadeen television and two other civilians were killed in cross-border shelling in the south. Israel said only it was “looking into the details” of the incident. The Committee to Protect Journalists said 53 journalists and media workers have now been killed since Israel declared war on Hamas. Meanwhile, the health ministry in the occupied West Bank said the Israeli army killed one Palestinian in Nablus. Premature Medics and patients have been increasingly caught up in the fighting, as Israel expanded its operation across northern Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Israel had laid siege to and hit the Indonesian Hospital in Jabalia on Monday, killing dozens, but there was no independent confirmation of the toll. Twenty-eight premature babies from Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, were taken to Egypt for treatment on Monday. Three others evacuated from Al-Shifa remain in southern Gaza, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday. Two babies died before the evacuation, the UN agency said. The Indonesian Hospital lies near Gaza’s largest refugee camp Jabalia, which has been the scene of intense Israeli bombing in recent days. The health ministry official said there were still about 400 patients inside the hospital, as well as 2000 people seeking shelter. Around 200 people were evacuated from the hospital on Monday and bussed to the relative safety of a hospital in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza. At the packed Al-Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, an AFP reporter saw bloodied children being carried in and lying dazed on gurneys. Criticism Israel says Hamas uses medical facilities to hide fighters and as bases for operations, making them legitimate military objectives, while insisting it does everything possible to limit harm to civilians. But criticism of Israel’s conduct of the war has grown, from international agencies and some governments, with protest marches held across the world. The WHO said it was “appalled” by the strike on the Indonesian Hospital, calling it just one of 164 documented attacks on health facilities and workers since the war began. The UN children’s agency meanwhile warned that fuel shortages and worsening sanitation in Gaza were shaping up to be “a perfect storm for tragedy” through the spread of disease. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

‘Death zone’: Sign war will escalate,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-expands-gaza-operation-amid-hostage-deal-talks/news-story/e1a2c133878d59fdfccc446195f410d1,"Gaza is bracing for a further expansion of Israeli military operations even as cautious hopes built for a deal to release hostages in exchange for a pause in fighting. The Israeli army said on Sunday they were taking their fight against Hamas militants to “additional neighbourhoods” of the Gaza Strip, where an aerial and ground offensive has already killed 13,000 people including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run government. The bloodiest ever Gaza war started with the shock October 7 Hamas attack that Israeli officials say left 1,200 people dead and saw 240 taken hostage. Qatari mediators said on Sunday talks on a deal that would free some of the hostages were progressing, held up only by “very minor” practical challenges, though neither details nor a timeline were provided, and Israel and Hamas have said little. An Israeli strike on the Indonesian Hospital near northern Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp -- the territory’s largest -- killed 12 people, including patients, and wounded dozens more, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday. An AFP journalist saw columns of smoke rising from Jabalia on Sunday, one day after a health official said more than 80 people had been killed in twin strikes there, including on a UN school sheltering displaced people. Social media videos verified by AFP showed bodies covered in blood and dust on the floor of a building, where mattresses had been wedged under school tables. Israel’s military has said Jabalia is among the areas of focus as they “target terrorists and strike Hamas infrastructure”. Without mentioning the strikes, the Israeli army said “an incident in the Jabalia region” was under review. ‘Act urgently’ The violence in Jabalia was the latest to draw strong condemnation from Arab and other governments. On Monday foreign ministers from the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Indonesia held meetings on the war in Beijing, where their Chinese counterpart Wang Yi said the world must “act urgently” to stop the “humanitarian disaster” in Gaza. “The situation in Gaza affects all countries around the world, questioning the human sense of right and wrong and humanity’s bottom line,” Wang told the visiting diplomats. Six weeks into the war, Israel is facing intense international pressure to justify the bloody toll. Israeli officials have warned a “window of legitimacy” for the war to rout Hamas may be closing. Israel on Sunday presented what it said was evidence Hamas gunmen used Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, to hide foreign hostages and to mask underground tunnels. The hospital has been a focal point of global concern after Israeli forces launched a raid of the facility last week, with the World Health Organisation calling it “a death zone”. Israel has repeatedly claimed that Al-Shifa and tunnels beneath it double as a base for Palestinian militants, a charge Hamas and hospital administrators deny. The Israeli military released what was said to be CCTV footage from October 7 of two male hostages, from Nepal and Thailand, being brought into the hospital. “We have not yet located both of these hostages,” army spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters. One clip showed a man in shorts and a pale blue shirt being dragged into an entrance hall by five men, at least three of whom were armed. In a second clip, an injured man in underwear is wheeled in on a gurney by armed men as several others wearing blue hospital scrubs look on. AFP could not immediately verify the footage. Israel also accused the Palestinian militant group of executing 19-year-old Israeli soldier Noa Marciano at Al-Shifa and presented images of what it said was a 55-metre (180-feet) tunnel under the hospital. Over the weekend, hundreds of people fled Al-Shifa hospital on foot as loud explosions were heard around the complex. Columns of sick and injured were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors and nurses, and the UN said 31 premature babies were evacuated from the facility. At least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, were strewn along the route, an AFP journalist said. Al-Shifa head of surgery Marwan Abu Sada told AFP that Israeli troops were still in the hospital and it was surrounded by tanks. “I heard at least two explosions since this morning,” he said Sunday. Other doctors said the troops were going from building to building and detonating explosives on the ground floors and hospital basements searching for Hamas tunnels. Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas and has refused to heed calls for a ceasefire before all the captives are released. The bodies of two female hostages, including the soldier, were recovered in Gaza, the Israeli military said last week. Four abductees have so far been released by Hamas and a fifth rescued by troops. Qatar’s prime minister said efforts to bring hostages “safely back to their homes” in return for a temporary ceasefire was now within reach, raising hopes that Israeli, American or other captives could soon be free. “I’m now more confident that we are close enough to reach a deal,” said Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, adding that only “minor” practical details remained unresolved. The hostages include infants, teens and pensioners. Their fate has wracked not just their families but the Israeli public at large. US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told US media that negotiators were “closer than we have been in quite some time” to securing a deal. But he cautioned: “The mantra that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed really does apply.” In London, the teary father of missing nine-year-old Emily Hand begged for her to be brought home. “There’s just a big, big hole in all our hearts that won’t be filled until she comes home again,” he told AFP. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Israel fumes at ‘preposterous’ accusation,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-benjamin-netanyahu-fires-back-at-utterly-preposterous-accusation/news-story/3f3ea089d61c273296c0b3ed3fecf835,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has furiously denounced claims from the Palestinian Authority regarding the October 7th attacks carried out by Hamas on Israel. On Sunday, the PA denied that Hamas terrorists were responsible for the deaths of approximately 350 people at the Nova music festival, laying the blame on “Israeli helicopters”. According to a statement from the PA Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was distributed to the United Nations and foreign ministries worldwide, “the preliminary investigation by the Israeli police proved that on October 7 Israeli helicopters bombed Israeli citizens who participated in the nature festival”. “The result of this investigation casts doubt on the Israeli reports regarding the destruction and killing that took place in that area,” the statement continued. The PA based its assertions on an October 18 report, which referred to an investigation of the massacre and cited an unnamed Israeli police official saying that the investigation found that an IDF combat helicopter arrived at the scene and fired at the terrorists. According to theIsraeli press, the PA also claimed that Israel had “fabricated” media material to justify its offensive against Hamas. The Israel Police clarified the report on Sunday after being thrust into the middle of ongoing tensions between the two countries. “Contrary to the publication, the police investigation does not refer to the activity of the IDF forces, and therefore no indication was given of any harm to civilians caused by any aerial activity at the site,” a statement by the Israel Police Spokesperson’s Office read. “Particularly at this time, we call on the media to show responsibility in their reporting, and to base their journalism on official sources only.” Speaking on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu branded the accusations as “utterly preposterous” and a “complete reversal of truth”. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid joined the condemnation of Palestine’s government, labelling the statement “abominable and false”. “Today, the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah said something utterly preposterous. It denied that it was Hamas that carried out the horrible massacre at the nature festival near Gaza. It actually accused Israel of carrying out that massacre. This is a complete reversal of truth,” Mr Netanyahu said. Mr Netanyahu also made reference to a recent controversy involving Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, who claimed Jews in the Holocaust were killed because of their “social role” and not their religion. The televised comments sparked a tidal wave of backlash, with dozens of leading Palestinian intellectualspublishing an open lettercondemning Mr Abbas’ “antisemitic” remarks. Mr Netanyahu later seized the opportunity to direct the matter towards Israel’s plan for the region following the IDF’s campaign to eradicate Hamas. “My goal is that the day after we destroy Hamas, any future civil administration in Gaza does not deny the massacre, does not educate its children to become terrorists, does not pay for terrorists and does not tell its children that their ultimate goal in life is to see the destruction and dissolution of the State of Israel,” Mr Netanyahu continued. It came after French President Emmanuel Macron told Mr Netanyahu there were “too many civilian losses” in the current war against Hamas in Gaza. The retaliatory Israeli air and ground campaign has killed 13,000 people in Gaza, mainly civilians and including thousands of children, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. Macron, whose country is a firm ally of Israel, reminded Netanyahu of the “absolute necessity to distinguish terrorists from the population” and “the importance of achieving an immediate humanitarian truce leading to a ceasefire”. Mr Macron also condemned violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank in a conversation with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, the French presidency said. The French leader told Mr Netanyahu about his “great concern over the escalation in violence against Palestinian civilians” in the West Bank and called for calm. Mr Macron also told Abbas of “the need for the Palestinian Authority and all countries in the region to unequivocally and with the greatest firmness condemn the terrorist attack carried out by Hamas in Israel on October 7”. Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 200 Palestinians in the West Bank since the war began, according to the health ministry in Ramallah. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Starbucks store smeared with red substance,https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/starbucks-store-shuttered-in-melbournes-cbd-after-propalestine-graffiti/news-story/19718e9e89dfab298c334a543611b9d1,"A busy Starbucks store in Melbourne’s CBD was reportedly forced to close after it was plastered with anti-Israel ﻿images and smeared with an unknown bloodlike substance. Images and video shared widely online showed the extent of the graffiti, which included stickers stating “This company supports genocide” and calls to boycott Israel. In a statement, police said they were investigating reports of graffiti at the store on Swanston St on Sunday and called for anyone with information to come forward. “Officers are making further inquiries after becoming aware of the graffiti on November 19. An investigation into the incident remains ongoing,” they said in the statement. Companies operating inside Israel or have perceived to support the Jewish state since its invasion of Gaza last month have come under increased attack by Palestine activists. Free Palestine Printing, which produces pro-Palestine paraphernalia, shared video of the graffiti to its TikTok, with the caption: “We will never drink awful coffee again.” In a video reposted to their Instagram, the organisation stated that the store would be closed on Sunday and other businesses were also shuttered or closed early. The organisation also shared video of pro-Palestine stickers being placed on self-service kiosks inside a McDonald’s store, including one of a red cross through the Israeli flag. Users online reacted with mixed views to the graffiti, with some mirroring criticism of Starbucks while other users instead urged patrons to support their local cafe. “I reckon this needs boycotting for the sh**ty quality of its coffee — what I don’t get is why it took Jewish-Arab conflicts to buy our own objectively superior coffee,” one said. Free Palestine Printing is not accused of any wrongdoing and has been contacted for comment. A spokesperson for Starbucks said on Monday its Australia stores were open. Police have recovered a one tonne piece of the wreckage of a tragic plane crash that killed two off the coast of Victoria.

Israel and Hamas ‘close’ to shock ceasefire,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-and-hamas-reportedly-close-to-temporary-ceasefire-brokered-by-the-united-states/news-story/6ddab4e0a430738b406c73ae193e61f2,"Israel and Hamas are reportedly close to striking a deal that would see the war in Gaza pause for five days in exchange for the release of dozens people being held hostage there. Hamas abducted hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals during its surprise attack on southern Israel last month. Those who remain – Israel believes there are still 239 hostages – are likely being held in the terrorist group’s network of underground tunnels. According toThe Washington Post, the looming ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the United States,would require both sides to stop fightingfor at least five days. An unknown number of hostages, likely women and children, would then be released in batches every 24 hours. The newspaper cites “people familiar with the emerging” deal, as well as a six-page document detailing the proposed terms. An anonymous Biden administration official said the US had been “working hard to advance” the potential ceasefire deal and progress had been made, but stressed that the situation in Gaza remains “volatile”. Officially, a spokeswoman for the White House’s National Security Council, Adrienne Watson, said: “We have not reached a deal yet, but we continue to work hard to get to a deal.” International discomfort with the mounting civilian death toll in the Gaza Strip, and repeated demands that Hamas release the hostages, have put mounting pressure on both sides to reach agreement on a temporary pause. Gaza’s biggest hospital ‘a death zone’ As of yet, however, there is no ceasefire. Danger remains throughout Gaza, and according to the World Health Organisation, particularly at the Strip’s largest hospital, which it described as a “death zone”. That assessment came after a visit to the hospital by WHO and other United Nations officials. Elsewhere, a Hamas health official claimed more than 80 people were killed on Saturday in twin strikes on a northern Gaza refugee camp, including on a UN school which was sheltering displaced people. Social media videos verified by AFP showed bodies covered in blood and dust on the floor of a building where mattresses had been wedged under school tables in Jabalia, which is the largest of Gaza’s refugee camps. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, the UNRWA, described “horrifying images” from the incident, while Egypt called the bombing a “war crime” and “a deliberate insult to the United Nations”. A separate strike Saturday on another building in Jabalia camp killed 32 people from the same family, 19 of them children, Hamas health authorities said. Without mentioning the strikes, the Israeli army said “an incident in the Jabalia region” was under review. The Israeli military’s relentless air and ground campaign has since killed 12,300 people, more than 5,000 of them children, according to the Hamas government, which has ruled Gaza since 2007. The UN says some 1.6 million people have been displaced inside the Gaza Strip by the six weeks of fighting, and Israel said on Saturday its military was “expanding its operational activities in additional neighbourhoods”. ‘Extreme suffering’ Gaza’s largest hospital, al-Shifa, has been a key focus in recent days, with Israeli forces alleging Hamas uses it as a command centre – a claim denied by the group, and also by the hospital’s medical staff. On Sunday, the WHO described a mass grave at the entrance and said nearly 300 patients were still inside, along with 25 health workers. It said it was planning “the immediate evacuation of the remaining patients, staff and their families”, warning, however, that nearby facilities were already overstretched. The WHO urged an immediate ceasefire, given the “extreme suffering of the people of Gaza”. On Saturday, hundreds of people fled the hospital on foot on orders from the Israeli army, according to the facility’s director. Columns of sick and injured – some of them amputees – were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors and nurses, as loud explosions were heard around the complex. At least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, were strewn along the route, lined with heavily damaged shops and overturned vehicles, an AFP journalist there said. Non-government group Doctors Without Borders said a convoy carrying its staff and family members came under attack Saturday while evacuating from near al-Shifa, even though it had co-ordinated with both sides. One person was killed. The WHO said 29 patients at the hospital with serious spinal injuries cannot move without medical assistance, and others have infected wounds due to lack of antibiotics. There are also 32 babies in “extremely critical condition,” WHO said. The Gaza health ministry later said 30 premature babies had been evacuated from the hospital, and would be relocated to hospitals in Egypt. – with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Horror blood display at Palestine rally,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/politics/shocking-slogans-and-a-fake-bloodied-corpse-show-fury-in-palestine-rallies/news-story/10e36ba7637f6e28023457c33fd7e49a,"Sunday’s anti-Israel protests in Sydney and Melbourne have put on confronting displays of fake bloodied corpses and compared the Jewish state to Nazi Germany in a stark display of the fury propelling the Pro-Palestine movement. The Sydney rally, organised by the Palestine Action Group Sydney, gathered at Hyde Park at 1pm, demanding an end to what it called Israel’s “massacre” in the Gaza. “We need everyone to help us spread the word and convince more and more people to take a stand and fight to stop this genocide,” the group said on Facebook. A mass of Palestinian flags were seen waving in the hot sun and people with black shirts reading: “Stop the Genocide”. A boy is also seen carrying a heap of towels wrapped in a bedsheet marked with red colours to represent the body of a dead Palestinian child. Another sign from the rally reads: “Queer Jews Against Another Holocaust”. A man at the rally could be seen with a shirt that reads: “from the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free”, a regular pro-Palestine slogan that some critics interpret as a call for the destruction of the Jewish state. In Melbourne, the marchers gathered at the State Library. “Israel has pounded the Gaza Strip for over a month. Thousands of Palestinian men, women and children have been killed, and thousands more are injured,” Free Palestine Melbourne said on Facebook. “All this is a continuation, in horribly escalated form, of the 75 years of war that Israel has waged on the Palestinian people, including 16 years of brutal siege on Gaza.” Israel left the Gaza strip in 2005 and terror group Hamas seized control of the densely populated slip of land, murdering Palestinian opponents to its regime. Photos from the Melbourne rally show Palestinian flags marked out with bloody fists and messages scrawled on red, white and green hearts reading: “end the siege of Gaza” and “shame Israel shame”. Another sign suggests Israel has played the “victim” in world history, reading: “sorry Israel, your victim card is declined”. Another sign bears images of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and Jewish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next to each other, with the phrase: “same s**t, different a**hole”. Adolf Hitler led the Nazi war machine that slaughtered six million Jews in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. The police have allocated substantial resources to the rallies to maintain public safety. Rallygoers are demanding a ceasefire to the war and Sunday’s marches coincide with a possible agreement between Israel and Hamas to cease hostilities for a five-day period. US media outlet The Washington Post reports the US-brokered ceasefire would allow both sides to free female and child hostages. The most recent outbreak in war began on October 7, when Hamas butchered hundreds of Israeli civilians, including the elderly, women and children, in a surprise attack on the Jewish state. The terrorists kidnapped 240 Israelis, holding them hostage in Gaza. Israel responded with force, bombing the slip of land. The bombing campaign, though directed at Hamas fighters, has resulted in thousands of Palestinian deaths, including children and Palestinian men and women who are not associated with Hamas. The contest has triggered furious passions in Australia, with multiple pro-Palestine rallies in all major cities across the country. Some of the rallies have exhibited anti-Semitic sentiments, including a rally at the Sydney Opera House two days after the Hamas attack during which a group of men chanted “f**k the Jews” and “gas the Jews”. Elsewhere in Sydney on Sunday, Jewish Australians gathered at Rodney Reserve in Dover Heights to fly kites in the blue-and-white colours of the Israeli flag to call for the release of the 34 children held hostage by Hamas. Protesters dressed in hazmat suits were kicked out of the NSW Liberal Party conference for calling Opposition Leader Peter Dutton the “MP for Fukushima”. A former Liberal candidate who nearly ousted now NSW Premier Chris Minns from his seat, has been endorsed as the candidate to win back John Howard’s old seat. One of the victims of a pedophile former state MP says he “never got back on track” after being sexually abused as a boy.",
Aus strengthens sanctions against Hamas,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/penny-wong-announces-new-hamas-sanctions-welcomed-by-zionists/news-story/5fd2b102cfddbe36bef43ef31445b478,"Australian Zionists have joined the fray welcoming a raft of new sanctions against Hamas announced by the Albanese government. On Saturday, Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong announced counter-terrorism financial and travel sanctions were being imposed on eight people and one entity in response to Hamas’ October 7 attacks. In a statement, she said the individuals included Hamas members, operatives and financial facilitators, alongside a currency exchange owned by one of the individuals. Counter-terrorism financing sanctions against Hamas in its entirety have been in place since 2001. Senator Wong said taking the additional sanctioning steps demonstrates “that they are actively engaged in the support and facilitation of terrorism”. It is therefore a criminal offence, punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment and heavy fines, to provide assets to the sanctioned individuals or entities, or use or deal with their assets. “These measures enable their activity to be prevented and holds them and those that transact with them directly to account,” Senator Wong said in a statement. The Zionist Federation of Australia welcomed the move on Sunday. President Jeremy Leibler said the government had “put its money where its mouth is”. “Hamas terrorises Israeli civilians and imposes a medieval Islamist dictatorship over the people of Gaza. These sanctions demonstrate the Australian Government’s commitment to fighting terrorism,” he said. “Since the beginning of the current war, the Australian Government has backed Israel’s objective to remove Hamas from Gaza. “This expanded sanctions regime is an important indication that Australia continues to stand with Israel in its just war against Hamas.” The sanctions come as the push for Labor to call for a ceasefire in Gaza intensifies. During the week, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s own branch called on the government to take stronger action to protect Palestinian civilians. The government has strengthened its demands for Israel to abide by the rules of international law, and Australia backed a United Nations Security Resolution calling for the protection of civilian lives, but has stopped short of explicitly demanding a ceasefire. Earlier, the Coalition’s foreign affairs spokesman James Paterson told ABC’s Insiders Israel needed to follow international laws of conflict but the world understood the mission of destroying Hamas was crucial. He said Hamas was denying the people in Gaza of their rights. “They have a right not to be treated by Hamas as human shields. They have a right not to be held as hostages by Hamas,” he said. “It is not just 239 Israelis. Two million Gazans used by Hamas in their conflict. “Hamas has options here, too. The war would end tomorrow if Hamas are he leased the captives. “The war would end tomorrow if the Hamas leadership gave up.” Labor has been slammed for being “out of date” on nuclear energy and having an “obsession” with renewables, just days away from a major climate conference in the Middle East. A major change is coming for dual citizens convicted of terrorism with the government vowing to fix “broken” laws. A leading vape advocate claims China is waging a “reverse opium war” on Australia because of a lack of proper regulation of the black market.",
Tragic find near Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-finds-second-body-of-hostage-near-alshifa-hospital-as-they-discover-noa-marciano-19-who-was-kidnapped-by-hamas/news-story/da3567f2fe3c5730e5b8f651b45bc731,"The IDF has recovered two bodies of hostages kidnapped during the October 7 massacre near the al-Shifa hospital. Israeli troops discovered the body of Corporal Noa Marciano, 19, at “a structure adjacent to” the facility after she was killed by Hamas terrorists. The teenager was serving in the Nahal Oz base when it was overrun by militants. Hamas released footage of the soldier speaking to the camera four days after she was taken hostage. She identified herself and confirmed she was being held captive in the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The horror video then cut to vile images of what the terrorists claimed was Marciano’s dead body. The IDF has now confirmed her body has been found and taken back to Israel, where tests confirmed her identity. It comes after Yehudit Weiss – who the IDF says was taken from her home in Be’eri – was found dead in a structure next to the hospital. The 65-year-old had been identified by forensic examiners and the family has been informed. Israeli military also claimed rifles and rocket-propelled grenades were found in the building. The IDF said: “The national task before our eyes is to locate the missing and return the abducted persons home. “The IDF is operating alongside and in full coordination with the relevant national and security institutions in order to pursue these tasks. “We will not cease from the mission until it will be completed.” The IDF did not provide further details on Weiss’s date or cause of death, The Times of Israel reports. The mum-of-five was abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7. Her husband, Shmulik Weiss, was found murdered in the safe room of their home. Israel has also killed the Hamas monster who spat on and paraded Shani Louk’s naked body through Gaza, her family claims. The mother of the murdered tattoo artist, 22, reportedly told a top rabbi that her daughter’s assailant had been wiped out by Israel’s military. The last time Shani had been seen was when footage emerged of her lifeless half-naked body being dragged through Gaza in a truck as Hamas’s cross-border killing spree still raged on. The claims have not yet been officially confirmed. Earlier this month, the desperate parents of 32 child hostages snatched by Hamas pleaded with the terror group to release them. The petrified youngsters are being held underground in the 311-mile network of tunnels dubbed the Gaza Metro as Israel battles to crush the jihadists and bring them home. It comes as Israeli troops claim to have uncovered laptops containing pictures and videos of hostages at al Shifa Hospital – Gaza’s largest. Dozens of victims were kidnapped by Hamas during the horror October 7 massacre – and haven’t been heard from since. But there is now fresh hope for the captives as Israeli soldiers say they have found photographic evidence of them of al-Shifa hospital. Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told The BBC during a tour of the facility: “We uncovered a lot of computers and other equipment which could really shed light on the current situation, hopefully regarding hostages as well.” He said the devices were found alongside a number of military books and pamphlets the IDF believe suggest Hamas terrorists were there “within the last few days”. Lt Colonel Conricus said a map was also found that appeared to mark entry and exit routes from the hospital. Israel has claimed the hospital is the “beating heart” of Hamas, and this week launched a raid to hunt down terrorists using it as cover. IDF footage showed troops taking in humanitarian as thousands of patients, doctors and displaced Palestinians have been trapped inside the besieged complex for weeks. The IDF also claimed that it had successfully provided incubators, baby food and medical supplies to the hospital. Israel said what is called a “precise and targeted” raid inside al Shifa is a “military necessity” to root out Hamas. This article originally appeared inThe Sunand was reproduced with permission.

Huge weapons haul found in Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hamas-terror-cell-found-inside-mri-suite-at-gaza-hospital-idf-footage-shows-massive-weapons-hoard/news-story/af0903bb5d49bf940a82047a4bf9a439,"Hamas killers behind the Israel terror attack hid a huge weapons cache within the MRI centre of Gaza’s largest hospital. Israeli special forces wearing night vision goggles found their al-Shifa HQ in a dramatic 2am raid. The Israel Defence Force blew off the doors to the hospital and searched the sprawling complex to stop the terror group’s “beating heart”,The Sunreports. Last night, they revealed the devastating arsenal they found hidden among bandages and dressings. They included grab bags containing Kalashnikovs, AK-47s, grenades, body armour with Hamas insignia and ammo. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said troops have been in contact with hospital staff to facilitate the evacuation of patients, who have been used as human shields by Hamas. He explained how terrorists likely managed to escape the hospital without being noticed. “We found uniforms of Hamas terrorists which were thrown on the hospital floor, to allow those terrorists to escape, likely disguised as civilians,” Hagari said. “We warned the hospital management in advance, before our operation. “Today, we also delivered to the hospital medical equipment and baby food.” Fellow Israel Defence Forces spokesman Lt-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said the evidence “totally confirms without a doubt that Hamas systematically uses hospitals in their military operations”. He added: “What we have found is only the tip of the iceberg. These weapons have absolutely no business being inside a hospital. “The only reason they are here is because Hamas put them here and they use this place like many other hospitals for their illicit military purposes.” An IDF spokesman added: “IDF troops are continuing the precise and targeted operation against Hamas in the Shifa Hospital complex, in which the troops are conducting searches for Hamas terrorist infrastructure and assets. “As the soldiers entered the hospital complex, they engaged with a number of terrorists and killed them. “Following this, during searches in one of the departments of the hospital, the troops located a room with technological assets, along with military and combat equipment used by the Hamas terrorist organisation. “In another department in the hospital, the soldiers located an operational command centre and technological assets belonging to Hamas, indicating that the terrorist organisation uses the hospital for terrorist purposes. “The technological assets and extensive intelligence information located was transferred for full review by the relevant authorities. “The IDF is continuing to operate in the hospital complex, while extracting intelligence information and preventing harm to the medical teams and civilians sheltering there.” Gaza’s health ministry denies the claims. A Hamas spokesperson said: “The Israeli occupation’s claim that weapons are being stored at al-Shifa hospital is a blatant lie that should deceive nobody any longer. “The Zionist occupation’s claim that it found weapons and military equipment at al Shifa medical complex is nothing but a continuation of its lies and cheap propaganda.” Troops were given the green light to go into the hospital after US spooks obtained intelligence confirming it was a human shield for its command centre. Hamas fighters hiding underground since the slaying of 1,200 Israelis on October 7 were given a 1am deadline to surrender. An hour later more than 100 commandos — flanked by 30 tanks, countless ground troops and aerial drones — began the battle for al-Shifa. Five Hamas terrorists laying explosive booby traps in the grounds were killed during a gunfight before troops headed to the hospital’s A&E. There, soldiers from Israel Defence Forces burst through the doors yelling in Arabic: “Don’t move, don’t move.” They secured the area and then went from room to room, floor to floor, in search of Hamas fighters, with men aged 16 to 40 ordered into a courtyard and interrogated. Medical teams, patients and women remained inside. In the hours that followed the raid, battery-operated incubators for 36 newborn babies fighting for their lives were delivered by Israeli troops to the hospital. Food and medical supplies were also piled up at the entrance to ease an ongoing humanitarian crisis. Troops remained at the hospital overnight but faced a race against time to locate the entrances to the terror tunnels built below the sprawling site. It is believed some of the 240 hostages snatched by Hamas gunmen are being held there. In a passionate address to the nation, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu vowed: “We will not let up. “There is no place in Gaza that we cannot reach. There are no hideouts. There is no shelter or refuge for the Hamas murderers. “We will reach and eliminate Hamas and we will bring back our hostages.” Their daring mission was given the all-clear after a tense stand-off lasting for days amid growing international pressure. Israel was urged not to start a gunfight in a hospital filled with patients. But shortly before 9.30pm, the White House said the US had its own intelligence proving al-Shifa and other hospitals were Hamas human shields. It said independent evidence showed the healthcare facilities were a front for Hamas terror operations. National security spokesman John Kirby said: “That is a war crime.” But last night, he was forced to deny the US had given Israel the OK to launch its mission. And there was no sign of those held captive, including 38 children, as searches of the compound continued into the night. The long-awaited raid was announced shortly after troops found a mass of weapons beneath the nearby al-Rantisi hospital and signs of hostages. Natalie Thurtle, deputy medical co-ordinator of charity Doctors Without Borders, said at least 300 patients and staff remained inside al-Shifa hospital. She said: “We’ve been trying to evacuate them for three days. It’s very perilous and there is no opportunity for people to leave Shifa at the moment.” This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced with permission.

Sad update on babies at Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/journalists-allowed-inside-alshifa-hospital-as-israels-war-against-hamas-continues/news-story/a0ebf5d58c2bd146ab8dfa8405c1aa30,"International journalists have been given a view inside Gaza’s largest hospital, where newborn babies are among those who have died as a result of the fighting between Israel and Hamas. The BBC was among a group of journalists invited inside al-Shifa hospital by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), and shown evidence that Hamas had been operating inside. There are also indications that some of the hostages abducted by the terrorist group during its attack on October 7 were held there. “We uncovered a lot of computers and other equipment which could really shed light on the current situation, hopefully regarding hostages as well,” an Israeli Lieutenant Colonel, Jonathan Conricus,told the British broadcaster. “At the end of the day, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Hamas aren’t here because they saw we were coming. This is probably what they were forced to leave behind. Our assessment is that there’s much more.” The BBC was shown three stashes of assault rifles, ammunition and bulletproof vests. Fighting continued to rage in Gaza on Thursday, more than five weeks after the unprecedented attack by Hamas on October 7 sparked retaliatory bombing and a ground offensive by Israel, which has vowed to destroy the Palestinian militant group. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Israel during the attack and around 240 people taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. In Gaza, more than 11,500 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed, officials in the Hamas-run territory have said. The Israeli army said on Thursday its troops had taken “operational control” of Gaza City’s port. “In the past few days, in a joint operation, soldiers took operational control of the Gaza harbour, which was controlled by the Hamas terrorist organisation,” the IDF said in a statement. “All buildings in the harbour area were cleared.” The announcement came hours after the Israeli military said it had renewed its military operation at the al-Shifa hospital, Gaza’s largest. The United Nations Security Council managed to agree a resolution on the Israel-Hamas war after multiple attempts, calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses” to allow aid to reach civilians in the besieged territory. The resolution, which passed thanks to abstentions from veto-holders Russia, the United States and Britain, called on all parties to protect civilians, “especially children”. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, condemned the resolution as “disconnected from reality”. The Israeli army on Thursday announced the deaths of three more soldiers in Gaza, raising the number of troops killed in the Palestinian territory to 51 since the start of the war with Hamas. An army spokesman confirmed the new overall toll to AFP, after announcing two soldiers were killed in combat in northern Gaza on Wednesday and raising the toll to 50. It later announced the death of a 22-year-old captain, the 51st casualty since Israel’s ground operation in Gaza began. The toll does not include those killed during Hamas’s attack on southern Israel. In total more than 300 Israeli troops have been killed since October 7. Meanwhile, Israeli police killed three gunmen who attacked a checkpoint in Jerusalem on Thursday and wounded several security force members. Four security personnel suffered gunshot wounds, including one who was critically injured, while two more were lightly injured, according to Israeli emergency services. The checkpoint was guarding road tunnels linking Jerusalem with the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where violence between Israeli settlers and Palestinians has surged since October 7. Raids by Israel’s military, which says it is responding to “a significant rise in terrorist attacks”, have also multiplied in the West Bank where the Palestinian death toll has soared. UN flags serious human rights violations The United Nations’ human rights chief has highlighted allegations of serious rights violations in the Israel-Hamas war that he says need “full accountability”. Volker Turk said “extremely serious allegations of multiple and profound breaches of international humanitarian law, whoever commits them, demand rigorous investigation and full accountability”. The UN high commissioner for human rights did not name Israel or Hamas, but he spoke after a visit last week to the Middle East, where he warned that both sides were committing war crimes in a conflict that has left thousands dead. “Where national authorities prove unwilling or unable to carry out such investigations, and where there are contested narratives on particularly significant incidents, international investigation is called for,” he said in a briefing to UN member states in Geneva. Turk decried the “conflagration of violence (that) has been unleashed”. He said he had spoken to people crossing out of Gaza during a visit to the Egyptian border, and “rarely have I heard such disturbing testimony about the catastrophic harm that ordinary people have endured”. He was unable to access Israel or the Palestinian territories, but stressed Thursday the urgent need for his department to go there, “to ensure full and independent monitoring and documentation, and to co-ordinate protection work”. He told reporters he had “asked Israel to give me access both to Israel, but also to the occupied Palestinian territory. I have not yet received a response”, he said. The Israeli mission to the UN in Geneva later dismissed his request to visit Israel, telling AFP it “did not see any added benefit of the high commissioner’s visit at this time”. During his visit to the region last week, the Israeli mission said Turk had “made it clear that his mind had already been made up, and therefore dialogue with (his office) would contribute little.” West Bank warning During Thursday’s briefing, Turk voiced concern about the “intensification of violence and severe discrimination against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem”. “This creates a potentially explosive situation,” he said. “I am ringing the loudest possible alarm bell about the occupied West Bank.” He urged an immediate ceasefire. “It is apparent that on both sides, some view the killing of civilians as either acceptable collateral damage, or a deliberate and useful weapon of war,” he said. He also insisted that “the Israeli occupation must end”. “Israelis’ freedom is inextricably bound up with Palestinians’ freedom. Palestinians and Israelis are each others’ only hope for peace.” Israel harshly criticised UN attempts to balance criticism about violations, insisting that international law was “not a suicide pact”. If a state cannot defend itself “or is criticised for doing so in line with international law, inevitably terrorist organisations will become more and more emboldened,” Israeli ambassador Meirav Eilon Shahar told the gathering. “There is no moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas. We will not let Israel be delegitimised by misrepresentation of reality,” she said. Palestinian ambassador Ibrahim Khraishi flatly rejected that view. “You should wake up in this room. This is a massacre, this is genocide,” he said, accusing Israel of acting “above the law”. “The problem didn’t start on October 7 — It started 75 years ago,” he said. He received support from other countries, including from Jordan’s representative who insisted that “Israel must halt its aggression”. - with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Ominous pink bag discovered in Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/raise-your-hands-israel-raids-hospital-in-centre-of-gaza-war/news-story/d2f2ea61d6339efc073b19f0dc462018,"An ominous pink bag found in a “secluded” section of Gaza’s largest hospital is proof Hamas soldiers were hiding inside, Israel claims. Israeli forces stormed the Al-Shifa hospital in a major pre-dawn raid Wednesday, claiming to have found military equipment including weapons. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza has denied the claims, saying Israeli forces “did not find any equipment or weapons in the hospital”. A journalist at the site told AFP they carried out room-by-room searches after days of fighting on the outskirts of the facility with Hamas militants. In a seven-minute video posted to X on Thursday, Lt. Colonel Jonathan Conricus from Israeli Defence Force (IDF) toured the hospital, showing what he claimed to be evidence of Hamas’ use of hospitals in their military operation. “What we have found, I think, is only the tip of the iceberg,” he said. During the “one shot” video, Lt. Conricus showed guns, ammunition, grenades and miliary equipment which had been left in the MRI department of the hospital. In one section of the hospital, Lt. Conricus revealed a pink “grab bag” that was left on top of a “spare part”. He claimed the bag, which had been emptied by the IDF, contained “a full military kit for one Hamas terrorist”. After holding up the empty bag, the camera panned to its laid-out contents, which included a grenade, fighting vest, ammunition, boots, uniforms and an AK-47 gun. “In the hospital, we found weapons, intelligence materials, and military technology and equipment,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters. “We also found an operational headquarters with comms equipment … belonging to Hamas” and “Hamas uniforms”, he said. The army earlier published images of what it said were guns, grenades and other equipment found at the hospital. AFP was unable to independently verify the images. Rear Admiral Hargari said troops found Hamas uniforms “that were thrown on the hospital floor so that the terrorists could escape in civilian guise.” “These findings unequivocally prove that the hospital was used for terror, in complete violation of international law,” he said. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has repeatedly denied claims the hospital was doubling up as a command centre for the terrorist group. “Essentially we don’t allow” weapons in any hospital, said health ministry director Munir al-Bursh in a statement. The ministry said Israeli soldiers destroyed medical equipment which is not available elsewhere in Gaza and detained two engineers who worked on the hospital’s oxygen and power supplies. The United Nations estimates there are at least 2,300 patients, staff and displaced Palestinians inside Al-Shifa. Global agencies including the World Health Organization and the International Committee of the Red Cross raised concerns for the safety of patients and medical staff following the Israeli raid. Hours after Israeli troops launched a night-time raid on the hospital, soldiers interrogated patients in the compound’s courtyard while other Palestinians stood stripped to their underwear. “All men 16 years and above, raise your hands,” a soldier shouted in accented Arabic through a loudspeaker at those sheltering inside Al-Shifa hospital, which has been at the centre of fierce urban combat for days. “Exit the building towards the courtyard and surrender,” the soldier ordered, according to a journalist who visited the embattled hospital several days ago for interviews and was trapped inside because of the fighting outside. About 1000 male Palestinians, their hands above their heads, were soon led into the vast hospital courtyard, some of them stripped naked by Israeli soldiers checking them for weapons or explosives, the journalist told AFP. Hours later, some 200 remained in their underwear, forced to stand beside tanks used in the military incursion into the medical facility. The army labelled the raid a “precise and targeted” operation against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that launched the deadly October 7 attacks on southern Israel. Israel withdrew its troops and vehicles on Wednesday evening, the journalist told AFP, repositioning them outside the hospital walls. “Before entering the hospital, our forces encountered explosive devices and terrorist squads, and fighting commenced in which terrorists were killed,” the military said of the battle preceding the raid. Witnesses have described conditions inside the hospital as horrific, with medical procedures performed without anaesthetic, families with scant food or water living in corridors, and the stench of decomposing corpses filling the air. As Israeli forces raced through the corridors, hundreds of young men emerged from different wards, including the maternity section, which was hit in a strike a few days ago, the journalist reported. Soldiers fired warning shots as they moved from room to room looking for Hamas militants, he said, adding the troops were also searching women and children, some of whom were in tears. Tanks in hospital complex Hamas in its October 7 attack, the worst in Israel’s history, killed about 1200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 240 hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli officials. In Gaza, more than 11,300 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground invasion since, health officials in the Hamas-run territory have said. In the hospital incursion, the journalist said Israeli troops entered the main emergency department and other wards. The Israeli army, in a statement early Wednesday, said they were targeting Hamas “in a specified area” of the facility. Soldiers were still questioning wounded people and their companions on Wednesday afternoon, as they moved between hospital departments, the journalist at Al-Shifa said. The army said it had delivered incubators, baby food and medical supplies to the hospital, which AFP was not able to verify. The journalist said soldiers were handing out drinking water to some of the displaced people who had taken shelter at the hospital during weeks of warfare. “Our medical teams and Arabic speaking soldiers are on the ground to ensure that these supplies reach those in need,” the army said. Gaza’s Hamas government accused the Israeli army of committing a “war crime and crime against humanity”. Over the past few days Israel has encircled Al-Shifa in north Gaza, charging that tunnels under the facility were being used as hideouts by Hamas commanders. The White House said that US intelligence sources corroborated Israel’s claim that Hamas and another militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, had buried an operational “command and control node” under Al-Shifa. Hamas has denied those charges and stressed the suffering inside the besieged facility that, like other hospitals, has been without electricity or fuel for generators amid the Israeli siege of the Palestinian territory. The United Nations said earlier that at least 2,300 people — patients, staff and displaced civilians — were inside and may be unable to escape because of the fierce fighting. Citing the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, UN humanitarian agency OCHA said 40 patients had died in Al-Shifa on Tuesday. The hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya said that 179 bodies had been buried in a mass grave inside the complex. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Dutton explodes over Albo’s overseas trip,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/politics/cyber-attacks-are-on-the-rise-in-australia-according-to-bombshell-new-report/news-story/1e8f9487fc9c62c54f93983bbc4f7305,"Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has exploded over the Prime Minister’s trip to the United States and questioned his leadership over the rise of anti-Semitism in Australia. In a wide-ranging speech during question time, Mr Dutton asked the house to express its concern about the rise of anti-Semitism and social disharmony, to condemn the Prime Minister’s lack of “strong leadership”. “Prime Minister, I have written to you and what you should do is consult with the premiers and the chief ministers and immediately convene a meeting of the national cabinet to get a better understanding of the police response, to understand what the security and intelligence agencies are providing, to collate that information, and to have a coherent response which provides support and underpinning a security for people of Jewish faith in this country when they need it most – in their hour of need,” he said. “This Prime Minister has gone missing.” Mr Dutton said since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the Albanese government had failed to stand up for the Jewish community and was “speaking out both sides of its mouth”. “The Australian public sees this as a government where the wheels are quickly falling off,” Mr Dutton said. “It’s given rise to social disharmony in this country. There are Jewish kids who are afraid to go to school.” Mr Albanese said government’s words “have been qualified, the message divided”. But straight after question time, the Prime Minister left for his trip to San Francisco for the APEC summit. “Australia’s participation at the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting signals our enduring commitment to strengthening regional economic cooperation and growth,” he said ahead of the trip. “This year’s theme focuses on resiliency, sustainability and inclusion – all key priorities of the Australian government. “Engagement with APEC partners is critical for seizing the opportunities to create the jobs of the future, to expand our economic growth, and to take advantage of our location – on the doorstep of the fastest growing region in human history.” Albanese slams Dutton over QT comments Mr Albanese slammed Mr Dutton for the “weaponisation of anti-Semitism” in parliament. Mr Albanese said it was “frankly beyond contempt” that Mr Dutton would seek to link anti-Semitism with the decision of the High Court. The Prime Minister said he would continue to stand up against anti-Semitism, and he remains “proud” of his track record of advocating for a two-state solution. “I make no apologies for trying to bring communities together, not divide them. Because that’s the role of political leaders,” he said. “At a time where there is social division, leaders have a choice – to either bring people together or divide them.” Mr Albanese said Mr Dutton had been “exposed for all to see” for going so low as to link the two issues. Mr Albanese said he understood how fearful Jewish Australians and Arab-Australians and Islamic Australians all were at the moment, and said “no one should threaten people because of their religion or their race”. Mr Albanese went on to offer some of his strongest language yet on the unfolding crisis in the Middle East. “We have responsibilities as a democratic nation to say that democratic nations must stand up, consistent with the international rule of law,” Mr Albanese said. “That is something that I have done and will consistently do.” Later on Wednesday, Wentworth MP Allegra Spender also denounced Mr Dutton for “turning antisemitism into a political football” saying it was damaging not only for the Jewish community but for national cohesion. “To watch the Opposition deliberately try and politicise this issue and conflate it with the Prime Minister’s travel schedule in order to score political points is disgraceful,” she sad in a statement after question time. “We need to come together as a country and take urgent action against anti-Semitism and all forms of hate speech. “This is a time when Australia’s national unity has never been more important. Peter Dutton’s attempt to weaponise and politicise anti-Semitism for political gain is unconscionable.” Dutton raises questions over ‘hard-core’ criminals Mr Dutton then moved to ask the house to express its concerns about threats to community safety in the wake of last week’s High Court decision, and the presence of “hard core criminals” including murderers, rapists, and paedophiles among that cohort. He called on Mr Albanese to “cancel his plans to travel to the United States”, because his priority “must be the protection of the Australian community at home”. He doubled down his calls for Mr Albanese to urgently convene a national cabinet meeting to “formulate a strong and coherent response to combat the rise of anti-Semitism, repair social cohesion, and protect community safety”. Mr Dutton said the government should urgently bring forward any legislation necessary to “neutralise the threat posed by the hard core criminals his government has released into the Australian community”. He said the parliament should sit for as long as is necessary until that legislation is dealt with. The government is adamant every one of the asylum seekers and refugees released from indefinite detention after last week’s High Court decision is on an appropriate visa with conditions. Immigration Minister Andrew Giles faced questioning from Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and Dan Tehan in question time on Wednesday. It followed reports from the ABC that revealed some of the detainees released in recent days were in the community without visas. Mr Giles said there were now 83 people who had been released from detention after the decision, and reiterated that it was not the federal government’s desire to have them in the community. “Complying with the orders of the court is not optional,” he said. “We have to give effect to the decision that was made and all of those 83 releases required by the decision of the court are people who are on bridging visas, with appropriate conditions.” Government signals new legislation following High Court ruling Senator Wong has confirmed emergency legislation will be introduced to respond to the High Court ruling that indefinite detention is unlawful. “The government is working through that and, as I said, the government intends to introduce legislation shortly to further respond to the decision of the High Court and we look forward to the opposition assisting with passage of that legislation as soon as possible,” she said. Wong fires up over the Greens questioning A fired up Penny Wong unleashed on a Greens senator for seeking answers about Australia’s defence exports to Israel. David Shoebridge asked the Foreign Minister during question time on Wednesday whether Australia was supplying parts for F-35 fighter jets, or other weapons, to the Jewish state. Senator Wong insisted the government had not supplied weapons to Israel since the conflict with Hamas began. But after a clash between the two, the Foreign Minister lost her cool, drawing a line between the questioning and misinformation on social media. “You are trying to make this a political issue,” she shouted, pointing her finger at the Greens. “It is utterly irresponsible” On Tuesday, Mr Albanese told Labor MPs social media posts that suggested Australia was supplying weapons to Israel was not true. Australia’s cyber boss ‘recalled’ to defence The senior Australian Air Force officer recently appointed to the country’s top cybersecurity role has been recalled to defence to deal with a “workplace matter”. In a statement, the Australian Defence Force said Air Marshal Darren Goldie, who was appointed the inaugural national cyber security co-ordinator in July, had “been recalled to defence to deal with a workplace matter related to his time in defence”. “He is currently on leave. While the matter is under consideration it would be inappropriate to comment further,” the statement said. “The welfare of our people remains our priority and it is requested that Air Marshal Goldie’s privacy is respected at this time.” Home Affairs and Cyber Security Minister Clare O’Neil said she had been notified of Air Marshal Goldie’s recall. She said Department of Home Affairs deputy secretary of cyber and infrastructure security Hamish Hansford would act as national cyber security co-ordinator in the interim. Air Marshal Goldie had, in recent weeks, taken the lead on the country’s cybersecurity responses to Optus’s nationwide shutdown and the DP World cyber attack that forced ports across Australia to close. Dutton’s national cabinet call for Albo Peter Dutton has called on Anthony Albanese to urgently convene a national cabinet meeting to deal with the ongoing domestic implications of the Israel-Hamas war. The Opposition Leader told reporters on Wednesday that he wrote to the Prime Minister to voice his concerns about rising anti-Semitism across Australia. Mr Dutton said Mr Albanese and state and territory leaders should urgently meet to discuss their joint response to increased reports of anti-social behaviour. “I fear that there will be a significant act within our community that will cause harm to people in the Jewish community, or the community (more broadly),” the Liberal leader said. “At a time when temperatures are rising, the Prime Minister should be showing strong leadership to lower those temperatures. He has completely failed that test.” Mr Dutton said it was time for the government to “show resolve” and speak with “one united voice against anti-Semitism”. “That’s the view of not just the Opposition but of many Jewish leaders within this community.” Albanese ‘shouldn’t leave country’ Mr Dutton said Mr Albanese “should not go to APEC” to deal with the fallout of the High Court’s decision last week that indefinite immigration detention is illegal. About 80 people have been freed since last week’s ruling, including some people known to be convicted criminals. Mr Dutton and the Coalition have slammed the government for failing to plan for the outcome and now want legislation to be rushed through the parliament to deal with the decision. Mr Albanese will head to San Francisco on Wednesday afternoon for the economic forum, meaning he will miss the last sitting day of the week. Mr Dutton said he shouldn’t go and parliament “should not rise” until the government comes forward with legislation “We will sit down with the government, we will sit additional hours through the night, whatever it takes to get these people back into custody, which is where they belong,” Mr Dutton said. “It is the No. 1 priority of any government to keep the community safe. The government is failing, (Mr Albanese) has been asleep at the wheel and continues to be asleep at the wheel on this issue.” Ahead of question time on Thursday, Greens Senator Nick McKim urged Labor to not let any legislative fix be “dictated” by Mr Dutton because he had a “horrendous record of cruelty to refugees and disregarding basic human rights.” Silence over Gaza The Greens will ask the Senate to hold a minute’s silence after proceedings on Wednesday afternoon in respect to civilian lives lost in Gaza. It follows weeks of political divisions over the government’s response to the conflict. Greens foreign affairs spokesman Jordon Steele-John said all major parties should join the minor party to call for a ceasefire. “Children and families have faced horrific death, injury and suffering. People in Gaza are experiencing relentless bombing. Those that survive the bombing have increasingly limited access to electricity, food or water,” he said in a statement. “This cannot go on.” The Albanese government has stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, with Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong saying on Sunday, “We all want to take the next steps towards a ceasefire.” Earlier this morning, The Israeli Defence Forces posted on X that it was “carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital” after it accused the terrorist group of having a command post under the complex. Thousands of civilians, including 600 patients, are reportedly sheltering at the hospital according to reports from British broadcaster Channel 4. High Court move unleashes concern Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said the federal government was “deeply concerned” over the release of individuals convicted of murder and child sexual abuse into the community. Mr Marles said the government was doing everything in its power to closely monitor individuals who have been deemed as dangerous and flagged that a full briefing on the decision had yet to be released by the top court. “Obviously, we were in the High Court arguing against this decision so we are deeply concerned about the consequences of it which is why we’ve put those people who have been released on bridging visas which contain the strongest possible conditions on them, and we are now looking at every options available to around what more we can do, but bear in mind the full judgment hasn’t been released yet,” Mr Marles told Sky. “We want to make sure the steps we take are legally robust.” Major cyber warning China has been named the main actor of state-sponsored cyber attacks against Australia amid warnings of a nationwide surge in cybercrime. An annual cyber threat report released on Tuesday revealed 94,000 cyber incidents had been reported over the past financial year, with the cost of attacks on small businesses rising on average to $46,000. The report flagged that attacks on federal government agencies and critical infrastructure have also increased, with state-sponsored cyber hacks pinned as a serious concern. Chinese state-backed hackers were identified as a leading culprit of cyber warfare, alongside Russia and Iran. Foreign cyber actors are increasingly crippling local businesses, the report said, with the most common form of attack being “compromised emails” where a scammer uses email to trick someone into sending money or divulging confidential company information. Individuals are the most vulnerable to identify fraud, online banking fraud, and online shopping fraud. Mr Marles said cyber warfare was a critical issue raised with during recent conversations with China. “We are making sure we have the best possible defence in place and there’s a range of other state actors who have been engaged in this as well,” he said. Christmas trade relief on the cards China’s trade block on Australian, beef, lobster and wine could be lifted by Christmas according to the trade minister. Don Farrell spoke ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Wentao on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in San Francisco. “Issues in respect to lobster and to beef are biosecurity issues, but I remain very confident based on my meeting last week, and hopefully my meeting today, that by Christmas all of these trade impediments will be removed,” Mr Farrell told ABC RN. China imposed sanctions worth $20bn on Australian products during the height of diplomatic tensions in 2020. Only $2bn worth of sanctions remain on Australian exports, including rock lobsters and beef. “China has its processes to go through and we understand that – we are simply encouraging them to complete those processes.” Government must ‘wake up’ on toxic dust Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie wants to know if the federal government will wait and hold a sausage sizzle before it bans the import and manufacture of a toxic concrete linked to incurable lung disease. The government is under pressure to ban engineered stone, which is linked to silicosis, after major retailers phased out a range of products in response to a damning safety report. Swedish furniture giant Ikea announced it would follow in Bunnings’ footsteps to phase out range of trendy kitchen benchtops from its shelves in the wake of a Safe Work Australia report that recommended an outright ban on the material to protect another generation of workers from fatal illness. Independent crossbenchers and MPs penned an open letter to state and federal workplace ministers on Wednesday urging for a nationwide ban on the material. “It’s really embarrassing when you have Bunnings that’s already come over the top of you. Wake up and do something that is sensible that saves lives in this country and do it before Christmas,” Senator Lambie told reporters.

Cops probe confronting scene at MP offices,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/propalestine-protesters-leave-fake-bodies-outside-politicians-offices-across-melbourne/news-story/a241cfeb94a5f945c7bd38c190ce364c,"Police are investigating after fake bodies wrapped in bloodied white bags were left outside politicians offices across Melbourne as a part of pro-Palestine protests. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, NDIS Minister Bill Shorten, and a number of other federal MPs including Ged Kearney and Andrew Giles were targeted by the protests. Child-sized dolls were also seen covered in red paint on the sidewalk, with up to 14 of effigies left at each office. The fake bodies were accompanied by several signs that read “Free Palestine”, “End the occupation” and “No more bodies in Gaza”. Police have confirmed to NCA Newswire that they are investigating, with effigies left in Moonee Ponds, Heidelberg, Geelong, Preston, Thomastown and Coburg. “Anyone who witnessed the incidents, has dashcam/CCTV footage or information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000,” a Victoria Police spokesperson said. Protest group No More Bodies in Gaza claimed responsibility for the act, taking to Instagram to condemn Labor MPs who they say are remaining silent “in the face of the mounting atrocities” despite expressing support for Palestine in the past. “The bodies we have laid at the offices of the parliamentarians are equal to the number of Palestinian deaths per hour in Gaza,” the group wrote on social media. “These deaths are not just numbers – these were living, breathing human beings with families and aspirations, who were murdered by the genocidal settler project of Israel. “A ceasefire alone will not end the occupation, and without an end, the cycle of violence will continue as it has done for the last 75 years.” Its understood that police officers have now removed the bodies from outside the offices. NCA Newswire has contacted Victoria Police for comment. Some of those who saw the fake bodies before they were taken away described it as horrifying. “I can’t tell you how horrified I was...its concerning because small children are going to see that, teenagers are going to see that,” a witness told 3AW. “Even I as a 53-year-old found it disgusting and confronting.” Anti-Defamation Commission chair, Dvir Abramovich feared the incident would “only increase tensions. “Something very wrong is happening in country,” said Dr Abramovich. “I am very worried that this tsunami of extremism and street warfare, that will shock the conscience of every Australian, will end in tragedy.” No More Bodies in Gaza has vowed to continue its protest actions and rallies along with a letter writing and phone call campaign until the federal government responds to their requests. Tensions are high in Australia as Israel continues to bombard Gaza in response to a Hamas terror attack on October 7 which killed 1200 Israelis. The bombings in Gaza have killed more than 10,000, the majority of whom are children. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Israel storms Gaza’s largest hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israeli-defence-force-begins-military-operation-against-gazas-largest-hospital-satellite-pics-show-tanks-amassed-outside/news-story/58613a81a262b1daf5d793b490cfce0d,"Israeli tanks are poised outside Gaza’s largest hospital with reports the military has already entered some buildings. Satellite photos taken in the past few hours reveal the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) has amassed a formation of tanks and armoured vehicles around the perimeter of Dar Al-Shifa Hospital, which is the largest medical complex and emergency hospital in the Gaza Strip. Israel claims the hospital is also the command post for the Palestinian Hamas’ terrorist wing, hidden underground beneath thousands of ailing and sheltering civilians. Further assemblies of tanks and armour can be seen within rubble fortifications bulldozed into the suburbs a few hundred metres from the hospital. The director of the Al Shifa Hospital has told Palestinian media that his staff and patients are attempting to shelter in hallways with the sound of heavy gunfire coming from the streets outside. Palestinian health minister Mai Al-Kaila accused Israel of committing “crimes against humanity” at the hospital. Reports from inside say staff and patients have been told to take cover and stay away from windows, while medical procedures are taking place without anaesthetic. “There are bodies littered in the hospital complex and there is no longer electricity at the morgues,” said hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya. “We were forced to bury them in a mass grave,” he added, estimating that 179 bodies had been interred so far, including seven newborns who died when their incubators lost power. After warnings from the United States and others that the Al-Shifa hospital must be protected, the IDF said in the early hours that they had entered the compound in Gaza City. “Based on intelligence information and an operational necessity, IDF forces are carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital,” the military said in a statement. The United Nations estimates that at least 2,300 patients, staff and displaced civilians are inside the facility, trapped by days of fierce fighting and aerial bombardments. Ongoing attempts to evacuate the hospital have been abandoned amid heavy fighting in the surrounding suburbs. “The occupation (IDF) officially informed us of its intention to storm the Shifa complex in the coming minutes,” a Ministry of Health in Gaza statement adds. Subsequent reports say tanks have since forced their way through to the hospital’s main courtyard - where many refugees are camped - as commandos stormed the hospital from multiple directions. Israel’s ultimatum A spokesman for the Israeli government confirmed it had made an ultimatum. “The IDF calls on Hamas terrorists hiding under Shifa Hospital to surrender,” says Eylon Levy. “We have given enough warning. Its protected status under international law has lapsed, and we are fully within our rights to counter Hamas’ belligerent military activities.” The military says its attack complies with the laws of war. “That’s what we’re doing by sending our forces in with specially trained medical teams and Arabic speakers, after trying to facilitate an evacuation for A MONTH and giving Hamas time to surrender. We know what our obligations are. We know our rights.” In a later statement on X, Mr Levy said the IDF would “destroy all of Hamas’ terror and governing infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.” “Our duty of self defense means eliminating the terror group that did that, so that it can never perpetrate the same atrocities again.” Israel’s surgical strikes The hospital has been under siege for four days, with no electricity or water supplies getting through to its patients. Its last stocks of medical supplies reportedly ran out after attempts to deliver fresh supplies were halted due to the bombing of an ambulance convoy. The US Pentagon came out overnight supporting Israel’s allegations. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told media that “a variety of intelligence sourcing” had confirmed “Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad used some hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them, to conceal and support their military operations and to hold hostages.” He called such use of hospitals “a war crime.” “If true, this would endanger civilians and violate the laws of war,” Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “It would not, however, give the Israeli military free rein to do anything it wanted against the hospital.” Israel has been calling for Gaza City hospitals to shut down and evacuate for several weeks. But the bombing of ambulances and medical convoys, along with ongoing fighting in the streets, has led many medical personnel to refuse to do so. The IDF has denied being responsible for a series of projectile hits on the hospital in recent days. But the heavy use of tank artillery and large but low precision 500kg and 1-tonne bombs has significantly increased the risk of “collateral damage” in built-up areas. Appeal for sanctuary The outcome of the battle for Dar Al-Shifa Hospital will be crucial in the campaign against Hamas terrorists, but also for Israel’s standing as a participant in a rules-based world order. The Geneva Conventions, created after the horrors of World War II, the Nazi Holocaust and Imperial Japan’s brutality against military and civilians alike, established hospitals as sanctuaries of the highest order. And that the safety of patients over-rules all other considerations. Israel committed its professional fighting force, the IDF, to the authority of the Geneva Conventions in 1951, after the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. Hamas militants are members of a proscribed terrorist organisation because it has been found to deliberately target civilians to reach its political and military objectives. “We do not want to see a firefight in a hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people are simply trying to get the medical care that they deserve,” Kirby said after supporting Israel’s allegations. “As we have been clear on multiple occasions, Hamas’s actions do not lessen Israel’s responsibilities to protect civilians in Gaza.” The WHO’s Ghebreyesus said in a statement that his organisation had managed to contact health practitioners in the facility yesterday. “Regrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore,” he said. He claimed hospitals can be assaulted if they are demonstrably being used to “commit acts harmful to the enemy”. But, even then, only the highest standards - similar to those aimed at preventing police from shooting hostages to kill a hostage-taker - must be enforced. Laws of war Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) analyst Nathan Ruser says it is the role of professional armies to “take on risk to protect civilians”. “It’s abundantly clear that to the IDF, there’s no civilian price too high to pay for anything that even slightly reduces risk for any IDF soldier,” he tweeted this morning. “This is inherently a massive problem and is leading to immeasurable civilian suffering and death.” WHO’s Ghebreyesus stresses the importance of a “clear warning” before a major attack. “Such warnings should be clear and cannot be issued for the purpose of disrupting the functioning of the hospital or forcing an evacuation.” “There is no reliably safe route to evacuate,” says Ghebreyesus. “Satellite imagery confirms fires, military operations, and roadblocks on every conceivable route. And many sick and injured people in the hospital wouldn’t be able to evacuate even if the roads were clear.” And he says Hamas’ illegal behaviour does not entitle Israel to the same behaviour. “The most critical legal point right now: people unable to leave the hospital still have protections under the laws of war against indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks.” Ruser says the Hamas terrorist group has undeniably built up an infrastructure network exploiting Gazan civilians as human shields. And this is a clear war crime. “That makes any operation into Gaza inherently challenging,” he adds, “but the approach of utterly disregarding civilian collateral damage in Gaza by the IDF is absolutely condemnable.” But Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu says it’s not his fault. “It is Hamas not Israel that should be held accountable for committing a double war crime - targeting civilians while hiding behind civilians,” he said in a statement released about 11am AEDT. “The forces of civilization must back Israel in defeating Hamas barbarism.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Rival caught up in jumping castle furore,https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/jumping-castle-business-slammed-as-antisemitic-after-refusing-jewish-schools-request/news-story/f4175d99e6bd16b6b1651acfd373356b,"A Sydney jumping castle business could face legal action over their public rejection of a request from a Jewish school, with the company owner saying she wouldn’t accept “blood money”. Police officers visited Masada College in St Ives on Wednesday morning as news broke that the school had been blasted on social media by the owner of Western Sydney Jump. She took to the business’s Instagram page on Tuesday to share her response to a request from the school to rent outdoor games for a school function this Friday. “There is no way I am taking a Zionist booking,” the company replied to the Masada principal’s email. “I don’t want your blood money. Free Palestine.” NSW Police told NCA NewsWire that while no official complaint had been made over the incident, officers were attending the St Ives school to conduct inquiries. After her initial post, the owner asserted her “right to decline any booking” before issuing a long post on the conflict in Gaza. “Just to be clear, this is about Zionists. Not Jews. I have zero issue with the Jewish community,” she continued. “You know what actually blows my mind … when Palestinians chant ‘From the river to the sea. Palestine will be free!’ you find Zionists crying and saying ‘Look, they want us all dead’. “But when Zionists actually say ‘flatten Gaza’, or ‘give them hell’, or ‘there should be no limit to the number of civilian casualties in Palestine’, they say nothing. “Like one side is ACTUALLY asking for a genocide with words that describe genocide. And the other is asking for freedom and somehow they put those asking for freedom at fault.” Western Sydney Jump has removed its Instagram page in the fallout from the incident. The controversy has also resulted in a rival company operating under the name Jumping Castles Western Sydney to be misidentified and abused on social media. On Tuesday afternoon, the owner, Rebecca, shared a statement stating her business supported “all cultures to love one another”. “Unfortunately, we have been defamed, abused, threatened by the actions of another company’s actions,” she said. “Our family business does not condone discrimination nor do we agree with what has occurred.” The response from Western Sydney Jump has been met with fury by Jewish groups and prominent Australians, with NSW Premier Chris Minns slamming the business owner. “This is outrageous. It’s not in keeping with any part of our multicultural community. I condemn it completely,” Mr Minns said. The conflict was described as “indicative of the surge in anti-Semitism” in Australia, according to Executive Council of Australian Jewry chief executive Alex Ryvchin. “To refuse to hire a jumping castle to kids who happen to be Jewish is the height of prejudice and low bigotry. The business should be ashamed,” he said. “The reference to blood money of course invokes the blood libel, a classic anti-Jewish myth. “The openness of the racism shows how normalised anti-Jewish hate is becoming.” NSW Health Minister Ryan Park said the messages were “appalling, despicable and disgraceful”. “I can’t condemn them any more than that. They have no place in a modern Australia,” he said. “I find those comments, not only offensive, but highly racist. They should be called out for what they are.” He also called on the sender to apologise, and said it was the “last thing” needed in the community, “particularly given the challenges we see overseas every day”. A finance expert has urged Australians to be prepared for interest rates to rise again in the near future, as the country battles a worsening cost of living crisis. A small fashion brand has hit out at an Aussie giant, accusing it of copying their designs – the same week its founders bought a fourth multimillion-dollar property. Angry customers have hit out at ANZ, accusing the bank of deliberately making it difficult for them to access their own money and “interrogating” them about why they want it.",
Secret Hamas lair found under hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-claims-to-have-uncovered-secret-hamas-lair-underneath-childrens-hospital/news-story/8db4abbcc6b0e99f659a44dbb5ec7227,"The Israeli military claims to have discovered a Hamas lair in the basement of a children’s hospital in the Gaza Strip. In video footage posted by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on social media, spokesman Daniel Hagari uncovers an underground tunnel, located outside a building he identifies as the house of a Hamas militant. The tunnel leads underneath the nearby al-Rentisi hospital. As the video continues, Admiral Hagari explores the basement of the hospital, and highlights a room full of military gear. “I want to show you a room where we found all the gear, the operational gear of Hamas,” Admiral Hagari says. “Look at what Hamas is holding inside the hospital.” “I want you to understand: this kind of gear is the gear for a major fight. These are explosives. These are vests with explosives. It’s a body vest for terrorists to explode on forces, among hospitals, among patients,” says Admiral Hagari. “We have hand grenades, Kalashnikovs (assault rifles), and then we have the RPGs. People shooting RPGs from hospitals. This is Hamas, firing RPGs from hospitals. The world has to understand who Israel is fighting against.” The video then proceeds deeper into the basement of the hospital, where Admiral Hagari says Israeli forces found a motorcycle used in the attack on October 7. “They came back from the massacre on the seventh of October, into al-Rentisi hospital, with hostages on a motorcycle,” he said. “This is a suspicion for an area where hostages were being held.” The area in the footage also includes a chair with a rope next to it. A baby’s bottle is visible on top of an electricity breaker, labelled with the words “World Health Organisation”. There is also a bathroom, which Admiral Hagari again cites as proof that hostages were kept there. “You don’t need to build, improvisedly, in a hospital in the basement, unless you want to hold someone there and you don’t want anyone to see,” he says. Fighting continued to rage in Gaza on Tuesday, local time, more than five weeks after Hamas’s shock October 7 attack sparked a furious response from Israel, which has vowed to destroy the Palestinian militant group. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Israel and around 240 hostages taken, according to Israeli officials. In Gaza, more than 11,200 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed, according to the healthy ministry, which is under Hamas’s control. At least 179 people, including babies and patients who died in the intensive care unit, were buried in a “mass grave” at Gaza’s biggest hospital, said director Mohammad Abu Salmiya. Seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those buried after hospital fuel supplies ran out at the compound, which is caught in intense fighting between Israel and Hamas. Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as hideouts, a charge the militant group has denied and AFP cannot independently verify – the video mentioned above is among the evidence Israel has cited. US President Joe Biden urged Israel on Monday to protect Gaza’s main hospital as heavy fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas raged around the complex. “It’s my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital,” Mr Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if he had expressed concerns to Israel on the issue. “The hospital must be protected.” Israel was facing mounting international pressure over the human cost of its war with Gaza’s Hamas rulers but was working to expand its “window of legitimacy”, its top diplomat said Monday. “We have two or three weeks until international pressure really steps up but the foreign ministry is working to broaden the window of legitimacy, and the fighting will carry on for as long as necessary,” Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said, as quoted by his spokesman. As Israel’s ground campaign advanced, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas had “lost control” of Gaza. “Terrorists are fleeing southward. Civilians are looting Hamas bases,” he said on Israeli television, without providing evidence for the claim. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned on Monday its Gaza operations might shut down due to fuel shortages. “The humanitarian operation in Gaza will grind to a halt in the next 48 hours as no fuel is allowed to enter,” UNRWA’s Gaza chief Thomas White wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Gaza has been under near-total Israeli siege and is short of food, fuel and other basic supplies. – with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

‘Deep breaths’: Warning ahead of Q+A,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/abc-cancels-live-studio-audience-for-discussion-on-israel-conflict/news-story/2caa3b51267ff79c115bb34f728afb58,"The ABC made the decision to not allow a live studio audience for Monday night’s Q+A program, as panellists engaged in tense discussions over the escalating Israeli-Hamas war. Host Patricia Karvelas made the announcement at the beginning of the episode, acknowledging the “difficult and sensitive discussion” about to take place by the panel. It is the first time a live audience has been cancelled after in-person participation was waved during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. However the program’s track record for controversy when it comes to global conflict discussion may have factored into the cancellation. Last year, a Russian-Australian university student was ejected from the audience after professing his support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Stan Grant kicked out Sasha Gilles-Lekakis after he went off script from his proposed question, and accused the Ukrainian Government of collaborating with “Nazi groups (besieging) Russian populations in the Donbas, killing an estimated 13,000 people”. However the most notable scandal came years earlier in 2010 when former prime minister John Howard had a pair of shoes thrown at him over his response to the Iraq War. The shoe-thrower, environmental activist Peter Grey, was kicked out of the live audience and became the subject of widespread criticism from both sides of government. He died only six months later from cancer and had his shoes famously auctioned off for charity, with the $3560 winning bid going towards Red Cross initiatives in Iraq. Concerns for this week’s Monday night program led to a“very significant police contingent” being stationed outside the ABC Melbourne studio. “We believe in your right to ask questions and that is a right we will always defend. Tonight our panellists will hear your questions through video link as we explore an issue rocking our diaspora Jewish and Arab communities,” she said. “We will conduct a robust, healthy and respectful debate.” At one stage, the debate became extremely tense, with Karvelas calling for calm. “Deep breaths, deep breaths and I hope the country is having one, too,” she said. The panel included Assistant Foreign Affairs Minister Tim Watts, former Australian ambassador to Israel and Dave Sharma, Australia Palestine Advocacy Network head Nasser Mashni, lawyer and national chair of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council Mark Leibler, and United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese. The discussion was largely civil, but became tense on several occasions as Mr Leibler and Mr Mashni clashed over points including protests being held in Australia. Protest chant dubbed ‘racist comment’ The panel was also asked if the popular chant heard at pro-Palestine rallies: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” actually called to “eradicate Israel”. Mr Leibler said the saying was a “racist comment,” and implied there was “no room for a state of Israel”. He accused pro-Palestine protests of celebrating violence, however his comments were immediately criticised by Mr Mashni and Ms Albanese. “This is not something in line with Jewish tradition. What do the Palestinians do? Whether it’s 9/11 or October 7, they hand out lollies and they celebrate when people are hacked to death. I don’t know. It is a fact. It is reality,” he said. Mr Mashni said Mr Leibler was “besmirching our entire people”. “We are killed, we’re blamed, we’re smeared,” he said. “What we have is 75 years of oppression, 75 years of denial. Palestinians are human beings, too. We have rights like everybody else to live in peace and sanctity.” Ms Albanese said Mr Mashni’s comments were “inappropriate and disrespectful”. “Speaking of what Hamas has done – war crimes … I’ve condemned that as such,” he said. “When it comes to the killing of Palestinians … these are war crimes and to an extent under international law, this may amount to crimes against humanity because so is the intentional starvation and intentional extermination.” Monday night’s discussion comes as Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong has faced criticism after she called on Israel to “comply and observe international humanitarian law,” in regards to the government’s attack on civilians in the Gaza Strip. “We know Hamas is a terrorist organisation. It has demonstrated it has no respect for international law, but Australia is a democracy and so too is Israel, and the standards that we seek and accept are higher,” she said on ABC’s Insiders on Sunday. Mr Watts said while a “call for humanitarian pause is the necessary first step,” much more needed to be done. “What we’ve said is there needs to be release of hostages. Hamas needs to stop its rocket attacks on Israel,” he said. “It needs to stop using civilians in Gaza as human shields and for a durable peace in the region, we need to dismantle Hamas.” Mr Sharma, who was also the former MP for the federal seat of Wentworth, which has a large Jewish population, said Hamas needed to be “ousted from political power”. “War is a terrible thing, but we have to remember how this began which is the October 7th terrorist attacks,” he said. “Hamas climbed in through the fence, slaughtered children in their holes. Killed parents in front of their children, raped, abducted, murdered, defiled any number of people. “You leave them there, there will be further bloodshed, further loss of life and further conflict.” Mr Sharma also said political leaders and law enforcement needed to do more to “call out” anti-Semitic behaviour. He said religious services at synagogues have been interrupted, with Jewish-owned businesses boycotted and defaced since the October 7 attack. “That is not acceptable in Australia. Doesn’t matter what your feelings are on in conflict, that is absolutely not acceptable,” Mr Sharma said. When asked by Karvelas who was failing, he named Senator Wong and criticised her response to the pro-Palestinian protest in the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield, which has a high Jewish population. Mr Watts defended Senator Wong’s response, which included tweeting that the violence was unacceptable. “(She) said it was good that they (the protesters) had apologised. Well, yes, it was good … but it shouldn’t have happened,” he said. “When the line is crossed here, it’s not: There’s a fault on all sides here. We need to call out the party that is crossing that line.” Mr Watts disagreed with the criticism. “There are few people in this country having a longer record than fighting prejudice in this country than Penny Wong,” he said. “Penny Wong absolutely condemned anti-Semitism during. Anyone who seeks to undermine her credibility on this issue frankly is seeking to confect difference over this issue.” Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered opposite the synagogue during a Shabbat service after Burgertory, a popular burger joint in the town, was set alight on Friday. There were clashes between police and protesters and the Shabbat service was cancelled. Mr Mashni said the gathering at Caulfield in a park across the road from a synagogue were Friday services were being held was not a protest but an “anti-racism vigil”. “They went to pray and to chant some anti-racism chants,” he said. Karvelas pressed whether “it was OK”, even though “Jewish people were terrified in Caulfield after that night, Mr Mashni doubled down that it was. “I’m hoping for a better tomorrow,” he said. “Can we not agree that as Australians, we should be having conversations, we should be talking about a space where we’re all together.” Ms Albanese also took issue with Mr Leibler’s accusation that she and Mr Mashni had “made it clear that in their view Israel has no right to exist as a state.” She said she found that statement “inappropriate and disrespectful”.

Incubators turned off in Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/no-longer-functioning-gazas-main-alshifa-hospital-is-on-the-brink-as-who-issues-frantic-warning/news-story/b6b0d8e991571a6e777c682ce4710c73,"A “dire and perilous” situation is unfolding in Gaza’s main hospital, with premature babies fighting for life as supplies quickly run out. Gaza City’s primary medical facility, Al-Shifa hospital, is experiencing a catastrophic near-complete power outage, as well as devastating shortages of food and water, medics working at the facility say. World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said “constant gunfire and bombings” in the area around the hospital have “exacerbated the already critical circumstances”, adding that the site “is not functioning as a hospital anymore”. Premature babies that were previously in incubators have since been moved to beds in a surgical ward, after a lack of electricity forced the neonatal unit to shut down. The Israeli military have reiterated that they were “ready to help” evacuate the dozens of vulnerable newborn babies being cared for at the site to another hospital. Israel’s government claim that the terror group Hamas, who perpetuated the kidnappings and murders on October 7, run their headquarters out of an intricate network under the hospital. Hospital chiefs deny this claim. The hospital’s head of surgery, Dr Marwan Abu Saada, revealed thata third premature newborn baby has now diedbecause of a lack of power, according to theBBC. According to the broadcaster, dozens of other newborns are currently not receiving the care they need, with Dr Abu Saada saying he was “afraid we are going to lose the lives of all [the] babies”. The third infant reportedly died from enteritis - an inflammation of the gut to which premature babies are particularly susceptible. Speaking to the BBC, a neonatal care expert said that keeping the babies warm was “vital”, explaining that moderately preterm babies, like those in Al-Shifa, must be kept at the right temperature. UK-based doctor Dr Kevin Goss, consultant neonatologist at Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton, says most, although not all, should normally be in an incubator, and have other basic needs. “Those babies wrapped up in those towels are relying on the ambient temperature,” he said. “Those in the foreground are going potentially to run into trouble quickly if you don’t have a source of heat to keep them warm.” In an update earlier today, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said that there are at least 2,300 people still inside the Al-Shifa hospital. The numbers have been provided to the World Health Organisation, who shared them in a post on X, formerly Twitter. The post claims that there are between 600 and 650 inpatients in the hospital, as well as 200 to 500 health workers and around 1,500 displaced people who have sought shelter. It adds that the lack of power, water, and food at the site is “putting lives at immediate risk”. The WHO repeats its call for an “immediate ceasefire” and the “active protection of civilians and health care”. Israeli president Isaac Herzog has again repeated an allegation that Hamas has its headquarters underneath Al-Shifa. Hamas has denied using the hospital for military purposes. The surgeon described Israel’s allegation as a “big lie” and issued an “open invitation” to its nearby forces to come and inspect the building. Gaza’s second-largest hospital – Al-Quds in Gaza City – is no longer operational, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Yesterday, thousands of displaced Palestinians looked to Gaza’s largest hospital as a safe haven, but withIsraeli strikes intensifyingand the fighting reaching the gates of the compound, there seems nowhere for them to escape. Ahmed al-Shawa, who sought refuge in the hospital, said he was afraid he would be “cut down by shrapnel”, if he stepped outside. “The situation is very, very dangerous,” the 18-year-old from Gaza City said as the sound of explosions echoed in the background. Crowds of people could be seen being crammed into the corridors of Al-Shifa to escape the fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, adding to the overwhelming number of war casualties at the hospital. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Horror scene as Parliament protest erupts,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/greens-leader-adam-bandt-addresses-propalestine-demonstration/news-story/ba671ecf661a534f857215388bf7eef5,"Hundreds of protesters gathered on the front lawns of Parliament House in Canberra, waving Palestinian flags in front of a confronting display of white cloths laid out to represent children killed in Gaza. The cloths were placed in bundles, with names and ages of those who had died in the conflict. They were laid between teddy bears and pairs of shoes, under a sign that read: “Stop the genocide in Gaza. Ceasefire now.” The 400 protestors, many arriving from Sydney and Melbourne, heard from members of the Free Palestine movement, including activists, academics and religious leaders, who called out the government’s inaction. “Albanese you can’t hide, you’re committing genocide,” the protestors chanted. With Labor is refusing to back calls for a ceasefire so far, many Muslim and multicultural communities have become increasingly angered by the government’s response. “We know we’ll be voting for the Greens. Labor be threatened. We’ll be using democracy to vote for the Greens,” the rally’s MC said. The MC also accused the government of being responsible for the bloodshed witnessed during the Israel-Hamas conflict. “Penny Wong, where are you? Where’s your consciousness? Albanese, where are you?” they said. “You have blood on your hands, blood stained hands.” A Palestinian flag was also erected by a demonstrator on one of the flag poles at Parliament House. “This is a message to the Israeli occupation: that we are from Australia, from stolen land, tell you we stand with the Palestinian people. We stand with the Indigenous people. We stand with hope,” the MC said. Greens leader Adam Bandt also addressed the crowd on Monday afternoon, where he was met with loud cheers. In his speech, Mr Bandt called for the government to immediately support a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel to prevent further casualties in Gaza, where the death toll has climbed about 10,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. “We now have over 11,000 civilians dead, over 4,000 of them children … Labor refused to join the rest of the calls of France and most of the rest of the world and call for a ceasefire,” Mr Bandt told the crowd. Bandt’s address follows comments from Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Sunday, where she called on Israel to halt attacks on hospitals in the embattled enclave to avoid further civilian deaths. “We need steps towards a ceasefire. It cannot be one-sided. We know that Hamas is still holding hostages, and we know that a ceasefire must be agreed between the parties,” Wong told the ABC’s Insiders program. But the comments failed to appease the Greens. “We are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe unfold in front of our eyes - no food, no water, no food, no fuel, people starving, dehydration, being bombed ... and yet still, Labor will not call for a ceasefire,” Mr Bandt said. “Labor says that it is concerned about the rising number of civilian casualties - so I ask the Prime Minister, how high does the number need to grow before Labor will join France and the rest of the world in calling for a ceasefire?” he asked. “How many more children need to die? How many more civilians need to suffer?” Mr Bandt promised that the Greens would continue to support the pro-Palestine cause. “We will come back day after day after day to call for a ceasefire now and an end to the occupation because Palestinians are entitled to live in the same just peace and security as Israeli,” he said. the approximately 400 protestors, many arriving from Sydney and Melbourne, heard from a members of the Free Palestine movement, including activists, academics and religious leaders, who called out the government’s inaction. “Albanese you can’t hide, you’re committing genocide,” the protestors chanted. With Labor refusing to back calls for a ceasefire thus far, many Muslim and multicultural communities have become increasingly angered by the government’s response. “We know we’ll be voting for the Greens. Labor be threatened. We’ll be using democracy to vote for the Greens,” the rally’s MC said. The MC also accused the government of being responsible for the bloodshed witnessed during the Israel-Hamas conflict. “Penny Wong, where are you? Where’s your consciousness? Albanese, where are you?” they said. “You have blood on your hands, blood stained hands.” A Palestinian flag was also erected by a demonstrator on one of the flag poles at Parliament House. “This is a message to the Israeli occupation: that we are from Australia, from stolen land, tell you we stand with the Palestinian people. We stand with the Indigenous people. We stand with hope,” the MC said.

Teal MP calls out ‘distressing’ anti-Jew hate,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/australian-jewish-association-starts-up-selfdefence-classes/news-story/d8f841cc553467741d40463b145a4cdc,"A prominent Teal independent has called out the surge in anti-Semitic sentiment washing over Australia in the wake of the October 7 Israel-Gaza war, saying members of her eastern Sydney community have been left “shaken and afraid”. “It’s very distressing that members of the Jewish community feel unsafe in Australia,” Wentworth MP Allegra Spender told NCA NewsWire. “Our country has been regarded as one of the safest places in the world, but the rise in anti-Semitism in recent years and especially in the last month has left many members of my community shaken and afraid.” Her remarks come as some Australian Jews plan to take-up self-defence classes to defend against possible assaults. The Australian Jewish Association, a grassroots social media page that tracks alleged anti-Semitic attacks, said on Sunday it would organise the classes in response to a rise in attacks on Jews. “The attacks on Jews have reached such a level that AJA will be assisting with organising self-defence training for the community,” the post on X states. “Initially in Sydney’s eastern suburbs. Stay tuned for more details.” AJA chief executive Robert Gregory, speaking on Monday, said there was a “lot of fear” in the community and the proposal to put on martial arts training for Jews had been met with an “overwhelming outpouring” of support. “There are a lot of people coming into our community to attack Jews, cause provocations,” he said. “A lot of assaults are unreported.” He said a Jewish martial arts expert had volunteered to put on the classes, which will roll out for people of all ages. Anti-Semitic acts have exploded across Australia after terror group Hamas massacred Israeli civilians on October 7 and Israel responded with a bombing campaign in Gaza. On early Sunday morning, popular Sydney Israeli restaurant Shaffa was vandalised and spray-painted with “child murder” and “steal our identity”. Last Friday, a synagogue was evacuated in Melbourne’s Caulfield after pro-Palestine protesters gathered at a nearby park. Mr Gregory said some Jews believed the NSW Police had not responded to threats against them with “enough force”. “A lot of people don’t think the police are stepping up at the moment,” he said. A NSW Police spokeswoman said the police would continue to engage with community groups and monitor events in Australia and abroad. “Our priority is to ensure that all members of the community feel safe and supported and are free to go about their daily lives without the fear of violence or discrimination,” the spokeswoman said. “The NSW Police Force launched Operation Shelter and the community can be assured we will continue to provide a safe environment for all and that appropriate policing responses are in place across the state.” Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said self-defence classes were “a good thing” but criticised the AJA’s post as “irresponsible”. “These sorts of social media posts are irresponsible as they create the perception that Jews face an immediate threat of being attacked on our streets, which isn’t the case,” he said. “We are urging vigilance while maintaining our way of life as Australians and Jews. “The concern is that things can spiral out of control very quickly. “The scenes from Caulfield … show that anti-Israel thugs are intent on harassing and intimidating Jewish Australians in their homes and in their synagogues. “We need other communities and particularly the federal government to dispense with pro-forma statements about Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and take the threat to Jewish Australians seriously.” Mr Ryvchin said the police were doing a “terrific job” in difficult circumstances and he had “no doubt” they were taking threats seriously and enforcing the law. “But in some cases the laws are unfit for purpose and the rolling anti-Israel protests not only create a massive drain on police and public resources, they are a key mechanism for inciting hatred towards Jewish Australians,” he said. The federal government has allocated $50m to support Jewish and Muslim communities affected by the Hamas attack on Israel and the war’s ongoing fallout. The ECAJ received $25m to enhance safety at Jewish schools and preschools across the country. Australian Palestinian and Muslim communities received $25m to improve safety measures. Ms Spender said she was in “frequent contact”with the Community Security Group, the NSW Police, the NSW government as well as the federal government about ensuring the safety of Wentworth’s Jewish community. “I know the authorities have increased their presence and other measures to keep our community safe,” she said. Authorities have warned of “heavy” traffic and delays in a popular tourist strip after a multi-vehicle accident, believed to have involved a luxury car, forced the road to close.

"50,000 protesters swarm Sydney CBD",https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/50000-protesters-attend-propalestine-rally-at-sydneys-hyde-park/news-story/87662df957a0f66a3ac2b59b1dcb0c58,"Tens of thousands of pro-Palestine protesters flooded Sydney’s Hyde Park calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and condemning the Israeli government’s occupation of Gaza. Organisers claimed more than 50,000 people gathered in Sydney’s CBD at 1pm for a rally before attendees marched through the surrounding streets and returned to Hyde Park. For the fifth consecutive week, protesters waved the red, green, white and black flag of Palestine, with several wearing the kyfiya scarf in solidarity. Chants of: “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” and “Gaza, Gaza, don’t you cry, Palestine will never die,” were shouted by marchers. Speeches from organisers called for a ceasefire and more action from the Australian government. “I have a message for Anthony Albanese and I have a message for the Labor government: ‘What does Israel have to do to earn condemnation,’” said one speaker. “You look around here today, there are not just Muslims today, there are Muslims, there are Christians, there are Jews from Palestine. Every single person has come here today in pursuit of justice.” Earlier today Foreign Minister Penny Wong reiterated calls for Hamas to release Israeli hostages, however said the response couldn’t be “one-sided” and said a ceasefire agreement needed to be reached. “We do call on Israel to cease the attacking of hospitals,” she said. “We understand the argument that Hamas is burrowed into civilian infrastructure, but … I think the international community, looking at what is occurring in hospitals, would say to Israel: ‘These are facilities protected under international law and we want you to do so.’” NSW Police held a highly visible presence on Sunday afternoon at both Hyde Park and in Moore Park, where a pro-Israel ‘Set Them Free’ rally was held at the same time. Both events were attended by officers from Traffic and Highway Patrol Command, and Operation Shelter. In a statement, police said: “The NSW Police Force recognises and supports the rights of individuals and groups to exercise their rights of free speech and peaceful assembly, however, the first priority for NSW Police is always the safety and security of the wider community”. On Sunday, NSW Premier Chris Minns said increased police presence for a major protests costed “in excess of a million dollars,” however said there were “good discussions” between major protest groups, like the Palestine Action Group and police. “In recent weeks, there’s been good conversations between police and these groups, which have kept these protests civil (and) they’re going to have to continue to be because it’s our responsibility to keep the community safe,” he said. Mr Minns said while he believed “increased and heightened protests” were likely to continue in the next few months, he implored groups to follow the rules. “Protest is allowed in NSW but it needs to be done consistent with the law … You can’t allow hate speech in NSW, you can’t use it as a platform for racial vilification or incitement to violence, and the police have shown they will charge people who breach those rules,” he said. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Top Israeli drops one-word bombshell,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-minister-calls-gaza-operation-a-nakba-grave-fears-for-major-hospital/news-story/cdcc054fe9a434fc290e550d284978d6,"Progress has reportedly been made towards a deal that would see some hostages released by Hamas, in return for a days-long pause in the fighting. Publicly, however, the Israeli government maintains there will be no ceasefire unless every single hostage is let go. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war “is advancing with full force” and with only one goal, “to win”. “Grave fears” remain for patients in Gaza’s largest hospital, which ran out of power on Saturday. Israel says it will help facilitate the evacuation of 45 babies whose lives are at risk, though the Hamas-run Gazan health ministry maintains it has heard details of no such plan. And an Israeli minister has caused renewed outrage by referring to the operations in Gaza as a “Nakba” – a term which refers to the expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from what is now Israel in the late 1940s. “We are now actually rolling out the Nakba of Gaza. In the forefront, this is the Nakba of Gaza,” Avi Dichter told a national TV station. “So this is the Nakba of Gaza, Avi Dichter?” asked the channel’s host. “The Nakba of Gaza, 2023,” Mr Dichter affirmed. Progress made towards hostage deal Israel’s major news channels report some progress is being made towards a hostage deal, which would see Hamas release a group of female, elderly and young hostages in return for a temporary pause in the fighting. Hamas abducted hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals during its attack on southern Israel last month. A very small number have since been released, while the rest are reportedly being held inside the terrorist group’s vast network of underground tunnels. The reports in Israeli media suggest a deal would involve 50-100 hostages being released in stages during a pause in hostilities lasting three, or perhaps five days. Israel has previously been reluctant to allow a pause, believing it would allow Hamas to regroup. In his most recent public remarks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested a ceasefire would only be possible if all 239 hostages were released. “The war is advancing with full force, and it has one goal: to win,” he said. “There is no alternative to victory.” Aid agencies ‘complicit in Hamas’s strategy’ A spokesman for the Israeli government, Eylon Levy, has accused international aid agencies of being “complicit” in Hamas’s startegy of hiding behind Gaza’s civilian population. “International agencies in Gaza - the International Committee of the Red Cross, the World Health Organisation, the United Nations - have actively put Palestinian civilians’ lives at risk,” Mr Levy said. “For a month, they’ve refused to support an evacuation from the north. Now they’re endangering everyone by requiring a hasty evacuation in the middle of ground urban warfare. “We hold Hamas responsible for all tragic civilian deaths in Gaza - those killed by its misfired rockets and those it prevented from evacuating - but UN agencies also need to take a long, hard look in the mirror about their complicity with Hamas’s human shield strategy.” The agencies in question have argued that, with something like 1.5 million Palestinians displaced from their homes already and aid shelters well above their intended capacity, there is nowhere for them to escape to. They have also argued that, while urging civilians to evacuate from the north, Israel has continued to launch air strikes in the south of the Gaza Strip as well, meaning “nowhere” is entirely safe. ‘The Nakba of Gaza’: Minister’s stunning answer Avi Dichter is currently Israel’s Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, having previously served as Minister for Internal Security and Home Front Defence. Appearing onthe Israeli news channel N12, he described the current operations in Gaza a “Nakba”. The Nakba was the forced expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from what is now Israel in the late 1940s, which left much of the population – about 700,000 people – displaced. Some historians, though not all, consider it an example of “ethnic cleansing”. “When we see the pictures of a million residents of Gaza walking south with white flags, is this one of the goals, a psychological objective of the operation? Is this a strategic event, (or) is it temporary?” one of the network’s hosts asked Mr Dichter. “First and foremost, it is an operational event. We must understand, we have many of our fighters there, who need to operate in a densely populated area,” he responded. “To operate in a dense area, like there, filled with population, you want to reduce the number of people at the time.” “Is this a Nakba, or is it something temporary? Will they have somewhere to return to?” the host followed up. “We are now actually rolling out the Nakba of Gaza. In the forefront, this is the Nakba of Gaza,” Mr Dichter said. “So this is the Nakba of Gaza, Avi Dichter?” asked the host. “The Nakba of Gaza, 2023,” he affirmed. “Wait, does this mean they are not returning to Gaza City?” said the host. “Look, I don’t know how it will ultimately end. Because remember that Gaza City sits on a third of the Strip,” said Mr Dichter. “There are two more thirds of Gaza.” Mr Dichter has used the term before, in 2007, when he was Minister for Internal Security. “Whoever cries of the Nakba year after year shouldn’t be surprised if they actually have a Nakba eventually,” he said at the time. Biggest Gazan hospital at risk of ‘becoming a morgue’ “Grave concerns” remain for the al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, where the World Health Organisation says it has lost contact with its representatives, and the power has reportedly run out, putting patients’ lives at risk. The hospital, which is the largest in Gaza, has been surrounded by close-quarter fighting in recent days, as well as air strikes, complicating efforts to keep it running – and to evacuate young patients. “As horrifying reports of the hospital facing repeated attacks continue to emerge, we assume our contacts joined tens of thousands of displaced people and are fleeing the area,” the WHO said late on Saturday, local time. “If we do not stop this bloodshed immediately with a ceasefire, or at the bare minimum a medical evacuation of patients, these hospitals will become a morgue,” added the aid group Medicins Sans Frontieres on Sunday. Gaza’s health ministry, which is run by Hamas, says there are 1500 patients at al-Shifa hospital, 1500 medical personnel, and up to 20,000 people seeking shelter. One of those personnel, surgeon Ahmed al-Mokhallalati, told Al-Jazeera his colleagues “can hardly treat the patients” as they’re “in the middle of a war zone”. “There are continuous air strikes and the drones are hovering within the hospital area,” Dr al-Mokhallalati said. “The day before yesterday at about 2am, the electricity stopped because of some issues. The engineer who went to try to fix that was shot by a drone and injured in his neck. Four of his limbs are paralysed. “I saw a family of five in front of my eyes who tried to move east yesterday and they were shot. So they came back injured. “The Israelis also called the hospital director the day before yesterday ordering us to evacuate. He asked them to help arrange a way to evacuate the patients. They didn’t have a plan.” The Gazan health ministry claims two infants who were on incubators in the hospital have already died, and there are another 45 babies at risk. The Israeli military has said publicly that it will help evacuate the infants. However the ministry maintains it has “not been informed about any mechanism to get the babies out to a safer hospital”. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Wong under fire over ceasefire call,https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/penny-wong-says-australia-is-pushing-for-israeli-ceasefire-amid-concerning-hospital-reports/news-story/9d9a35d82007e603a47fe2a5ed46bf2c,"Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong has faced immense resistance from the opposition and Jewish leaders after asking the Israeli government to take steps towards a ceasefire. In what marked a language shift on behalf of the Labor government, Senator Wong called on Israel to stop the “attacking of hospitals” and voiced concern about the safety of civilians. She said how Israel defended itself mattered but when “we affirm Israel’s right to defend itself, what we are also saying is Israel must comply and observe international humanitarian law.” “We know Hamas is a terrorist organisation. It has demonstrated it has no respect for international law, but Australia is a democracy and so too is Israel, and the standards that we seek and accept are higher,” she told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday. Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan condemned Senator Wong’s comments as a display of “moral equivalence” and said they were extremely damaging amid reports of anti-Semitism towards Jewish and Israeli communities. “She needs to get her language right and she needs to condemn Hamas for their actions. She needs to condemn Hamas for holding Israeli hostages and she has to condemn Hamas for wanting to make sure that Israeli doesn’t exist as a state,” Mr Tehan told Sky News. More than 11,000 people in the Gaza Strip have been killed since October 7 when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, killing thousands and taking hundreds of people hostage. The Australian government has asked Israel to show restraint in its response to the terrorist attacks and allow for humanitarian pauses over recent weeks, with Senator Wong’s recent remarks signalling a major policy shift on the issue. The Zionist Federation of Australia and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said in a joint statement they were “highly concerned” by calls for Israel to stop striking hospitals in Gaza. Both groups have resisted Senator Wong’s remarks and claimed there was “no evidence” Israel was not abiding by the rules of armed conflict. “We remind the government that Article 19 of the Geneva Convention explicitly states that hospitals lose their protection if they are used for military purposes. It is incontrovertible that Hamas uses Shifa and other hospitals for military purposes,” the statement read. According to humanitarian medical charity Doctors Without Borders, about 650 patients, including 36 children, are trapped inside al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s biggest hospital complex, amid bombardment by the Israeli military. The World Health Organisation released a statement on Sunday calling the situation “dire and perilous”. Escalating conflict in the Middle East has triggered reports of death threats and street abuse against Jewish Australians, with violent clashes between Palestinian and Israel supporters reported in Melbourne over the weekend. This came after “shocking” figures from Victorian police showed there had been on average three reports of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic behaviour made every day since October 7. Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie said she had serious concerns for children’s safety and claimed there were kids who were “frightened to go to school” and express their religious identity in public. She joined the opposition in criticising Senator Wong’s choice of wording about a ceasefire and said the “sooner we rid the world of terrorists, the better world we will have”. “Penny’s not quite got her words right, but if you start having these ceasefires all you are letting (is) these terrorists regroup. For us to sit there and judge – we’re not even there on the ground with weapons in our hands. We need to be careful with our language,” Senator Lambie said. The Greens leader has issued a warning to the major political parties as he joins a blockade at a major port to demonstrate for environmental change. Holland’s hard-right new leader Geert Wilder’s victory has exposed an issue that Australia needs to learn from.

‘Careful’: Call for calm after chaos at rally,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/opposition-says-caulfield-clash-antisemitic-thuggish-as-richard-marles-calls-for-careful-language/news-story/342bd0e661df9828179096a4a5de050b,"Pro-Palestine protests in Melbourne on Friday night were a display of “anti-Semitic, thuggish behaviour” and an attempt to assert primacy over Jewish Australians, the Coalition has claimed. The opposition’s defence spokesman Andrew Hastie made the claims on Sunday morning, as Defence Minister Richard Marles called for “careful language”. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian supporters entered Caulfield, the heart of Melbourne’s Jewish community, on Friday night to demonstrate after a Palestinian-owned burger shop in the suburb was destroyed by fire the night prior. Hash Tayeh, who owns the Burgertory store, has previously attended pro-Palestine rallies, but had also spoken about his recognition of the plight of Israeli people in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attacks. In an Instagram post on Friday, Mr Tayeh said the incident would “not deter me”. “I am not a coward. My commitment to raising my voice for a ceasefire and peace remains unshaken,” he wrote. While police had said they were “very confident” the blaze had not been racially or politically motivated, pro-Palestine supporters alleged it was a hate crime and called for supporters to gather on Friday night. A clash was sparked after a nearby synagogue was evacuated and Jewish Australians began to counter protest. It escalated into violence and the police had to break up the groups. Organisers of the protest have apologised and claimed they did not realise there was a synagogue in close proximity. Mr Hastie said Friday night had been “an assertion of one group over another for primacy in the public space”, and added it had undermined public safety and public order. “The government has to lead, and they have to give clarity to the Australian people about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable behaviour,” he told Sky News. “We can’t be mealy mouthed about this. We have to be direct and clear. “And for protesters to go into a suburb of Melbourne where we have a lot of Jewish Australians living and to impose themselves upon that group, and to do it in such an anti-social and thuggish way, is just unacceptable.” Mr Marles said Jewish Australians had “never felt less safe” in Australia but welcomed the apology from the Free Palestine group who had organised the protest. “What matters for those of us in positions of leadership is that we are using our voices to turn the temperature down, and that’s actually how we get social cohesion and how we ensure that peace is maintained here in Australia,” he told Sky News. “Jewish Australians have a right to feel safe, be safe in their own country – no ifs and no buts – and that standard applies to every Australian.” Mr Marles said Australians had a right to demonstrate against what was happening in the Middle East and to put pressure on the government, but “social cohesion has to be paramount”. “We do have to look after each other and acknowledge that other Australians are not the focus of the protest,” he said. He said the damage caused to a Melbourne war memorial, coinciding with Remembrance Day on Saturday, was also “unacceptable”. “People have a right to protest the issues that have been raised, and … we live in a country where there is freedom of expression … but people need to take responsibility for the way in which that is occurring,” he said. “Defacing a war memorial does nothing to advance the cause of what’s happening in Gaza. It does nothing to advance the cause of the humanitarian situation … but what it does do is add enormous stress to people seeking to commemorate a very sacred moment in our country’s history.” He said the government was remaining steadfast in its bid to “turn the temperature down”, alluding to growing calls for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza as the death toll in the Palestinian territory continues to climb. Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said the government had called for humanitarian pauses as a necessary first step. “We need steps towards a ceasefire because we know that it cannot be one sided,” she told ABC’s Insiders. “Israel should do everything it can to observe international humanitarian law. “We have seen a harrowing number of civilians, including children, killed. This has to end, and we are particularly concerned with what is happening with medical facilities.” Mr Hastie meanwhile threw unequivocal support behind Israel. “Hamas must be destroyed completely,” he said. “I think Israel has shown great restraint … They’ve had people from across the globe calling on them for restraint and they’ve sent warnings to millions of people living in Gaza to evacuate … They’ve given the opportunity to get out of the danger zone. “For people who say that Israel should show more restraint is I think ignoring the problem, which is that Hamas are using civilians as human shields.” Labor has been slammed for being “out of date” on nuclear energy and having an “obsession” with renewables, just days away from a major climate conference in the Middle East. A major change is coming for dual citizens convicted of terrorism with the government vowing to fix “broken” laws.

‘Catastrophic’ scene at main Gaza hospital,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/heavy-fighting-spurs-catastrophic-scene-at-gaza-hospital/news-story/7a0b9486f9ec54900f21f8f515ad1c74,"Palestinians seeking refuge at Gaza’s largest hospital and staff said they were trapped in increasingly horrific conditions Saturday, with two premature infants dying due to lack of electricity as heavy fighting raged nearby. The gunbattles and intense bombardment around the Al-Shifa hospital came as Israel pressed deep into Gaza City in its offensive aimed at destroying the militant group Hamas in the territory it rules. “Shooting is never stopping, air strikes are unabated as well as artillery shells,” said a witness who spoke on condition of anonymity. “There are dozens of bodies around the complex that nobody can reach.” Though tens of thousands of people have fled the fighting, many have taken shelter in northern Gaza’s hospitals which have been repeatedly hit by explosive strikes and gunfire. “The hospital is besieged, with no option to bring in the corpses and injured people sprawled outside. There is no movement in or out of the hospital,” said Physicians for Human Rights Israel, citing doctors at Al-Shifa. The Israeli doctors’ group added that due to an overnight power outage, the neonatal intensive care unit had stopped working and two premature infants had died, while leaving the lives of 37 other infants at risk. “The situation in Al-Shifa is truly catastrophic,” said Ann Taylor, head of the Palestinian Territories mission for the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The Israeli military has denied there is a siege at Al-Shifa hospital, and has repeatedly accused Hamas of using medical facilities as command centres and hideouts — a charge the group denies. The Israeli army also said it would “provide the assistance needed” to help “babies in the pediatric department to get to a safer hospital” on Sunday, at the request of Al-Shifa staff. Hamas fighters poured through the militarised border with Israel on October 7, killing around 1200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage, according to the most recent Israeli figures. Israel’s campaign has killed more than 11,000 people, also mostly civilians and thousands of them children, according to the latest figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The toll, normally updated daily, could not be calculated Saturday “because of the targeting of hospitals”, the ministry said. Calls for ceasefire grow The conflict has stoked regional tensions, with deadly cross-border exchanges intensifying between the Israeli army and Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Saturday said the group has “bolstered” its action “on the Lebanese front in terms of the number of operations, targets and the type of weapons”. Nasrallah’s speech prompted a warning from Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who said Lebanese citizens would “pay the price” and added, “What we’re doing in Gaza, we can also do in Beirut.” Speaking at a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders in the Saudi capital Riyadh, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called on Islamic governments to designate Israel’s military a “terrorist organisation”. Iran backs Hamas as well as Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Huthi rebels, placing it at the centre of concerns the war could expand. A final statement from the summit rejected Israeli claims that it is acting in “self-defence” and demanded that the United Nations Security Council adopt “a decisive and binding resolution” to halt Israel’s “aggression”. The suffering in Gaza has prompted growing calls for a halt in five weeks of fighting in order to protect civilian lives and allow humanitarian aid into the densely populated territory. French President Emmanuel Macron said Israel had the right to defend itself but urged it to stop strikes on civilians in Gaza, saying there was “no justification”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back, saying the responsibility for any harm to civilians lies with Hamas. “Israel does everything in its power to avoid harming civilians and urges them to leave the battle areas,” he said. ‘State of panic’ In addition to the clashes around Al-Shifa, the situation was fraught at other hospitals in northern Gaza, where Palestinians have sought refuge from intense gunbattles and bombardment. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said that fighting around the Al-Quds hospital had created a “state of panic and extreme fear” among the displaced people sheltering there. The director of the Indonesian hospital said lack of fuel forced the facility to cut power to their desalination plant, medical scanners and lifts. “The hospital is working with 30-40 per cent of its capacity,” Atef Al-Kahlot said. A wounded boy at the Indonesian hospital, Youssef Al-Najjar, said he was waiting for surgery but the necessary machines were off due to lack of power. “I’m very thirsty but I’m not allowed to drink or eat until the operation is done,” he said. Twenty of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are “no longer functioning”, the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA said. Tens of thousands flee Fighting has reduced some streets in Gaza to ruins, with the sounds of apparent explosions and gunfire caught Saturday on AFPTV’s Gaza City camera. The bodies of about 50 people killed in a strike on Gaza City’s Al-Buraq school were taken to the Al-Shifa hospital, its director said Friday. Israel on Saturday said its forces launched an air strike on the school that killed a Hamas company commander, accusing the group of using civilians as “human shields” — a charge it denies. The exodus toward Gaza’s south, which has accelerated under intense fighting, has seen tens of thousands of people flee in recent days. An estimated 30,000 additional Palestinians went southward through an evacuation corridor opened by the Israeli military on Friday, according to OCHA. But the UN agency said “several explosions were recorded in that ‘corridor’, resulting in fatalities and injuries, among those fleeing, according to initial reports”. The Israeli military said “armed terrorists approached the troops, and fired RPGs toward them”. In all, the Israeli army said that in the last three days around 200,000 Palestinians had left southward from the area of the northern Gaza Strip where combat is heavy. However, strikes were hitting buildings at the southern end of Gaza in Rafah, the area of the densely populated territory to which civilians have been urged to evacuate. “They struck us with a missile, and these are innocent people,” said Harb Fojou, standing near the rubble of a destroyed building. Almost 1.6 million people have been internally displaced since October 7, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA — about two thirds of Gaza’s population. Hamas’s bloody October 7 attacks and Israel’s relentless military campaign have sparked public demonstrations around the world. An estimated 300,000 marched through London in support of Palestinians on Armistice Day, Britain’s annual commemoration of its war dead. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Pro-Palestine bike convoy draws criticism,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/propalestine-motorbike-convoy-draws-sydney-jewish-community-criticism/news-story/d32d4508fcdcb3b0377ffaf8e1dba096,"A motorbike and truck convoy, making its way through Sydney’s east, has copped criticism from both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine supporters, and branded “psychological warfare.” About a dozen riders from Al Quds community centre in Regents Park, their bikes adorned with Palestine flags, made their journey from Lidcombe to Coogee on Saturday evening, followed by utes. Leading the convoy was organiser Zaky Mallah, the first Australian to be charged with terrorism offences after threatening to blow up ASIO and DFAT offices in 2003. Escorted by police, the ride was largely uneventful until they reached Coogee, where nearly 100 protesters bearing Israel flags were waiting on the beachfront. There was a tense standoff between the two groups, until police managed to separate them, and the riders continued on their way. Prominent Palestine activist Fahad Ali joined a raft of Sydney’s Jewish community members condemning the ride. “This is a deliberately provocative action. It has no strategic purpose. No one I know in the Palestinian community is on board with this,” he wrote on Twitter, now known as X. Mr Ali said he couldn’t vouch for the group, and they’re not known to established organising groups. “If things go awry, who is going to bear the consequences? We are. Palestinians organisers and the movement as a whole. My view on this is not going to shift,” he wrote. NSW Jewish Board of Deputies President David Ossip was more scathing in his remarks, made despite Saturday being the Jewish holy day, Shabbat. “There is no reason why a notionally peaceful anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian protest needs to make its way from Lidcombe to Coogee, it is clear that the route has been chosen for one purpose – to intimidate and scare the Jewish community,” Mr Ossip told The Daily Telegraph. “This is psychological warfare and it should not be tolerated in Sydney. I share the outrage and frustration that the community is feeling.” Vaucluse MP Kellie Sloane said she was “deeply troubled” by the motorcade. “The pro-Palestinian motorcyclists have chosen a deliberately provocative route into the heart of Sydney’s largest Jewish community. There is no doubt in my mind this is designed to intimidate,” she wrote on X. The motorcade protest came just hours after dozens of protesters, some creating a jetski blockade out on the water, rallied against Israeli shipping line ZIM after a ship of theirs declared their intention to dock in Botany Bay. Palestine Justice Movement Sydney (PJMS) organised the protest, which kicked off about midday Saturday, ultimately causing those in command of the vessel to decide against docking. Authorities had been hoping Saturday’s protests wouldn’t echo violent clashes seen in Melbourne on Friday night between pro-Palestine and pro-Israel demonstrators. Authorities have warned of “heavy” traffic and delays in a popular tourist strip after a multi-vehicle accident, believed to have involved a luxury car, forced the road to close. Thousands of young music lovers have descended on one of the largest festivals of the year, but there are serious concerns about hail, rain and dangerous winds.

Wild scenes at major Aussie port,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/transporter-of-armaments-pro-palestine-activists-protest-israeli-shipping-line-zim-at-port-botany/news-story/3be1661107e338719efcc2246f58dd06,"Pro-Palestine activists have taken to the waters of a major Aussie port after Israeli shipping line ZIM announced it was attempting to dock at Sydney’s Port Botany. The rally, which began at noon on Saturday, was organised by the Palestine Justice Movement Sydney (PJMS), and spurred the gathering of a large crowd at the Foreshore Boat Ramp. Dozens gathered at the Foreshore Boat Ramp — some even taking to the water in a bid to deter the ship — calling for a boycott of the “major transporter of armaments”. “The ZIM shipping line is a major transporter of armaments,” PJMS posted to social media. “It isn’t welcome in Port Botany, or anywhere people stand against genocide and war crimes.” It is understood the ship was not at port as its crew had decided not to dock in light of the protest. Protesters gathered on land and also on jet skis adjacent to the massive container ship, and were heard chanting: “Resistance is justified when Palestine is occupied”. The rally went ahead on Saturday despite calls from the NSW Premier Chris Minns against any attempt to “block the boat”, as PJMS said. “I just want to make it clear that living in a free country doesn’t mean that you can walk down to the port and stop lawful trade between Australia and its trading partners across the world,” Mr Minns said to 2GB’s Ben Fordham on Tuesday. “I didn’t see these people down at the port when it comes down to trade with Cuba or Saudi Arabia or China or any other country where there may be disagreements with or domestic unrest about so they shouldn’t be doing it when it comes down to Israel as well.” This comes after Israel’s assault on Gaza pushed the Palestinian death toll past 10,000 since October 7. The White House on Thursday claimed Israel would permit “limited pauses” in its military operations “for humanitarian reasons”. The death toll includes more than 4,100 children and 2,640 women, with the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres labelling the war zone a “graveyard for children”. On Friday night violence erupted in Melbourne’s southeast as pro-Palestine and pro-Israel protesters clashed following a suspicious fire at a Palestinian-owned burger shop. Police deployed pepper spray to break up the scuffle which occurred on Hawthorn Rd in Caulfield. Authorities have warned of “heavy” traffic and delays in a popular tourist strip after a multi-vehicle accident, believed to have involved a luxury car, forced the road to close.

Wild Gaza-Israeli clash rocks synagogue,https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/crime/police-probe-launched-after-wild-scenes-erupt-outside-melbournes-caulfield-synagogue-over-gaza-conflict/news-story/f580d2a38df49db37e3b07cda23d8ccf,"A police probe has been launched after footage captured violent scenes between protesters and police, following heightened tensions over the alleged arson of a pro-Palestinian burger store. Victoria Police attended the rally that began in Princes Park in Caulfield South at about 7:30pm on Friday night, with approximately 200 protesters in attendance. They were met by a group of approximately 200 attendees from the nearby Caulfield synagogue and pro-Israel protesters who yelled at the protesters. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters had gathered opposite the synagogue during a Shabbat service after Burgertory, a popular burger joint in the town, was set alight on Friday. Footage of the incident shows several men throwing punches in the middle of a road as police officers attempt to separate the clashing groups. Police were also seen pepper spraying a man before throwing him to the ground and arresting him. Rocks were allegedly thrown and one man reported receiving minor injuries after being hit. Caulfield is one of Melbourne’s Jewish enclaves with over 40 per cent of the population reporting their religion as Judaism in the last census. The confrontation was sparked afterBurgertory was damaged by fire. Hash Tayeh, the restaurant’s founder, is prominent supporter of Palestine who has spoken publicly about the conflict in Gaza. Mr Tayeh was pictured last month leading chants at a pro-Palestine rally in Melbourne of “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”. Police have said: “The exact cause of the fire is being investigated but is being treated as suspicious at this stage.” Despite the chaos on Friday night, Victoria Police said there were “no major incidents of note” at the protest when contacted by NCA Newswire. “ Police will investigate both incidents further and will review CCTV and vision from the event to detect any other offences,” a spokesperson said. “Our top priority was keeping the peace to ensure the event did not impact the safety of the broader community. “We will continue to retain communication with all communities which have a strong interest in events unfolding in the Middle East.” The Herald Sun has reported a strong security presence outside the Maple Street synagogue on Saturday morning. The event has drawn fierce criticism across Australia, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese calling for calm. “This is a day when we pause to give thanks for the sacrifices so many Australians have made to keep our nation free and peaceful,” he said in a statement on Saturday. “All of us have a responsibility to preserve that peace here at home. To maintain the harmony and respect that unites us. “It is always worth repeating: there is no place in our nation for hatred or prejudice of any kind.” His Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong condemned the actions of violent protesters. “There is no place for violence, no place for antisemitism and no place for Islamophobia in Australia,” she wrote on social media. “People come to Australia because they want to live in a country that is peaceful, tolerant and respectful. We all must protect that. “The violence in Caulfield is unacceptable.” Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan also condemned the protests, urging Victorians to show “support in these difficult times”. “It is our diversity that makes us great, and our compassion that unites us – there is never any place for antisemitism or Islamophobia in Victoria,” she said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called for urgent action after an alarming spike in the number of women killed by domestic violence.

Dangerous reaction to pro-Palestine protests,https://www.news.com.au/world/the-urge-to-crack-down-on-propalestinian-protests-is-dangerous-and-selfdefeating/news-story/99e2de5828ccefb2ff0b0f365b49d30d,"Comment Is there an issue in Western politics more chronically laced with hypocrisy than freedom of speech? We swap roles more frequently than a back-up actor in the theatre: one day maligning co-called cancel culture, the next demanding that someone else be silenced. The last several days of British politics – which increasingly resembles our own, from itsrevolving door of prime ministersto itsrhetoric about “stopping the boats”– have been dominated by a looming pro-Palestinian march in the heart of London. It’s not the first such protest, but it may be the largest, with tens of thousands expected to participate. At the heart of Britain’s government, run by the ostensibly pro-free speech Tories, leading figures feel it should not be allowed to happen. Chief among them is the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, who has described the nation’s pro-Palestinian demonstrations as “hate marches” andpublicly criticised the policefor, in her view, failing to curtail them. “I do not believe that these marches are merely a cry for help for Gaza. They are an assertion of primacy by certain groups – particularly Islamists,” Ms Braverman wrote this week. She argued the police were “playing favourites” by being soft on pro-Palestinian and Black Lives Matter protesters, having previously cracked down on white nationalist and anti-Covid lockdown demonstrations. The data doesn’t support her. Go back to 2020, at the height of the Covid dramas, and you will find London’s Metropolitan Police made 281 arrests at Black Lives Matter protests, 681 at Extinction Rebellion protests, and 374 at the anti-lockdown protests. We can critique the Met’s competence, but there is no proof to support Ms Braverman’s perception of a leftist or “woke” ideological slant (even ignoring recent findings that the organisation isinstitutionally racist, misogynist and homophobic). The figures instead suggest a police force that approaches public order in more or less the same way regardless of who is protesting. The march’s critics have also fretted about it falling on the same weekend as Armistice Day, claiming the timing is disrespectful, and talking up fears that the Cenotaph, a war memorial in the centre of the city, could be vandalised. Never mind that the protest is scheduled for well after Saturday morning’s commemorations. Never mind that its route goes nowhere near the Cenotaph. Never mind that its participants are seeking a ceasefire, on a day that’s intended not to glorify war, but to remind us of its horrors and sacrifices. The common sense, calm approach to this march, and its imitators in Australia, is simple enough: people have the right to express their opinions. Anyone who tries to incite hatred or violence, which is against the law in both countries, must be arrested and charged. Easy. I’ve seen assertions this week that the demonstrators “are free to call for a genocide” against the world’s only Jewish state. No, they’re not. Theyarefree to call for an end to the violence, and for the human rights and dignity of the Palestinians to be respected. That is not the same thing, much as some cynics or ideologues yearn to conflate the two. To suggest that everyone who protests against the bombing of the Gaza Strip, and the inevitable civilian deaths it causes, is part of a “hate march” is preposterous, histrionic, the mother of all generalisations. It reeks of disingenuous fear. And the overwhelming sense you get from Ms Braverman is that shewantsto foment fear. Shewantsdivision. Shewantsa flashpoint in the culture wars. Shewantsthereto be trouble, the more the better, so she can point to it afterwards and shout “I told you so”. In the wake of her deliberately inflammatory remarks this week,far-right counter-protesters announced their intentionto descend upon London to confront the march. Nakedly increasing the risk of unrest, or even violence. This is the precise inverse of how governments around the world should behave. Leaders should be easing tensions, bridging divisions and defending people’s right to be heard. Let the police enforce the law, without pressuring them to overstep its boundaries. There’ll be idiots marching in London on Saturday, just as there were idiots marching in Melbourne during Covid (though without the same health concerns this time). And there will be many thousands of people marching for peace with no malice in their hearts. What would it say about the West if the UK were to shut down the entire event, pre-emptively, silencing peace and hate marcher alike, treating them as the same? It would expose us as fearful, suspicious, and intolerant – and expose our commitment to free speech and political dissent as hollow. We should enforce the law as it stands. The self-defeating alternative is to reimagine it, as needed, to fit our political prejudices. And to degrade our freedoms, oh so ironically, in the name of protecting them.

Gaza ‘on its knees’ as rockets rain down,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-israel-vows-to-remain-in-control-of-gaza/news-story/a25e66c5b04c073258fb496e73a10e26,"Israel has made a vow to “control” Gaza amid five weeks of violent retaliation from the Israeli military following the deadly Hamas attack on October 7. Despite previously claiming Israel did not want to occupy the region once the war ends, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now backtracked, saying Israeli defence forces will “remain in control of the Strip”. “We will not give it to international forces,” he said. His vow comes after the US suggested the security of Gaza should by managed by an international force with troops from Arab states, when the conflict ends. Since October 7, Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 11,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the health military in the Hamas-run territory. This follows violent attacks from the militant group in southern Israel, which killed more than 1200 people, the majority being civilians according to Israeli officials. Warning as Gaza reaches ‘point of no return’ Gaza City appears to be under a heavy rocket attack, with a vision from Al Jazeera showing orange streaks raining down on the area. It comes as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned the healthcare system in Gaza has “reached a point of no return”, with attacks on medical facilities and personnel dealing a “heavy blow” to the area’s struggling healthcare system. William Schomburg, head of ICRC sub-delegation in Gaza, said the destruction affecting Gaza’s hospitals has become “unbearable”, with the lives of thousands of civilians, patients and medical staff at risk. It comes as Gaza’s largest hospital, Al Shifa, was hit by a strike Friday that its director said killed 13 people The Israeli army has repeatedly accused Palestinian militant group Hamas of using hospitals, particularly Al-Shifa, to co-ordinate their attacks and also as hideouts for its commanders. Hamas authorities deny the accusations. “There is no safe place left. The army hit Al-Shifa. I don’t know what to do,” 32-year-old Abu Mohammad, who was among those seeking refuge at the hospital, told the AFP. “There is shooting … at the hospital. We are afraid to go out.” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organisation, said Gaza’s health care system was “on its knees”. “Hospital corridors crammed with the injured, the sick, the dying; morgues overflowing; surgery without anaesthesia; tens of thousands of displaced people sheltering at hospitals,” he said, noting that half of the territory’s 36 hospitals are no longer functioning. Israel denies hospital attack, accuses Hamas The Israeli military has denied claims it was responsible for the attack on Gaza’s Al Shifa hospital, which reportedly killed 13 people. The denial was issued in a post on Israel’s official X account, formerly known as Twitter. “Earlier today, the IDF received reports of a hit on the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City,” the post read. “The Hamas-run media office in the Gaza Strip immediately claimed that this was a strike carried out by the IDF.” Officials have instead accused Hamas militants of being behind the strike. “An examination of IDF operational systems indicates that a misfired projectile launched by terrorist organisations inside the Gaza Strip hit the Shifa Hospital,” the post read. “The misfired projectile was aimed at IDF troops operating in the vicinity.” Macron calls on Israel to stop ‘bombing, killing’ women, babies French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the Israeli military to stop bombing and killing women and babies. Speaking to the BBC following a humanitarian aid conference in Paris about the war in Gaza, Mr Macron called for a ceasefire, saying there was “not justification” for the air strikes that have been carried out by Israel, He branded the actions of Hamas as “terrorism” and said France “clearly condemns” the militant group’s October 7 attack. However, he noted that “having a large bombing of Gaza” is not the best way for Israel to protect itself. “There is no other solution than first a humanitarian pause, going to a ceasefire, which will allow [us] to protect … all civilians having nothing to do with terrorists,” Mr Macron said. “De facto – today, civilians are bombed – de facto. These babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed. So there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop.” Israel death toll lowered Israel has revised down the death toll from last month’s Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1400 to about 1200, according to a foreign ministry spokesman. “This is an updated estimate,” ministry spokesman Lior Haiat told AFP. Israel previously said Hamas fighters who poured across the heavily militarised border on October 7 killed 1400 people, mostly civilians. But in an unrelated statement on Friday that was critical of the UN’s cultural agency UNESCO, Haiat said Hamas murdered “about 1,200 people”. -AFP ‘Do what we need to’: Israel’s chilling hospital warning Israeli troops were closing in on hospitals in Gaza City on Friday, an Israeli official said. This comes as its battle with Hamas engulfed more of the city and raised fears that vulnerable patients and sheltering civilians with nowhere to flee could be harmed by Israeli strikes and running street battles. “We’re aware of the sensitivity of the hospitals. That’s why we’re slowly closing in on them,” the Israeli military spokesman, Richard Hecht, told reporters. He said that Israeli forces generally do not fire on hospitals, but added: “If we see Hamas terrorists firing from hospitals, we’ll do what we need to do.” He also said that Israeli troops were “closing in” on Hamas in northern Gaza. Following fighting around Al Shifa hospital, Israeli forces claimed it had killed dozens of militants and destroyed tunnels that are key to Hamas’s capacity to fight.

Unexpected backflip in Israel conflict,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-is-facing-a-collapse-in-support-for-its-ongoing-conflict/news-story/91b255412f027ac174ecf0b422505bb8,"ANALYSIS A month after the murderous attack on civilians by Hamas terrorists, Israel is facing a collapse in international support. And the fallout has global implications. International support immediately after theOctober 7 attackwas decisive. Leaders lined up to condemn the killing and hostage-taking. The US immediately dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups, billions of dollars in military aid – and forceful moral support. “The message that I bring you is this: you may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself — but as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to,” saidUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “We will always be there by your side.” But now, the US and its closest supporters – Australia and the UK – are becoming increasingly isolated in their support ofPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’scoalition government. This week, Spain’s social affairs minister Ione Belarra stood up andlabelled Israel’s assault on the Gazan Palestinian population “a genocide”. And Belgium’s Deputy Prime Minister Petra de Sutter publicly called for European Union sanctions to be imposed against the Netanyahu government. But the United States has voted against a UN motion advocating a “humanitarian pause” in Gaza. Australia and the UK abstained. That’s despite all repeatedly advocating for a “humanitarian ceasefire” in Ukraine. The notion that war is a valid tool to change international borders has been rejected in Ukraine. And China’s being warned about the use of force against India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. But the US backs Israel’s annexation of much of UN 1947 Partition Plan Palestine. And the US and Australia have loudly condemned the recent forced displacement of up to 200,000 ethnic Rohingya from their homes by the Myanmar military. But the same tactic has evoked little comment when applied to the 1.5 million forced to flee Gaza City. “What are painted as innocent civilians in the former case have become collateral damage in the latter,” arguesOverseas Development Institute (ODI) researcher Dustin Barter. And it’s not lost on China. Beijing has already moved to wedge the West’s acceptance of Israel’s assault on Gaza as justification for its genocidal acts against ethnic Islamic Uighurs in Xinjiang Province. “Few believe this (international) order possesses either moral legitimacy or political credibility,” arguesLowy Institute fellow Dr Bobo Lo. “Its ‘rules’ are seen as self-serving – a code of the West, by the West, for the West. Rarely has the United States, and the West in general, seemed more out of sync with the rest of the world.” Anti-Semitic upsurge Recent polling by the Brookings Institution think-tank confirms the rapid evaporation of sympathy for Israel’s plight. “The two polls that we have conducted so far since the start of the war in Israel and Gaza show the biggest changes in attitudes that we have ever measured from poll to poll in years of tracking American public attitudes on the Israeli-Palestinian issue — and these changes are almost certainly related to the ongoing war,” says senior fellow Shibley Telhami. “Much of the initial bump in support for Israel that the American public exhibited early after the Hamas attack has not survived the reactions to the Israeli attacks in Gaza.” Indicative of this reaction is a global upsurge of “antisemitic incidents”. This classification ranges from violent assaults to the removal of pro-Israeli paraphernalia. The Anti-Defamation League last week reported a 400 per cent spike in such activity within the United States. A similar surge has been seen in Europe. Many of these hate crimes are brutal. A Jewish woman was stabbed to death in Lyon, France. A swastika was smeared on her door. A synagogue in Berlin was recently firebombed, as was a cemetery in Vienna. And Nazi-style Stars of David have been painted on the doors of Jewish properties from Paris to Berlin. “It is unbearable that Jews are living in fear again today — in our country of all places,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier stated. “Every single attack on Jews, on Jewish institutions, is a disgrace for Germany.” Empire of dust Israel’s own government appears to have been falling over itself to generate a backlash. It has not just reacted to a terrorist raid with bombs and bullets. It has cut supplies of water, food, fuel and electricity to the entire Gazan population. Doctors Without Borders has called the devastation “one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes that we have ever seen”. And the International Committee of the Red Cross tweeted: “The human suffering is shocking. Thousands killed. People have limited access to food and water. Hospitals are near collapse. Hospital corridors are full of wounded and displaced. Destroyed infrastructure and homes will take years to rebuild. Even wars have limits.” Meanwhile, Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has described Hamas as “human animals”. “I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,” he said. “We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly.” Former Israeli General Giora Eiland backed up the statement, saying Israel “must create an unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Gaza”. “Only the mobilisation of tens of thousands and the cry of the international community will create the leverage for Gaza to be either without Hamas or without people. We are in an existential war,” Eiland declared. Former Defence Minister Benny Gantz, who joined Netanyahu’s emergency unity government last month, also called Hamas an “existential threat”. And that, he added Thursday, justifies moves to impose “security superiority” over Gaza. In the face of an unverified 10,000 dead Palestinians, the justification to avenge 1400 Jewish dead and 200 hostages risks wearing thin. “Israel’s de facto justification amounts to an argument that visiting death and devastation upon civilians is acceptable as long as the attempt to eliminate a loathsome villain is successful,” arguesForeign Policy journal analyst Howard French. “The problem here should be obvious to all. The resort to barbarity, such as Israel has employed in its campaign to snuff out Hamas, is itself uncivilised and surely plants the seeds for more savagery on both sides in the future.” But Israeli commentators feel their plight is being ignored. “Some suspect that there’s a double standard at play when people furiously condemn the killing of Palestinian civilians, but say nothing, or even excuse it when Israeli civilians are killed,” arguesUniversity of California Los Angeles Professor of Israel Studies, Dov Waxman. “In the case of Israel, its existence and legitimacy are still challenged. There are still many people who would rather there not be a state of Israel, at least not a Jewish state.” Undermining the “International Order” Israel’s right to defend itself is a clear right under international law. The deliberate targeting of civilians and taking of hostages to act as human shields firmly placed Hamas as the instigator of this particular round of the 75-year-old conflict. “Like all nations, though, Israel must be held to the laws and conventions that regulate warfare, as well as to a common sense of decency and proportion,” argues French. “Biblical-style vengeance may be emotionally satisfying for some, and it may appeal strongly to the religious elements of the Israeli leader’s base, but this is a recipe for repeated and continued atrocities and the heedless violation of innocent lives.” The widespread perception of double standards threatens to accelerate the world down a path towards a multipolar cluster of great powers. “It is uncertain how the situation over Gaza and the future of Palestine will develop. What is clear, though, is that the events of the past month have shown that the usual recipes for international problem-solving are no longer fit for purpose,” warns Dr Lo. “Looking ahead, the choice is stark. Leaders can cling on to anachronistic tropes – the ‘rules-based order’, the illusion of ‘universal’ values, the myth of great power (‘multipolar’) governance, and an obsessive preoccupation with geopolitical competition. “Or they can get real and accept that today’s threats and challenges – from conflict in the Middle East to anthropogenic climate change – require fundamentally different, more inclusive and cooperative approaches. “Make the wrong choice and we will discover that the current conflict, far from being an aberration, is the harbinger of an increasingly confrontational and anarchic world.” Jamie Seidel is a freelance writer |@JamieSeidel Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Gaza protesters storm major newspaper,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hundreds-of-antiisrael-protesters-accuse-biden-of-backing-genocide-as-they-swarm-ny-times-building/news-story/bd13b5d6d6e59ff066d4ff322f043695,"Hundreds of anti-Israel protesters descended on Bryant Park Thursday afternoon and later occupied the lobby of theNew York Times building as they called for the elimination of the Jewish state and accused President Biden of backing “genocide.” The crowds of demonstrators labelled Israel a “terrorist state” while chanting “From river to the sea, Palestine will be free” – a phrase known to call for the eradication of Israel – as they marched through mid-town on Thursday evening (local time). The large rally is the latest in a series of fiery protests to engulf the Big Apple since the October 7 Hamas terror attack that led Israel to launch retaliatory strikes. “Biden, Biden, you can’t hide, you’re supporting genocide,” protesters also yelled just hours after the commander in chief told reporters there is “no possibility” of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Protesters occupied the lobby of theTimesbuilding as they chanted outside of it and handed out mock newspaper copies of “The New York War Crimes.” “We will continue holding theNew York Timesto account … for inciting genocide,” the chants boomed. “Not another nickel, not another dime, no more money for theNew York Times. Not another nickel, not another dime, no more money for Israel’s crimes. “New York Times, you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide.” They also chanted, “F**kNew York Times” and “Tell the truth.” Cops were in the lobby with the protesters who entered and later were able to clear the area. Outside the building, the back window of an NYPD cruiser was smashed and spray painted with “FREE GAZA” on the side of it. A smoke bomb was also tossed nearby and “Free Palestine” was scrawled across a Starbucks window at theTimesbuilding, law enforcement sources toldThe Post. One protester, Queens resident Ryan Bartok, 31, claimed the Gray Lady is pushing out “the propagandised narrative put out by the Israeli state.” Another demonstrator, Queens resident Agatha James, 31, said the protesters went to the Times building to send a “clear message.” “The direct action inside the building was to send a clear message to the editorial board of theNew York Timesabout their complicity in the deaths of Palestinians and about the refusal to call for a ceasefire and accurately report on the reality of what is happening – a genocide,” James said. No arrests were immediately reported on Thursday evening, cops said. The protesters disbanded at around 6pm. Earlier in the rally, demonstrators scaled statues outside the New York Public Library where they waved Palestinian flags. A 22-year-old NYU graduate student was swarmed by protesters and jostled after he yelled in Hebrew “Long live the beautiful state of Israel” while brandishing a poster of an Israeli hostage kidnapped by Hamas. “I walked in, I stood there, and I just felt the need to be the one voice in that entire crowd standing against this,” the student toldThe Post. He said he was on his way home from a seminar. “I chanted in Hebrew, which means ‘long live the people of Israel’ or ‘life to the people of Israel’ and a swarm of them came at me, yelling, one of them took the poster out of my hand,” the Murray Hill resident who has family in Israel said. “Is that not a kidnapped human being? Then they yelled ‘go back to Israel.’” This article originally appeared on theNew York Postand was reproduced with permission Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

‘Horrific’ scenes ScoMo witnessed,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/radio/scott-morrison-describes-horrific-scenes-in-israel/news-story/f835c020d0b3591a96d26fad8fb0f6be,"Scott Morrison has spoken about his recent trip to Israel with former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, describing what they witnessed as “horrific”. The former prime minister didn’t hold back when asked what he had seen, even apologising to those who were listening as he described the war zone to 2GB’s Ben Fordham. “We went down to Kfar Aza, which is one of the kibbutz that were one of the scenes of the atrocities in the attacks that took place,” he said. “To walk through what was once an incredibly peaceful place and to see the devastation and to be shown what happened and where it happened. “The murders, the children being abducted and others being beheaded, I’m sorry, for those who are listening, but I mean, this is what happened.” Mr Morrison continued, stating that he had never before heard about, or seen, anything like what had happened there in his life. “There were reports of women being scalped,” he said. “The premeditation of this attack, the level of drilling that would have gone on beforehand as they executed these atrocities without warning and unprovoked. “It was, undoubtedly, the worst thing I’ve ever heard and ever had the misfortune to be in a place where that had happened.” When asked if he had been shown any footage, Mr Morrison said he and Mr Johnson were presented with photos while touring with the Israeli soldiers who arrived just after the attacks. Mr Morrison said they described how Hamas had left nasty surprises for them. “The bodies were booby trapped, which was intended to kill those who were coming and providing aid and support to the people,” he said. “They had their own photos, and they were sharing them with Boris and I, at the very site where these things were taking place.” Mr Morrison said he supported the White House announcement that Israel would hold momentary “pauses” in northern Gaza to help Palestinian civilians flee the city. The former prime minister also said it wasn’t a decision influenced by him or any other former leaders. “I’m pleased that Israel has made that decision,” he said. “And that’s a decision that they’ve made (themselves). “In the statements that I signed along with the other former prime ministers, we said it wasn’t our task to instruct or lecture Israel on how they went ahead and conducted things operationally.” As for the visit itself, which Fordham said “surprised a lot of people”, Mr Morrison said it wasn’t initially planned and came down to timing. “I was in London on other business and Boris and I were catching up with friends,” he said. “We went through a lot together as Prime Ministers during the pandemic and AUKUS and trade agreements and so on. “We were just catching up and he said, ‘Look, what are you doing this weekend?’ and I said I was heading home and he said, ‘Well, would you like to come to Israel with me?’” jordan.mccarthy@gmail.com.au | @JordoMc85 To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout Kyle Sandilands left a furious voicemail to Steve Price, after the latter dubbed him a “grubby buffoon” on The Project this week.

Detail in photo sparks disturbing claim,https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/israel-demands-answers-from-ap-reuters-cnn-nyt-over-presence-of-photographers-on-october-7/news-story/1ac6ecdf1666957a91717619bf2bc2e9,"A pro-Israel media watchdog has raised questions about the presence of photographers working for some of the world’s biggest news organisations on the morning Hamas launched the bloody October 7 terror attacks. Four photographers working for The Associated Press (AP) and two working for Reuters were at the border with Gaza in time to document the invasion by Hamas terrorists that left some 1400 dead and 240 kidnapped, according toan articlepublished on Wednesday by the Honest Reporting group. The US-Israeli watchdog questioned whether the Gaza-based photographers had foreknowledge of attacks, arguing use of their work by major international media outlets raised “serious ethical questions”. “What were they doing there so early on what would ordinarily have been a quiet Saturday morning?” Honest Reporting wrote. “Did the respectable wire services, which published their photos, approve of their presence inside enemy territory, together with the terrorist infiltrators? Did the photojournalists who freelance for other media, like CNN andThe New York Times, notify these outlets? Judging from the pictures of lynching, kidnapping and storming of an Israeli kibbutz, it seems like the border has been breached not only physically, but also journalistically.” Four names appear on AP’s photo credits from the Israel-Gaza border on October 7. AP appears to havesince removedsome of the photographers’ names from its captions. As the attacks were unfolding, one of the AP’s freelancers, Hassan Eslaiah, crossed into Israel and took photosand videoof a burning Israeli tank, writing in Arabic in the since-deleted video’s caption on X, “Live from inside the Gaza Strip settlements.” A resurfaced image onsocial mediashows Eslaiah getting a kiss on the cheek from Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar, 61, dubbed Israel’smost wantedand called a “dead man walking” by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is accused of orchestrating the October 7 massacre alongside Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas’ military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. Reuters also published images from two photojournalists “who also happened to be at the border just in time for Hamas’ infiltration”, Honest Reporting wrote. There is no suggestion that any of the photographers took part in any of the activities they were photographing, nor that they are affiliated or associated with Hamas. Honest Reporting’s article said two of AP’s photographers were both “positioned to get pictures of the horrific abductions of Israelis into Gaza”. Among the harrowing photos was an image of German-Israeli tattoo artistShani Louk, 23, her legs visible on the bed of a white pick-up truck as she was taken back to Gaza after being kidnapped from the Nova music festival. The caption of the AP photo incorrectly describes Ms Louk as “an Israeli soldier”. Widely-circulated video later showed Hamas fighters parading Ms Louk’s naked and badly brutalised body on the back of the same truck through Gaza. Israeli officials latelast monthdeclared Ms Louk dead, after finding a fragment of her skull during operations inside Gaza. Honest Reporting said while news agencies “may claim that these people were just doing their job”, it was “not that simple”. “Is it conceivable to assume that ‘journalists’ just happened to appear early in the morning at the border?” it said. “Even if they didn’t know the exact details of what was going to happen, once it unfolded did they not realise they were breaching a border? And if so, did they notify the news agencies? Some sort of communication was undoubtedly necessary – before, after or during the attack – in order to get the photos published.” The piecehas causeda stir in Israel, and the government on Thursday wrote to four foreign news organisations seeking clarification regarding the behaviour of the photographers. “It has come to our attention that certain individuals within your organization, including photographers and others, had prior knowledge of these horrific actions and may have maintained a troubling connection with the perpetrators,” Communications MinisterShlomo Karhiwrote in the letter addressed to AP, Reuters, CNN andThe New York Timesshared on X. News outlets hit back All four news organisations categorically denied the claims. The Associated Press said in an emailed statement that “AP uses images taken by freelancers around the world, including in Gaza”. “Hassan Eslaiah has been an occasional freelancer for AP and other news organisations,” a spokeswoman said. “The Associated Press had no knowledge of the October 7 attacks before they happened. The role of the AP is to gather information on breaking news events around the world, wherever they happen, even when those events are horrific and cause mass casualties.” Reuters said it was “aware of a report by Honest Reporting and accusations made against two freelance photographers who contributed to Reuters’ coverage of the October 7 attack”. “Reuters categorically denies that it had prior knowledge of the attack or that we embedded journalists with Hamas on October 7,” a spokeswoman said. “Reuters acquired photographs from two Gaza-based freelance photographers who were at the border on October 7, with whom it did not have a prior relationship. The photographs published by Reuters were taken two hours after Hamas fired rockets across southern Israel and more than 45 minutes after Israel said gunmen had crossed the border.” She added, “Reuters staff journalists were not on the ground at the locations referred to in the Honest Reporting article. Reuters is committed to delivering independent, accurate and unbiased news around the world.” The New York Timesalso hit back at the claims. “The accusation that anyone atThe New York Timeshad advance knowledge of the Hamas attacks or accompanied Hamas terrorists during the attacks is untrue and outrageous,” it said in a statement. “It is reckless to make such allegations, putting our journalists on the ground in Israel and Gaza at risk.The Timeshas extensively covered the October 7 attacks and the war with fairness, impartiality, and an abiding understanding of the complexities of the conflict.” While its photographer named in the Honest Reporting article “was not working forThe Timeson the day of the attack, he has since done important work for us”. “There is no evidence for Honest Reporting’s insinuations,” the newspaper said. “Our review of his work shows that he was doing what photojournalists always do during major news events, documenting the tragedy as it unfolded.” CNN also stressed “we had no prior knowledge of the October 7 attacks”. “Hassan Eslaiah, who was a freelance journalist working for us and many other outlets, was not working for the network on October 7,” the network said. “As of today, we have severed all ties with him.” It’s not the first time questions have been raised about western media outlets’ relationship with Gaza-based journalists and photographers. The New York Timeslast month rehired a reporter who previously came under fire for praising Adolf Hitler in multiple resurfaced Facebook posts. Palestinian filmmakerSoliman Hijjyhailed the “great” Nazi leader as recently as 2018 in a post on Facebook, theNY Postreported. ButThe Timesrehired Hijjy to cover the latest conflict. A spokesperson for the newspaper defended the decision, tellingThe Postit had “reviewed problematic social media posts by Mr Hijjy when they first came to light in 2022 and took a variety of actions to ensure he understood our concerns and could adhere to our standards if he wished to do freelance work for us in the future”. “Mr Hijjy followed those steps and has maintained high journalistic standards,” the spokesperson said. “He has delivered important and impartial work at great personal risk in Gaza during this conflict.” In 2021, APexpressed outrageafter the Gaza Strip building housing its offices there was destroyed in an Israeli air strike. The Israeli military claimed the 12-storey al-Jalaa Tower, which also hosted Al Jazeera offices, was being used by Hamas. AP said at the time it had “no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building”. ButMatti Friedman, a journalist and editor who worked in AP’s Jerusalem bureau from 2006 to 2011, contradicted his former employer, saying he had heard from “a friend who is intimately familiar with military decision-making” that “there were indeed Hamas offices there”. Friedman previously claimed in a 2014 essay forThe Atlanticthat AP staff inGaza Citywould “witness a rocket launch right beside their office, endangering reporters and other civilians nearby – and the AP wouldn’t report it”. He also alleged Hamas terrorists would regularly “burst into the AP’s Gaza bureau and threaten the staff – and the AP wouldn’t report it”. AP denied Friedman’s claims in a2014 statement, saying “his arguments have been filled with distortions, half-truths and inaccuracies, both about the recent Gaza war and more distant events”. “His suggestion of AP bias against Israel is false,” the statement said. frank.chung@news.com.au To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout The Sydney Morning Herald has banned any staff from reporting on the Gaza conflict if they signed a recent petition about media coverage of the war.

Combat rages as worst fears realised,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-fierce-streetbystreet-combat-rages-in-gaza-city/news-story/e9cc41a61392bb4ce371cfc811e4188f,"Israeli troops and Hamas were locked in heavy, close quarters fighting in Gaza City on Thursday, including a 10-hour battle that Israel said toppled one of the Palestinian militants’ “strongholds”. Hamas fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and assault rifles were clashing with Israeli soldiers backed by armoured vehicles in the ruins of the besieged territory’s north. Broken palm trees, mangled road signs and twisted lampposts marked the remains of what was once north Gaza’s main arterial route, an AFP journalist saw, while embedded with Israeli troops on a controlled visit. Israeli flags were flying over buildings at beach resorts in northern Gaza and there was little sign of any human presence amid the destruction, as hundreds of thousands have fled a dire humanitarian situation. The utter devastation is the result of over a month of war sparked by the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. On that day, gunmen from the Islamist group poured over the Gaza border with Israel and, according to Israeli officials, killed 1,400 people and seized about 240 hostages in the worst attack the country had ever suffered. Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel retaliated with an aerial bombing and ground offensive that the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip claims has killed more than 10,800 people, many of them children. Two more important medical centres, al-Rantisi Children’s Hospital and al-Nasr Hospital, have run out of fuel and shut down. ‘We don’t need you’: Israel’s fatal blunder Britain’sFinancial Timeshas publisheda new reporton the intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to catch Israel entirely off guard on October 7. It describes a patchwork of factors, significant among them a level of hubris from the IDF, which ignored warning signs. For example: Israel had been relying on volunteers to monitor communications networks in Gaza and flag any important information. One such volunteer, Menachem Gida, told theFThe’d repeatedly warned the military that Hamas fighters were conducting war games near the Gazan border. “You’re not important. We don’t need you,” an officer reportedly told him in response. A former prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, said his country had fallen prey to “overconfidence, which led to arrogance, which led to complacency”, and had enabled Hamas to “surprise” the IDF. And an unnamed senior Israeli official told the paper there had been a “fundamental flaw” in the nation’s intelligence gathering. “Even on the night of the attack, we smelled that something was happening, but the interpretation was that it was just a regular (Hamas) military exercise,” the official said. Hamas stronghold falls The Israeli military says its forces have captured a Hamas “military stronghold” in the western Jabalia area in the past day, adding that its troops “finished securing the compound after 10 hours of combat”. The battle raged above and below ground, it said, exposing some of Hamas’s extensive network of tunnels and subterranean bases, which form a significant element of the militants’ capacity to fight. Israel said dozens of militants were killed, and reported the overall death toll among its own troops in the ground offensive had risen to 34. The intense combat, coupled with the desely populated coastal territory effective being sealed off, have led to increasingly dire conditions for civilians. French President Emmanuel Macron urged nations to “work towards a ceasefire” between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, as he opened a conference on aid to the Palestinian territory in Paris. Israel won’t attend the meeting, which aims to mobilise the main players involved in the humanitarian response in the Gaza Strip. Today the Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, said its members supported a humanitarian pause. Tom Potokar, chief surgeon at the International Committee of the Red Cross, described the scene at the European hospital in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza as “catastrophic”. “In the last 24 hours, I’ve seen three patients with maggots in their wounds,” Dr Potokar said. A rare delivery of emergency medical supplies reached Gaza City’s main Al-Shifa hospital on Wednesday – just the second such delivery since the war began, the UN and World Health Organisation said, warning it was “far from sufficient to respond to the immense needs”. Thousands flee the fighting The Israeli army said 50,000 people had fled their homes in the main battle zone of northern Gaza on Wednesday, a sharp increase in numbers from earlier this week, adding to the more than 1.5 million people already seeking safety in the south of the coastal strip. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which is responsible for helping Palestinian refugees, confirmed the figure, and warned conditions were desperate in battle zones north of the central Wadi Gaza district. “Hundreds of thousands of people remaining north of Wadi Gaza, including internally displaced people, are facing a dire humanitarian situation and are struggling to secure the minimum amounts of water and food to survive.” UN rights chief Volker Turk condemned Israel over its bombardment and its orders for to Gazans to flee. “The collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians amounts also to a war crime, as does the unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians,” he told reporters at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the only route out of Gaza not controlled by Israel. An Israeli military official insisted the Gaza Strip was not in a humanitarian crisis, even as he acknowledged the Palestinian territory faces several challenges amid the ongoing war. “We know the civil situation in the Gaza Strip is not an easy one,” said Colonel Moshe Tetro, head of co-ordination and liaison at COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body handling civil affairs in Gaza. Efforts were underway to resume the crossing into Egypt of wounded Palestinians and dual nationals after departures were stalled on Wednesday, with Hamas blaming Israel for a failure to approve the list of injured to leave. More than 100 trucks carrying aid crossed into Gaza from Egypt on Wednesday, OCHA said, taking the total to 756 since fighting began last month. That is fewer than the number that would normally have entered Gaza in just two days before the war. “The aid getting through is a trickle,” Turk said. After the war Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected a ceasefire unless the 239 hostages Hamas currently holds in Gaza are released. According to a source close to Hamas, talks are underway for the release of 12 hostages, including six Americans, in return for a three-day ceasefire. The United States has backed Israel’s rejection of a ceasefire, and G7 foreign ministers in Japan said on Wednesday they supported “humanitarian pauses and corridors”. As the war intensifies, discussions on the possible future of Gaza once the conflict ends have also grown, after Mr Netanyahu this week said that Israel would assume “overall security” of the territory. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday it was plausible that, “for at least some period of time”, Israeli forces would remain in Gaza “to manage the immediate aftermath and security situation”. Israel seized Gaza in the 1967 Six-Day War and withdrew in 2005. Two years later, Hamas took control and Israel imposed a crippling blockade. In the longer term, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has suggested the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited autonomy only in parts of the occupied West Bank, should retake control of Gaza. “It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority,” Mr Blinken said on Wednesday, repeating the longstanding US call for a two-state solution. Since the war broke out, violence has also gripped the West Bank, whose health ministry said eight Palestinians were killed during an Israeli army raid on the northern city of Jenin on Thursday. Israel has confirmed its forces were operating in Jenin, but has not provided further detail. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Councillor’s death threats over Gaza vote,https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/melbourne-councillor-faces-death-threats-over-gaza-ceasefire-vote/news-story/ff80a3ebd6d8e15df2d455cfb4db0979,"A councillor in Melbourne’s inner north has revealed death threats made against himself and his family after he refused to support a motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Merri-bek councillor Oscar Yildiz was one of four councillors who voted against the motion on Wednesday condemning Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip and alleged war crimes. The two-time Mooreland City Council mayor said he had received “serious threats” as a result of the vote, which had hit him “for six” and left him barely being able to sleep. “(They’re saying) stuff about my family (and) ‘I hope the plane you’re on crashes … the Qantas plane you’re on … I’ll put something on Instagram’,” Mr Yildiz told 3AW. “They‘re saying: ‘Inshallah – so they’re saying God willing – you will die in a plane … wait until we do what the Israeli pigs are doing to our children. Wait until the next election’.” Mr Yildiz told host Neil Mitchell the alleged threats came via text messages, emails, and social media posts, and that he would on Thursday be reporting them to police. While he admitted the ongoing armed conflict in the Middle East was “gut wrenching”, Mr Yildiz said the council was not voted in to campaign on international issues. “It’s really horrific what’s going on, but how can a local council in Melbourne influence anything that is going on over there. If we could, I’d say yep – let’s vote on this,” he said. “We don’t have the power, the federal government does. I think don’t they understand the role of local government. We’re viewed as radicals, as the laughing-stock of local government. “Look at our record, time and time again were on top of the list for being one of the worst councils because we were focusing on issues that don’t concern local government.” Mr Yildiz agreed with suggestions by host Neil Mitchell that he may have been viewed as a “traitor” because of his Muslim Turkish background, but said his decision was not unusual. “What‘s even more disappointing is the fact that some of these hate messages are coming from people of Turkish background, and that’s probably the most insulting thing,” he said. “Last year, there was a motion to write a letter to the Turkish prime minister. I voted against that because what’s that got to do with local government. We can’t enforce it. “And all this motion does is it incites hatred, incite violence, and incites further waste. $15,000 is what last night’s debate cost this council. Do you really think the ratepayers are going ‘well done’.” A number of people spoke in favour of the motion on Wednesday, including Jewish woman Jordana Silverstein who called the violence in Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank “overwhelming”. “What Israel is doing right now to Palestine is devastating … The question becomes, what can we do about it. What can we do over here in Merri-bek to be helpful or useful. “All levels of government have stood against the oppression of Israelis. How do we ensure that we as people are also standing equally against the oppression of Palestinians.” The war in Gaza and ongoing allegations of war crimes has become a flashpoint for local councils across the country, including in multicultural areas of Sydney's southwest.

‘Dead men walking’: Hamas leaders cornered,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/dead-men-walking-israel-closes-in-on-hamas-leaders-as-war-in-gaza-strip-continues/news-story/70de01c04a235844e70647a4c996a342,"The former prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, has escalated his criticism of current leader Benjamin Netanyahu, calling him “Mr Bulls***” and “a danger” to the country. Mr Olmert, 78, led Israel from 2006 to 2009. Speaking to Politico, he said Mr Netanyahu had “shrunk” in the wake of Hamas’s attack on October 7. “He’s destroyed emotionally, that’s for sure. I mean, something terrible happened to him,” the former prime minister said. “Bibi has been working all his life on the false pretence that he is Mr Security. He’s Mr Bulls***. Every minute he is Prime Minister he is a danger to Israel. I seriously mean it. I am certain the Americans understand he is in bad shape.” Mr Olmert argued it would be a misguided idea to maintain control over the Gaza Strip after the current conflict. “It’s not in Israel’s interests to oversee the security of Gaza,” he said. “It is in our interests to be able to defend ourselves in a different way than we did before the October 7 attack. But to control Gaza again? No.” According to Gaza’s health ministry, which is run by Hamas, the Palestinian death toll has risen to 10,569, 4324 of whom are children. Those figures have not been independently verified. Meanwhile Israel has warned that Hamas’s leaders are “dead men walking” as it continues to scale up its operations. Hamas leaders are ‘dead men walking’ Speaking to Laura Jayes on Sky News Australia, a spokesman for the Israeli military has described Hamas’s leaders as “dead men walking”. “The mission is to engage with Hamas and simply to dismantle and each every Hamas stronghold that is buried underground in bunkers. We are doing that in slow and meticulous order, according to the plan. Our advances are good and solid,” said Jonathan Conricus. “It is a very challenging battlespace to be in. Hamas has prepared the battlefield, unfortunately, very well. And it is totally enmeshed with tunnels. Many of them short tactical tunnels that are just basically fighting positions, that allow Hamas to move from one ally to another. To emerge and then submerge. “And some are longer and deeper and wider. But we are slowly getting to all of them and there are gains achieved each day of the fight. “The directive is definitely to kill or capture all the leaders of Hamas. Those who planned, facilitated, and executed the murderous 7 October massacre in Israel. We’ve said so clearly. All of them are dead men walking. “And it’s only a matter of time inside Gaza and outside of Gaza, until these Hamas leaders will either be captured or killed by Israel.” Israel to snub humanitarian conference Israeli representatives will not participate at a “humanitarian conference” for Gaza in Paris on Thursday, which as been organised by French President Emmanuel Macron. Like other governments, Israel nevertheless has “an interest in the humanitarian situation improving in Gaza”, an official in Mr Macron’s office, who asked not to be named, told reporters. Mr Macron had spoken on Tuesday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the pair will talk again once the aid conference is over, the Elysee Palace added. The French leader had also spoken to Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. Both countries are playing a key role in attempts to bring more aid into the Gaza Strip. Thursday’s aid conference had been put together in a hurry on the sidelines of the Paris Peace Forum on November 10-11, an annual event launched by Mr Macron. Recent weeks have seen growing calls for humanitarian “pauses” or a full ceasefire to allow aid to enter Gaza and keep hopes alive of freeing the hostages. International concern over the fate of Gaza’s civilians, most of whom cannot flee the sealed-off territory, has prompted calls for a ceasefire. Sickening riches of Hamas leadership While the people of Gaza suffer,Hamas’s leaders abroad are continuing to enjoy a lifestyle of sickening riches. According to The New York Post, the terrorist group’s three top leaders alone are worth $US11 billion ($17 billion), and enjoy lives of luxury in Qater. The emirate has long welcomed the leaders of Hamas and installed them in its luxury hotels and villas at the same time as hosting a vast American military presence. Now US Congressman Andy Ogles, a Republican, is co-sponsoring a bill that would strip Hamas runs an office in Qatar’s capital, Doha, where leaders Ismail Haniyeh, Moussa Abu Marzuk, and Khaled Mashal live. Israel says Hamas leader trapped Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, has once again emphasised the nation’s determination “to destroy Hamas”. “We are in the heart of Gaza City,” Mr Gallant said. “Gaza is the largest terrorist base ever built by man. This whole city is one big terror base. Under the ground, kilometres of tunnels connect to hospitals, to schools, they are interconnected. It contains communication rooms, ammunition depots, places to sleep, and everything to serve as a base of terrorism from which the citizens of the state of Israel and IDF soldiers can be harmed.” Israel said on Tuesday its forces were operating “in the heart of Gaza City” one month after Hamas’s bloody October 7 attacks, as the campaign to crush the Palestinian militants intensifies. In a televised address from the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s military had reached deeper into Gaza than Hamas ever imagined. “In the south, the war is moving forward with force that Hamas has never seen,” he said, The Times of Israel reported. “Gaza City is surrounded. We are operating within it, we are deepening the pressure on Hamas every hour, every day.” The PM said thousands of Hamas terrorists had been killed, both above and below ground, adding the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had destroyed “countless” Hamas command centres, positions and tunnels. “Hamas is discovering that we are reaching places they thought we would never reach,” he said. – with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Who is Hamas leader ‘hiding in his bunker’?,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hamas-leader-surrounded-and-hiding-in-his-bunker-idf-says/news-story/6ccf5cedb28bbd84efd2fc32dca44eb3,"Israel said on Tuesday its forces were operating “in the heart of Gaza City” one month after Hamas’s bloody October 7 attacks, as the campaign to crush the Palestinian militants intensifies. In a televised address from the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s military had reached deeper into Gaza than Hamas ever imagined. “In the south, the war is moving forward with force that Hamas has never seen,”he said,The Times of Israelreported. “Gaza City is surrounded. We are operating within it, we are deepening the pressure on Hamas every hour, every day.” The PM said thousands of Hamas terrorists had been killed, both above and below ground, adding the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had destroyed “countless” Hamas command centres, positions and tunnels. “Hamas is discovering that we are reaching places they thought we would never reach,” he said. Hamas leader ‘in bunker’ Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, underlined the nation’s determination “to destroy Hamas”. “We are in the heart of Gaza City,” he said. “Gaza is the largest terrorist base ever built by man. This whole city is one big terror base. Under the ground, kilometres of tunnels connect to hospitals, to schools, they are interconnected. It contains communication rooms, ammunition depots, places to sleep, and everything to serve as a base of terrorism from which the citizens of the state of Israel and IDF soldiers can be harmed.” Mr Gallant added that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar “is hiding in his bunker and is without contact with his associates”, although he did not say where the bunker was located. He stressed “there will be no humanitarian truce without the return of the hostages”. Mr Netanyahu also said there would be no fuel delivered to Gaza and no ceasefire in Israel’s fighting with Hamas unless the more than 240 hostages seized by the Palestinian militants are freed. “There will not be a ceasefire without the return of our kidnapped,” he said, adding the message was for “our enemies and our friends alike”. The PM also issued a stark warning to Hezbollah in Lebanon which, like Hamas, is backed by Iran. “If Hezbollah makes the choice of joining the war it will be making the mistake of its life,” he said. IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel had struck more than 14,000 targets in the Gaza Strip and destroyed more than 100 tunnel entrances. “Hamas terrorists tell themselves that there will be a ceasefire,” he said. “There won’t be one. We are moving forward.” The comments came as the IDF released new intelligence on Sunday it claimed provided further evidence Hamas was using hospitals for terror purposes. Who is Yahya Sinwar? The 61-year-old, dubbed Israel’s most wanted and called a “dead man walking” by Mr Netanyahu, orchestrated the terror group’s October 7 massacre alongsideMohammed Deif, the head of Hamas’ military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. Sinwar is one of the founding members of the Hamas and its leader within the Gaza Strip, after being secretly elected to that role in 2017. Ismail Haniyeh, who lives in Qatar, is generally considered Hamas’overall leader. In the 1980s he founded Majd, Hamas’ internal security organisation and “police” force tasked with tracking Israeli agents. Sinwar has been arrested three times and after his third arrest in 1988 was sentenced to four life terms in prison for the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. He spent 23 years behind bars before being released in 2011 as the most senior of more than 1000 prisoners swapped for kidnapped Israeli soldierGilad Shalit— the highest price ever paid by the Jewish state for the release of one man. Shalit was captured in 2006 as a 19-year-old corporal and spent five years in Hamas captivity in Gaza. Upon his release, Sinwar said the experience had taught him kidnapping Israeli soldiers was the only way to free Palestinian prisoners,The Guardianreported. In 2015, the US government added Sinwar to its blacklist of “specially designated global terrorists”. “He is considered to be one of the most senior and prominent prisoners to be exchanged, and has called on militants to capture more Israeli soldiers,” the US State Department said at the time. According to a former interrogator, while in prison Sinwar refused to talk to any Israelis and personally punished those who did, once pushing a person’s face into a makeshift stove. “He’s 1000 per cent committed and 1000 per cent violent, a very, very hard man,” the interrogator toldThe Guardian. One month milestone Tuesday was a day of commemoration in Israel to mark the grim one-month milestone. Sobs pierced memorial ceremonies and crowds lit candles while mourning the 1400 dead, including families slain in their homes and young people killed at a music festival, in Israel’s worst attack since its 1948 founding. Israel has vowed to destroy the Islamist militants over their shock attack, launching a campaign in the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 10,300 people, mostly civilians, said the Palestinian territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. “There’s not one person not impacted by these horrible attacks,” said 52-year-old Sharon Balaban, one of thousands of Israelis who attended sorrowful memorial events. “Everyone knows somebody who was hurt, killed, murdered or impacted.” US opposes Gaza occupation Despite growing calls for a ceasefire, Mr Netanyahu has made clear there will not be one unless the hostages are freed. He has said Israel would assume “overall security” in Gaza after the war ends, while allowing for possible “tactical pauses” before then to free captives and deliver aid to the besieged territory of 2.4 million people. However, Washington said on Tuesday it opposed a new long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel. “Our viewpoint is that Palestinians must be at the forefront of these decisions and Gaza is Palestinian land and it will remain Palestinian land,” said State Department spokesman Vedant Patel. “Generally speaking, we do not support the reoccupation of Gaza and neither does Israel.” Israel withdrew from the territory, which it captured in the 1967 Six-Day War, in 2005. On Tuesday UN human rights chief Volker Turk called the month that followed the attack one marked by “carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair”. Since the attack, Israel has relentlessly hammered Gaza with more than 12,000 air and artillery strikes and sent in ground forces that have effectively cut it in half. ‘Moral failing’ It has air-dropped leaflets and sent texts ordering civilians in northern Gaza to flee south, but a US official said Saturday at least 350,000 civilians remained in the worst-hit areas. Clutching one of her toddlers, Amira al-Sakani recounted how she left Gaza City after coming across the air-dropped Israeli flyers. On the way, Ms Sakani said she saw “bodies of martyrs, some in pieces, people abandoning their cars and cattle to walk”. “Our life is tragic,” she said. “We don’t want war … we want peace.” The suffering in Gaza has been immense, with entire city blocks levelled and bodies in white shrouds piling up outside hospitals where surgeons operate on bloodied floors by the light of phones. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said an average of 160 children are killed every day in Gaza by the war. “The level of death and suffering is hard to fathom,” WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which said one of its humanitarian convoys in Gaza was hit by gunfire on Tuesday, demanded an end to the suffering of civilians, especially children. “Children have been ripped from their families and held hostage. In Gaza, ICRC surgeons treat toddlers whose skin is charred from widespread burns,” the organisation’s president Mirjana Spoljaric said. “This is a moral failing,” she added. Military analysts warned of weeks of gruelling house-to-house fighting ahead in Gaza. “Hamas has had 15 years to prepare a dense ‘defence in depth’ that integrates subterranean, ground-level and above-ground fortifications,” said Michael Knights of the Washington Institute think-tank. The operation is hugely complicated for Israel because of the hostages, including very young children and frail elderly people, who are believed to be held inside a tunnel network spanning hundreds of kilometres. Israel’s top ally, the United States, has backed it in its war on Hamas, but also urged restraint and facilitated some aid deliveries and the flight of several hundred refugees with second passports through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. ‘Little pauses’ Mr Patel, the US State Department spokesman, said “more than 400 US citizens” have now left Gaza through Rafah. Hundreds of Palestinians who hold foreign passports waited on Tuesday in Gaza to leave. While most still queued nervously, the first arrivals were seen on the Egyptian side where paramedics transferred an injured woman on a stretcher into an ambulance. Tuesday was the fifth day Gaza’s sole land crossing not controlled by Israel has opened in the past week, to wounded Palestinians, foreigners and Palestinian dual nationals. Mr Netanyahu told ABC News on Monday the war would continue until Israel had restored overall control of Gaza. “Israel will, for an indefinite period … have the overall security responsibility,” he said. “When we don’t have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn’t imagine.” He stressed that “there will be no ceasefire — general ceasefire — in Gaza, without the release of our hostages”. “As far as tactical, little pauses — an hour here, an hour there — we’ve had them before,” he said. “I suppose we’ll check the circumstances in order to enable goods — humanitarian goods — to come in or our hostages, individual hostages, to leave.” US diplomacy Around 30 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the offensive, the latest on Monday, according to a report from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing Israeli sources. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after a Middle East tour of crisis diplomacy, was in Tokyo on Tuesday for a meeting of G7 foreign ministers set to seek a common line on Gaza as calls mount for a ceasefire. In the occupied West Bank on Sunday, he suggested the Palestinian Authority under president Mahmud Abbas should retake control. Mr Abbas said the PA could return to power in Gaza in the future only if a “comprehensive political solution” is found for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Grim milestone in horrific Gaza conflict,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/no-palestinian-spokesmans-shocking-answer-to-question-about-israelhamas-conflict/news-story/5e88a1d9ed0a22b9d2b713db36f8af75,"The bloody Israel-Hamas conflict has entered its fifth week and fears are growing of a broader war in the Middle East as tensions in the region rise. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken made a surprise high-security visit to the West Bank, meeting with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Meanwhile, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Kingdom has refused to formally condemn Hamas’ bloody 7 October attacks on Israel and instead slammed America for failing to be an “honest mediator” in the war. Follow on for our latest updates throughout the day. 10,000 dead in Gaza Hamas-run health ministry in Palestine has said the Gaza death toll has surged past 10,000. Resisting calls for a ceasefire, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there would be no letup in the war to destroy Hamas, whose October 7 attack left 1,400 dead in Israel, most of them civilians. The Palestinian militant group also took more than 240 people hostage, including children and elderly people, in an attack that prompted Israel’s massive bombardment of Gaza and an intensifying ground offensive. One month since the war began, the Hamas-run health ministry said the death toll in Gaza had surpassed 10,000 people -- more than 4,000 of them children. With international criticism of Israel’s conduct of the war mounting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Gaza was becoming a “graveyard for children”. More than 1.5 million people in densely packed Gaza have fled their homes for other parts of the territory in a desperate search for cover, with critical aid only trickling in. But Netanyahu told ABC News the war would continue until Israel had restored “overall security” control of Gaza. ‘Closing in’: Israel surrounds Gaza City Israeli Defence Forces are preparing for the “significant next phase” of their operation to destroy Hamas, having encircled Gaza City in preparation for a full-scale assault. In the past hour, bombing of the Gaza Strip has intensified and Associated Press journalist on the ground report signs the IDF is ready to move in. Ground troops reached the Mediterranean overnight, surrounding the city, while the Air Force carried out one of the most intense bombing barrages seen so far, hitting hundreds of targets, IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht said. “We countered, we contained and now we’re slowly closing in,” he told the media. More than 450 targets were hit by air strikes in the past day, from Hamas military compounds to antitank missile positions. The assault is coming from land, air and sea, with the Israeli Navy positioned in the Mediterranean Sea also firing on Hamas positions overnight. An Israeli Government spokesperson last night toldThe Wall Street Journalthat an air strike had killed Hamas commander Wael Asefa, who it called “personally responsible” for orchestrating the 7 October massacres. The IDF has bombed portions of two bridges leading into Gaza and seized control of the main thoroughfare into the city. Yesterday, the IDF said it would carry out a “significant next phase” of the ground operation within the next 48 hours. Gaza City is a Hamas stronghold controlled by militant fighters, but a huge number of civilians also remain in the region. US President Joe Biden spoke again with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier and the pair discussed “the possibility of tactical pauses to provide civilians with opportunities to safely depart from areas of ongoing fighting”, the White House said. Air strikes overnight hit areas close to Gaza’s largest health facility, Al-Shifa Hospital, where thousands of patients are being treated and scores more civilians are sheltering. The IDF claims Hamas is running military commands and keeping weapons stockpiles beneath hospitals, which the militant group denies. More than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed in the past month, the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza reported. Most are women and children, it added. The United Nations has said its shelters n Gaza are so overrun that it can’t count the number of people in need of water, food and medicines. “It is a terrible, terrible situation,” a UN official told The Guardian. “There is no room even to sleep on the floor. There is one toilet for 700 or 800 people. No bread, no stoves for cooking. We are drinking irrigation water.” Mr Netanyahu continues to resist calls for a broad humanitarian ceasefire unless some 240 Israeli hostages, held captive by Hamas, are released. ‘Indefinite’: Netanyahu’s plan for Gaza Israel plans to take “indefinite” control of Gaza at the end of its war with Hamas, the country’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has revealed. In a television interview with ABC News in the US, Mr Netanyahu said he intends to maintain a long-term military presence in the Gaza Strip. “Israel will, for an indefinite period, have the overall security responsibility,” he said. “When we don’t have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn’t imagine.” Last month, US President Joe Biden warned against Israel permanently occupying Gaza. Israeli TV show bags Western lefties A sketch comedy show on Israeli television has taken aim at “Western liberals” it accuses of being hypocrites for supporting a cause that doesn’t align with their values. The latest episode of Eretz Nehederet, which airs in primetime on Channel 2,features a lengthy skitfeaturing two university students, blue-fringed Wordle and pink-haired Kelcy, hosting a YouTube news show. “Welcome to Columbia Untisemity,” she says, while he waves a merged Palestine and rainbow flag. Kelcy declares that everyone on campus is welcome, including “LGBTQH” – the H for Hamas added to the acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer. Homosexuality is a crime punishable by death in Gaza. “I totally simp Hamas – it’s so trending right now,” Wordle says, before adding, “I major in queer post-colonial astrology.” He comments that “Jews make the world dirty” in a reference to a medical student at the University of Warsaw who was suspended for holding a placard at a pro-Palestine process that read “keep the world clean” alongside an image of the Star of David being put in a rubbish bin. “And no, I’m not antisemitic, I’m racist fluid,” Wordle adds. The pair cross live to the character of a Hamas fighter in Gaza and tell him: “I love your head piece – the whole oppression chic. Very drip.” The terrorist insists he’s safe “in a tunnel under a hospital” with “two million civilians above protecting me” to which the female character replies that “community is important these days”. When Wordle says he wishes he could be there in Gaza, the terrorist character replies: “You can come to Gaza anytime and we will throw you from the roof, you homosexual dirt.” Wordle gushes: “Do you hear that? They want to throw me a rooftop party.” To which Kelcy replies: “They are so welcoming and inclusive.” Hate crimes on the rise in America An elderly Jewish man allegedly hit in the hit with a megaphone by a pro-Palestinian protester in Los Angeles has died in hospital. A statement from the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles confirmed the man named Paul succumbed to his injuries on Monday local time. The protest took place in Westlake Village on Sunday. “While we wait for more information from our law enforcement partners, we remind you that this is the fourth major antisemitic crime committed in Los Angeles this year alone,” the statement read. “Violence against our people has no place in civilized society. We demand safety. We will not tolerate violence against our community. We will do everything in our power to prevent it.” Meanwhile, a Muslim student at Stanford University is in hospital after being allegedly struck by a motorist in a hit-and-run incident. The student is being treated for non-life-threatening injuries. “The driver is reported to have made eye contact with the victim, accelerated and struck the victim and then driven away while shouting ‘f*** you and your people’ out the lowered window of the vehicle,” Stanford’s Department of Public Safety said. Police are investigating. Video shows Hamas fighters in hospitals, Israel says Israel has released vision it says proves Hamas militants are hiding within and beneath major hospitals in Gaza, despite staunch denials. Intelligence provided to journalists by Israeli Defence Forces spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari purports to show a tunnel under Sheikh Hamad Hospital. Other vision appears to show fighters firing on Israeli ground forces from within the hospital building itself, he said. “We decided to declassify and share more sensitive intelligence with you, because the world must take immediate action. He said the evidence proves “Hamas systematically exploits hospitals as part of its war machine”. The IDF has repeatedly said in recent weeks that the terrorist group uses civilians in Gaza as “human shields”. Rear Admiral Hagari said the video shows an entrance to a tunnel under the Sheikh Hamad Hospital, connecting to a sophisticated network that runs for hundreds of kilometres beneath Gaza. “If it weren’t enough that we exposed a tunnel under the hospital, the terrorists also shot at our soldiers from within the hospital,” he said. The hospital’s construction was funded by the Qatari Government, which provides direct support to Hamas and hosts some of its senior leaders. The IDF claimed another health facility, named the Indonesian Hospital, is also being used by fighters. At the press conference, Rear Admiral Hagari also played audio recordings of Hamas officials discussing the seizure of fuel from the hospital. “This is the murderous organisation we are dealing with. Hamas doesn’t even try to hide it. They say it loud and clear.” The operator of the Indonesian Hospital rubbished the claims Hamas was using its facility. “We built this hospital to help others, according to the needs of the Gazans,” Sarbini Abdul Murad, chairperson of MER-C group, said at a press conference in Jakarta. “Israel‘s accusation is a precondition so that they can attack the Indonesian hospital in Gaza.” Qatar also slammed the accusation, saying it is “without any tangible evidence or independent investigation”. “This is a blatant attempt to justify the occupation‘s targeting of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, residential areas, and shelters for displaced people,” Ambassador Mohammed El Emadi, chairperson of the Qatari Committee for the Reconstruction of Gaza, said in a statement. Protesters occupy Statue of Liberty Hundreds of Jewish people have occupied the Statue of Liberty in New York, calling for an immediate ceasefire in what they called Israel’s “genocidal bombardment” of Gaza. Wearing black T-shirts bearing the words “not in our name” and “Jews demand ceasefire now”, the group unfurled a banner at the base of the iconic statue. It read: “The whole world is watching”. Organiser Jay Saper from the group Jewish Voice for Peace quoted the poem “New Colossus” by Emma Lazarus, inscribed on the bottom of the Statue of Liberty, in honour of immigrants to the United States. “The famous words of our Jewish ancestor Emma Lazarus etched into this very monument compel us to take action supporting the Palestinians of Gaza yearning to breathe free,” Mr Saper said. Some two million Jews call New York home. The city has played host to countless protests in recent week, some of which have been marred by violent clashes. Israel finds Hamas rockets in civilian buildings Israeli soldiers on the Ground in Gaza have uncovered and destroyed several missile facilities within civilian buildings, including one in a mosque. The Israeli Defence Forces released vision showing troops raiding a youth centre where rocket launchers were positioned against windows. Soldiers also found and destroyed 50 rockets in the building, the IDF said in a statement. ‘Kill him’: Sydney Muslim cleric’s sick sermon A Sydney Islamic centre is facing renewed criticism for hosting an alarming sermon by a prominent local cleric who spoke of Muslims killing Jews. On Sunday, The Australian newspaper revealed a Muslim preacher called Brother Ismail spoke at the Al Madina Dawah Centre in the wake of Hamas massacres in Israel on 7 October and described the terrorists as “freedom fighters”. He described “jihad” as the “solution” and referenced the al-Qaeda flag, while warning that Australia’s “national security system” could be tested by people here “labelling Muslims as terrorists”. “There is no other way [than jihad] … they (Muslims) are looking forward to joining the mujahideen,” he said in his address. Now, it’s been revealed the Islamic centre had uploaded a similarly inflammatory sermon delivered at the weekend by its leader Abu Ousayd. “Towards the end of times, when the Muslims will be fighting the Jews, the trees will speak,” Ousayd said, quoting Islamic scripture. “They will say: ‘Oh Muslim, there is a yahud [Arabic for Jew] behind me – come and kill him’.” He went on to say that Jewish people had “hands everywhere in business” and use their “wealth to gain authority over the weak”. “Jews own the majority of banks, who are happy to give the most oppressive interest loans to people in need, knowing that they are impossible to pay back.” Yesterday, the Al Madina Dawah Centre told reporters it stood by Ismail’s comments. The Federal Government said intelligence series are monitoring extremist language in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Federal MP Jason Clare, whose electorate takes in the Islamic centre, told The Australian: “I condemn these remarks – there’s no place for hate in Australia.” Jihad Dib, the state MP for Bankstown, told the newspaper there’s “a responsibility on all of us to use language that unites rather than divides”. US officials sign ‘dissent memo’ A number of State Department officials in the United States have signed a memo demanding the Biden Administration publicly condemn Israel’s actions in its conflict with Hamas in Gaza. The letter, obtained and published by the website Politico, indicates a growing loss of confidence among mid- and low-level diplomats. “We must publicly criticise Israel’s violations of international norms such as failure to limit offensive operations to legitimate military targets,” it reads. “When Israel supports settler violence and illegal land seizures or employs excessive use of force against Palestinians, we must communicate publicly that this goes against our American values so that Israel does not act with impunity.” Politico notes the memo – marked “sensitive but unclassified” – was submitted to the State Department’s so-called Dissent Channel, where employees can freely voice policy positions. It’s unclear how many staffers signed it. The memo said that a gap between America’s public stance and its words in private with key players in the conflict “contributes to regional public perceptions that the United States is a biased and dishonest actor, which at best does not advance, and at worst harms, US interests worldwide.” The State Department has not commented on the emergence of the letter. Last month, the department’s spokesperson Matthew Miller said: “One of the strengths of this department is that we do have people with different opinions. We encourage them to make their opinions known.” US sending hundreds of millions worth of weapons The United States is planning to send US$320 million (AU$492 million) worth of precision-guided missiles to Israel, according to reports. The Wall Street Journal said it has viewed correspondence from the White House sent to Congress, notifying it about a transfer of a cache of SPICE Family Gliding Bomb Assemblies. Those kits allow militaries to turn unguided bombs into GPS-guided weapons that are more precise. A second report in The New York Times also confirms the deal. Israel has previously ordered the same equipment in a deal worth more than US$400 million (AU$616 million). Rafael Advanced Defence Systems, which manufactures the weapons, describes them as “next-gen precision guided munition with an advanced data link and a stand-off range of 100km”. They are “capable of hitting stationary, relocatable and moving targets on land and at sea” and have “high lethality and low collateral damage”, the company said. “The SPICE Family is part of today’s essential mix of aircraft weaponry. Incorporating the most advanced navigation, guidance and homing technologies ‒ together with a remarkable scene-matching algorithm and GPS-independence ‒ they enable autonomous, multiple, precision, high-volume attacks from the safety of significantly extended stand-off ranges.” Labor slams Greens over walkout Bill Shorten has slammed Greens politicians who stage a walkout in the Senate yesterday in protest over the Israel-Hamas conflict. Speaking on the ABC this morning, Mr Shorten said the move doesn’t “help a single soul anywhere” and is “just political grand-standing”. During Question Time yesterday, Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi called the Coalition “morally corrupt” and Labor “cowards” for refusing to condemn the deaths of Palestinian civilians during Israeli military operations in Gaza. Senator Faruqi said she was bringing “the people’s protest” in Parliament, as she and her Greens colleagues left the chamber. Greens Senator Janet Rice held up a picture of the Palestinian flag during the walkout. “You know, with the Greens – they don‘t walk out over Hamas, so I think that these guys are opportunists,” Mr Shorten said today. “We want to make sure that we are supporting the humanitarian pause. We want to see relief get through to innocent Palestinian civilians.” ‘I beg you to stop’ Pope Francis has issued another plea for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, decrying “serious situation” that has seen “many, many people lose their lives”. The Pontif took to X, formerly Twitter, where he wrote: “I continue to think about the serious situation in Palestine and in Israel where many, many people have lost their lives. In God’s name, I beg you to stop: cease using weapons! I hope that avenues will be pursued so that an escalation of the conflict might be absolutely avoided.” It comes after the Vatican confirmed the Pope spoke with Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday. Speaking to gathered crowds in St Peter’s Square yesterday, Pope Francis also called for the release of hundreds of Israeli hostages, held captive in Gaza by Hamas. In recent weeks, he has held phone discussions with US President Joe Biden, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Inside the luxe life of Hamas billionaires An estimated 1.5 million Palestinians have been displaced since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict a month ago, while hundreds of thousands are crammed into makeshift refugee camps and shelters. But even before the bloody battle unfolded, life in Gaza for most people was a grim reality. With an unemployment rate of about 40 per cent, basic facilities like electricity and running water seen as a luxury, and strict controls on the movements of ordinary people outside the territory, the vast majority of Gazans live in abject poverty. Except for the leader of the terrorist group Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, whose family has an estimated fortune of US$2.5 billion (AU$3.85 billion). Haniyeh, 61, runs the militant group from a luxury six-star hotel in Doha in Qatar, regularly travelling by private jet to Iran, Russia, Egypt and Turkey to shore up support and raise money. As well as military preparedness and internal power dynamics, he oversees the growth of the Hamas investment portfolio, from which he and his family benefit greatly. “Hamas has generated vast sums of revenue through its secret investment portfolio while destabilising Gaza, which is facing harsh living and economic conditions,” US Treasury official Elizabeth Rosenberg has said in the past. Israel’s Embassy in the US claims Hamas has a yearly financial turnover of US$1 billion (AU$1.54 billion). Haniyeh’s son Maaz – one of 13 children – is a major property owner in Gaza, where locals refer to him as the “father of houses”. When outside the Strip, Maaz can reportedly often be found in nightclubs in Turkey, drinking alcohol and partying with a bevy of models – contrary to the practices of Islam. His father is also an avid property mogul, paying $4 million in 2010 for a compound on the beachfront in Gaza near a crowded refugee camp, according to Egyptian magazine Rose al-Yusuf. Haniyeh has bought more than a dozen villas and apartments, as well as whole residential buildings, since then. Most are registered in the names of his adult children, the Times of Israel reports. While Haniyeh is rarely in Gaza, his sons visit often to exert their power and flaunt their wealth, travelling via limousine in a place where few own cars. But Maaz has reportedly obtained a Turkish passport, allowing him to freely leave and travel widely abroad. He has also invested in real estate there. Other figures in Hamas have grown their financial positions greatly in recent years, with German newspaper Bild reporting senior leaders Khaled Mashal, Abu Marzouk and Younis Qafisheh worth billions. As well as siphoning money from wealthy supporters like Qatar, Hamas imposes steep taxes on businesses operating in Gaza. For every load of goods smuggled through its vast tunnel network, which stretches into Egypt, a flat levy of US$2000 (AU$3080) is applied, plus 25 per cent of the value of items. In 2021, per capita GDP in Gaza was US$5600 (AU$8620) annually, ranking it one of the poorest places in the whole world. Gaza becoming ‘a graveyard for children’ United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has delivered a grim assessment of the situation on the ground in Gaza, warning “no-one is safe”. During a briefing at the UN headquarters in New York overnight, Mr Guterres said the conflict has created “more than a humanitarian crisis – it is a crisis of humanity” and repeated calls for an urgent ceasefire. Increasing ground offensives and relentless air strikes carried out by the Israeli Defence Forces have targeted hospitals, UN facilities, shelters, churches and mosques, and refugee camps, resulting in a significant loss of civilian life, he said. As a result, Mr Guterres solemnly declared that Gaza is “becoming a graveyard for children”. “I’m deeply concerned about the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing. Let me be clear, no party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law.” He said the safety of civilians in the region “must be paramount”. ‘No’: Palestinian spokesman’s shocking answer A top Palestinian ambassador has refused to formally condemn Hamas’ bloody, surprise attack on Israel and instead called on the US to “empower the state of Palestine that will be able to protect its people.” In an interview on CBS News’Face The Nationon Sunday, anchor Margaret Brennan pointed to the Israeli government’s withholding of some tax revenues after it claimed the Palestinian Authority has not condemned Hamas adequately and the group’s 7 October massacres that left hundreds of civilians dead. Pressed by Ms Brennan on if he wants to condemn Hamas and its attacks, Palestinian ambassador to the United Kingdom, Husam Zomlot, responded, “No”. Dr Zomlot added that he wanted to “clear the record”, specifying his role and the authorities of the Palestinian Authority and the PLO as they pertain to that role, and that the role of the United States in the conflict should be as “peacemaker.” Ms Brennan asked again about the Hamas attack, saying, “Do you want to clear the air and condemn it?” The ambassador again dodged the question and demanded the United States “de-designate” the PLO as a terrorist organisation. When Ms Brennan asked a third time, Dr Zomlot deflected again. On her fourth attempt, Ms Brennan reiterated that “on that specific condemnation it would just be a very quick answer.” Again, Dr Zomlot specifically answered, “No.” Dr Zomlot went on to say that he does not consider the conflict to be a war, because “a war does not happen between the occupied and an occupier” and “only happens between two sovereign states.” During the interview, he also slammed the US for failing to be an “honest mediator” in the Israel-Hamas war after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. “We need to see the US playing the role of an honest mediator, not adopting the Israeli narrative,” the ambassador said. Hamas says Gaza death toll tops 10,000 The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 10,000 people, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said, after a month of bombardment by Israel, whose offensive against militants shows signs of intensifying. Determined to destroy Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed no let-up despite mounting calls for a ceasefire. Hundreds of overnight strikes pushed the death toll in Gaza to 10,022, mostly women and children, a spokesman for the health ministry told a press conference. Two pediatric hospitals and Gaza’s only psychiatric hospital were hit, the ministry said, after the director of another hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza reported he had counted 58 dead. “These are massacres! They destroyed three houses over the heads of their inhabitants — women and children,” one resident, Mahmud Meshmesh, told AFP. “We have already taken 40 bodies out of the rubble,” he said as crowds prayed around corpses wrapped in white shrouds. The Israeli military accuses Hamas of building tunnels underneath hospitals, schools and places of worship in Gaza to hide fighters, store arms and ammunition, and plan attacks — charges the militant group has denied. Ground forces with tanks have flooded the northern half of the Gaza Strip and tightened an encirclement of Gaza City, effectively splitting the territory in two. Israel’s ally the United States sent its top diplomat Antony Blinken on a whirlwind Middle East tour that wrapped up on Monday in Turkey, where again his host pressed for an Israeli ceasefire, which Washington has declined to endorse. The heads of major United Nations agencies issued a joint statement also calling for a ceasefire inside the territory of 2.4 million people where an Israeli siege has cut off most water, food and fuel supplies. “It’s been 30 days. Enough is enough. This must stop now,” the statement said. The Israeli army said on Monday it had pounded Gaza with “significant” strikes on 450 targets, having said last week it had already hit over 12,000. It also reported seizing a Hamas command post and killing a Hamas commander accused of helping organise the October 7 attacks and planning future incursions. “We will take the fight to Hamas wherever they are — underground, above ground,” Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said, referring to Hamas tunnels, and repeating calls for civilians to leave the urban war zone. “We will be able to dismantle Hamas, stronghold after stronghold, battalion after battalion, until we achieve the ultimate goal, which is to rid the Gaza Strip — the entire Gaza Strip — of Hamas.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Soldier accused of shooting Afghan farmer,https://www.news.com.au/national/courts-law/national-security-concerns-over-exsas-soldier-charged-with-war-crime/news-story/f3542d8cda0a5d6376820fa0232f2d2d,"A former elite Australian soldier accused of committing a war crime will have to wrestle with national security laws before he is able to see a full brief of evidence against him. Oliver Schulz has been charged with committing a war crime by murdering a civilian while he was deployed in Afghanistan with the Australian Defence Force. The Australian Federal Police allege the 41-year-old fatally shot Dad Mohammad, a father and struggling farmer, in a wheat field in Uruzgan Province in May 2012. Mr Schulz, a former Special Air Services soldier, is the first Australian serviceman or veteran to be charged with a war crime under Australian law. He was not required to appear in Sydney Downing Centre Court on Tuesday as it was told there would be further delays in receiving the brief of evidence of his alleged crime. A lawyer for the Australian government told the court the evidence touched on “sensitive national security information”. He explained the court would need to make orders under the National Security Information Act to allow the information to be released. Mr Schulz’s lawyer Karen Espiner noted the defence and prosecution were likely to agree to the orders but said the court needed to “independently satisfy itself on the matters”. She urged the court to set the matter down as soon as possible, as she “remained concerned” about further delays for her client. “There are parts of the brief that can’t be served until these orders are in place,” Ms Espiner stressed. Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson agreed the matter needed to proceed “as quickly as possible”. She determined the national security information issues would be discussed in a hearing before the end of the year. The allegations against Mr Schultz were first aired in March 2020 when Four Corners broadcast footage from Afghanistan and he was suspended from the ADF. Mr Schulz was arrested in March and granted bail by Ms Atkinson after she found he was at risk of being targeted in prison. The former soldier’s lawyer argued his client was at “grave risk” of being attacked in jail by Islamic extremists and inmates who were ideologically opposed to the war in Afghanistan. Mr Schulz was released on bail under strict conditions, including that he surrender a $200,000 surety and not leave his home between 10pm and 5am. He must also report to police daily, not communicate with any witnesses, hand over his passport, and provide officers with access to his phone.",
Arrests as 100 protesters spark Cup chaos,https://www.news.com.au/sport/superracing/melbourne-cup/propalestine-protesters-cause-chaos-outside-melbourne-cup/news-story/ea422106eca583073cb3e275190b8373,"A group of pro-Palestine protesters have blocked a major intersection outside Flemington Racecourse on Melbourne Cup Day. Chaos unfolded just outside Flemington when a van with the words “Free Palestine” spray painted on the side began to block traffic, joined by dozens of people who sat down in the middle of the busy intersection. Police were seen dragging protesters along the ground before arresting them. Victoria Police said they were “dealing” with about 100 protesters who began blocking the roundabout of Epsom Rd, Ascot Vale Rd and Racecourse Rd at about 11am. A lone protester stood with a lit flare on top of the stationary van, leading the group in chants denouncing the treatment of those in Gaza. They were heard chanting “free Palestine and ”shame Israel”. Others held signs that said “From Naarm to Gaza, we stand united”. The woman who had climbed onto the van has since been arrested after police say she “failed to obey police instructions to come down”. Police also sprayed two other “non-compliant protesters” before arresting them. Buses and cars were left at a standstill while the group continued their protest, with one vehicle seen trying to push through the crowd. Police were seen issuing an order to move on, which was largely ignored by the protesters who continued to chant. Victoria Police have been contacted for comment. The protest comes just one day after a similar group of activists shut down part of Melbourne Central for a “die in”. A group of people were seen lying down in the heart of the shopping centre calling for a ceasefire. Tuesday marks one month since Gaza was first hit on October 7 in retaliation to an unprecedented surprise attack from Hamas on parts of Israel. Dozens of Israelis were taken hostage in the siege, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing no ceasefire would take place unless they are released. More than 10,000 people from the Gaza have been killed in the past four week, with 1,400 Israelis killed in the same period. Protests have erupted around the world in support of Palestine, with groups in each continent calling for a ceasefire. More to come A man’s life has changed forever, checking his account after the Melbourne Cup to see a six-figure payment sitting there. Channel 7 is under fire over two missing words that saw Aussies all fall into the same trap on Melbourne Cup day. While most Melbourne Cup punters have gone home with nothing, one lucky Western Australian as turned a gold coin to a small fortune.",
Chilling 737 moment over Israel,https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/horror-moment-boeing-737-passenger-jet-flies-past-iron-dome-blasts-as-it-comes-into-land-in-israel-during-rocket-blitz/news-story/15ca015a0a1e5614c9975fe3e628bf65,"A Boeing 737 passenger jet seems to fly into Israel at the exact moment the powerful Iron Dome air defence system blasts terror rockets out of the sky. The clips show four bright explosions, believed to be Israel defensive missiles coming from theIron Dome, near the plane as it lands at Tel Aviv airport,The Sunreports. Four rockets can be seen shooting into the sky, presumably aiming forHamas terror rockets. Two of the rockets suddenly explode as the Boeing 737 passes underneath. The chilling sound of warning sirens can be heard in the background as the missiles soar through the air. The flight, believed to be an El Al LY5108 plane from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Tel Aviv, arrived 15 minutes late, according to flight radar data. The Sun has reached out to the airport and El Al for comment. Tel Aviv had been hit by a brutal night of heavy aerial strikes on October 5, in the hours leading up to the video. According to reports, more than 7,000 rockets have been launched towards Israel since the October 7 massacre kicked off the brutal war. To combat the horror attacks, Israel designed their own rocket defence back in 2011, that has helped to stop several Hamas attacks. The Iron Dome is the first missile interceptor of its kind in the world, and is said to have a 90 per cent success rate at bringing down threats. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defence Systems, it can be operated in all weather conditions including fog, dust storm, low clouds and rain. The dome is made up of missile batteries which are shaped like giant match boxes and are tilted in the direction of Gaza. The special monitor detects a target using radar technology and tracks its trajectory before sending off a rocket hit the threat and explode in the air. Once the rockets collide they’ll explode in the air and neutralise any threat to the public. Brits were given a chilling warning this week to not travel to Lebanon amid growing tensions in the region as the war between Hamas and Israel worsens. The Foreign Office has also evacuated its staff from its embassy in Lebanon as the “risk of civil unrest” ramps up. Back in October, British Airways suspended all flights to and from Israel after one of its planes was forced to turn back. The top airline said the decision was made due to safety concerns after Hamas rockets appeared to be targeting Tel Aviv airport. In a statement British Airways said: “Safety is always our highest priority and following the latest assessment of the situation we’re suspending our flights to and from Tel Aviv. “We’re contacting customers booked to travel to or from Tel Aviv to apologise for the inconvenience... We continue to monitor the situation in the region closely.” Virgin Atlantic also cancelled their flights for three days after the worrying events. In the past 36 hours, 450 Hamas targets in Gaza were struck by Israeli fighter jets as Israel continues its bombardment of enclave in retaliation for the massacre. Israel said its troops had also seized a militant compound and blasted hit “tunnels, terrorists, military compounds, observation posts, and anti-tank missile launch posts” Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said: “We will take the fight to Hamas wherever they are - underground, above ground. “We will be able to dismantle Hamas, stronghold after stronghold, battalion after battalion, until we achieve the ultimate goal, which is to rid the Gaza Strip - the entire Gaza Strip - of Hamas” But it is feared Hamas terrorists are attempting to draw Israeli troops into prepared so-called “kill-zones”.

Drama as Senators stage Gaza walkout,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/drama-as-senators-stage-gaza-walkout-over-refusal-to-call-for-ceasefire/news-story/f96d5c8c7337bbc547f4f598adc33e73,"Chants to “free Palestine” have echoed out in the Senate chamber as the government continued to reject demands it call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Draped in a keffiyeh, Mehreen Faruqi, was flanked by her Greens colleagues as they staged the question time walkout on Monday afternoon. The Greens deputy leader had used her question to lash Labor for not listening to the thousands who marched on the weekend across Australia in support of a ceasefire. Acting leader of the government in the Senate, Don Farrell, said Labor stood by Israel’s right to defend itself but reiterated the way it responds “matters”. “This means that Israel must observe international law and the rules of law,” he said. “Nobody wants to see innocent lives lost in this terrible set of circumstances. And it matters that innocent civilians should not pay for the horrors perpetrated by Hamas.” But his answer didn’t cut it for the Greens senator, who used her supplementary question (senators get three bites of the question time cherry) to hit back. “The Coalition is morally bankrupt when it comes to Palestine and Labor has shown itself to be heartless, gutless, powerless. You are watching the massacre of thousands of Palestinians by Israel and you are not condemning Israel,” the Greens deputy leader yelled. “You are not condemning Israel. You refuse to call for an immediate ceasefire. We are not going to sit here and watch you pat yourselves on the back for doing nothing. “Weasel words are not going to stop war crimes. Today, we bring the people’s protest into parliament.” The senator raised her left fist and shouted: “Free, free Palestine!” Victorian senator Janet Rice lifted a printed A4 page with the Palestinian flag above her head as she, and the other Greens, silently exited the chamber. Senator Farrell said he “completely rejected” the implications put by the Greens and accused them of trying to “make hay” out of the situation. “I don't think any particular political party seeking to make hay out of this terrible situation is going to advance the position in Australia,” he responded. “And whether it‘s the Coalition trying to take political advantage of it, or the Greens.” Speaking afterwards, Senator Faruqi called suggestion she was trying to take political advantage of the conflict was “disgraceful and pretty much despicable”. “If the government can't hear the halls of millions of people in Australia and around the world ... then we will make sure that this week our focus is going to be to pressure the government ... to call apart an immediate ceasefire,” she said. Hamas’s cross-border assault on Israel October 7 killed at least 1400 people and 240 people were taken hostage. Four hostages have since been released. Israel has since closed the borders to Gaza, launched a ground assault and the continued bombardment has killed at least 9700 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday rejected the growing call for a ceasefire in Gaza without the return of the hostages. The Albanese government has repeatedly said it supports Israel’s right to defend itself but has called for a humanitarian pause in Gaza to allow for aid to reach Palestinian civilians. A landmark green energy scheme to keep the lights on as ageing coal fired power generation exits the grid has been unveiled, but the government reveal how much the scheme will cost. Labor has been slammed for being “out of date” on nuclear energy and having an “obsession” with renewables, just days away from a major climate conference in the Middle East. A major change is coming for dual citizens convicted of terrorism with the government vowing to fix “broken” laws.",
Chilling new Hamas tactic revealed,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-conflict-former-footballer-sonny-bill-williams-sparks-fury-with-x-post/news-story/4a460388c352cafc7ff01da30354ca73,"The bloody Israel-Hamas conflict has entered its fifth week and fears are growing of a broader war in the Middle East as tensions in the region rise. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has made a surprise high-security visit to the West Bank, meeting with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Meanwhile, an Israeli model has spoken of hiding under her boyfriend’s body for hours in the wake of a terrorist massacre at a music festival on 7 October. And former footballer turner champion boxer Sonny Bill Williams has been accused of “inciting hatred” with a post about the conflict. Follow on for our latest updates throughout the day. Hamas using cheap drones carrying bombs Hamas is using cheap but highly effective drone warfare in its fightback against Israel’s advance and sophisticated military tactics in Gaza. The Palestinian terrorist group has also revealed it used weaponised amateur drones to help facilitate its surprise attack on Israel on 7 October. Questions have swirled for weeks over how militants were able to take Israeli intelligence services by surprise, with some light now being shed on the use of drones. Non-military quadcopter drones, made in China, dropped explosive devices on surveillance towers near Israeli border towns, it’s been revealed. The country’s so-called ‘electronic fence’ was considered impenetrable before the attacks. Videos shared online by Hamas show cheap drones attacking Israeli troops from above, with one clip showing a grenade being dropped on a group of soldiers. Another clip shows a drone dropping an explosive device on an Israeli MK4 tank. In another video, Lebanese terror group Hezbollah can be seen launching a ‘kamikaze drone’ – a device with bombs strapped to it – at an Israeli army border post. Hamas has said it too has kamikaze drones, which can hover in the air for long periods of time before being crashed into targets. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw a boom in cheap drone warfare, with remodelled commercial devices and inexpensive amateur ones being fitted with weapons. Ukraine has even bought cardboard drones from an Australian manufacturer, making it simple and cost effective to take to the skies. In response, Russia’s struggling army has also deployed weaponised drones. ‘Justifying death’: Royal’s remarks on Israel Queen Rania of Jordan has accused countries that don’t support calls for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict of “endorsing and justifying” civilian deaths. In an explosive interview with CNN, the monarch also attacked Israel’s claims that it’s trying to minimise casualties by encouraging Palestinians to flee. “Over 10,000 people [have been] killed, 70 per cent of whom are women and children,” the Queen said. “For the Israelis to claim that they are trying to protect civilians is … an insult to intelligence.” She also dismissed the argument that a ceasefire would benefit the terrorist group Hamas. The Israeli Defence Forces has vowed to eliminate Hamas, its command centres and vast underground tunnel system, and its leadership via relentless air strikes and ground operations. “I feel that in that argument, they are inherently dismissing the death, in fact, even endorsing and justifying the death of thousands of civilians,” Queen Rania said. The conflict is not addressing the “root causes” of unrest in the region and Israel runs to risk of inspiring other groups to rise up and replace Hamas, she added. “If we do not address these root causes, then you can kill the combatant, but you cannot kill the cause. So, from the rubble of these destroyed buildings will emerge another group more determined and more motivated to do what Hamas did.” The “surest route” to security is through peace, the Queen said. “Not the strongest military or the most capable intelligence services or the Iron Dome or the separation wall will safeguard Israel’s security as much as peace would.” US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was in Jordan at the weekend for talks with King Abdullah. Queen Rania said America’s position is ultimately flawed. “He says that Israel has every right to self-defence, to defend itself within the rules of war in order to ensure that what happened on October 7 never happens again. “If we want to make sure that we never have to be in this situation again, we have to ask ourselves how we got there. There has to be if violence stood between Palestinians and a better future, then they themselves will fight against this violence.” The Queen expressed concern about the skyrocketing civilian death toll in Gaza, with children accounting for almost half of the almost 10,000 deaths. “I think the world is just screaming: How many more people have to die before our global conscience awakes? Or is it forever dormant when it comes to the Palestinians?” Humanitarian agencies and a number of countries have repeatedly pleaded for a pause in hostilities on humanitarian grounds. Today, Pope Francis added to the calls in an address to gathered crowds at St Peter’s Square in the Vatican. “I pray you to stop, in the name of God – cease the fire,” Pope Francis said. “Let us think about the children. Their future is being killed.” Overnight, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected calls for a humanitarian ceasefire and said he won’t entertain the idea until 240 hostages held by Hamas are released. “There will be no ceasefire without the return of our hostages – we say this to both our enemies and our friends,” Mr Netanyahu said in an address to troops at an Air Force base. Meanwhile, it’s been revealed Jordan’s Air Force air-dropped medical aid directly into Gaza, bypassing Israel’s tight embargo on the unsupervised delivery of aid. In a post on X, King Abdullah said the equipment and medications were parachuted to a hospital. “This is our duty to aid our brothers and sisters injured in the war on Gaza. We will always be there for our Palestinian brethren,” King Abdullah wrote. Israel has repeatedly insisted on inspecting all aid bound for Gaza, which can currently only pass through the frequently closed Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Girl ‘murdered’ by Hamas is still alive An eight-year-old girl who Israeli officials said was murdered by Hamas militants in an attack on a village is actually alive, held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. For the past month, Emily Hand’s grief-stricken family have been mourning her death, having been told she was among those killed at Kibbutz Be’eri. The girl was at a sleepover at a friend’s house on the evening of 6 October. The next day, terrorists stormed the community in a siege that killed at least 130 people. A number were slaughtered and set on fire, with bodies left unrecognisable. “We were told that she had been murdered and we were in mourning,” Emily’s older sister Natalie told Israeli news outlet Channel 12. But the Israeli Government last week revealed the child was not murdered and is instead likely being held captive somewhere in Gaza. “I want to tell you that we are doing everything to get you home,” Natalie said. “We know you are being held hostage. We love you so much and miss you.” She said Emily’s young friend and her mother, whose house she was staying in during the attack, are also thought to be alive. Last month in a harrowing interview with CNN, Emily’s father Thomas Hand – an Irish national – said he was relieved to be told she was dead. “She was either dead, or in Gaza. And if you know anything about what they do to people in Gaza, that is worse than death. “They’d have no food. They’d have no water. She’d be in a dark room filled with Christ knows how many people. And terrified every minute, hour, day, and possible years to come. “So, death was a blessing. An absolute blessing.” In an interview with the Irish Times, Mr Hand described Emily as “a little angel”. American nuclear sub arrives A nuclear-powered US submarine has arrived in the Middle East, days after an aircraft carrier. Washington hopes the noticeable presence will act as a deterrent to nations in the region – especially Iran – to stay out of the Israel-Hamas conflict. US Central Command confirmed the arrival of the Ohio class submarine. It joins the USS Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier, guided missile cruiser and a guided missile destroyer, which have been deployed to the region “as part of the increase in regional posture”. Israel encircles Gaza City A major military operation is underway in Gaza, with a series of huge explosions rocking the region as communications are severed once again. The Israeli Defence Forces launched multiple air strikes on various targets and is reportedly preparing for ground troops to enter Gaza City within in the next 48 hours. Vision emerging on social media shows relentless explosions, including in the area surrounding Shifa Hospital. Journalists in the border city of Sderot say “intense” strikes are visible. Al Jazeera reporter Tareq Abu Azzoum wrote that “a residential building was flattered in the north [of Gaza]” as part of the operation. Palestinian social media influencer Muhammad Smiry described it as “the deadliest night” of the conflict so far, writing on X: “This is not hell – this is Gaza.” Journalists inside Gaza report tanks are rolling through the city as IDF warplanes drop bombs from overhead. “This is the most severe bombardment,” journalist Wael Dahdouh said. “There is no safe place.” IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the “extensive” operation is targeting Hamas infrastructure, including underground tunnels where senior militants are believed to be hiding. It has now essentially cut Gaza in half. He said Israeli forces “have encircled Gaza City [and] now there exists a south Gaza and a north Gaza.” Telecommunications and internet connections are down again, with humanitarian groups saying they can’t contact workers on the ground. It marks the third time Israel has severed services to Gaza since 7 October. ScoMo’s bizarre Israel jaunt Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison has unexpectedly popped up in Israel alongside ex-British leader Boris Johnson. Thetrip to the regionamid the ongoing conflict in Gaza was described as a “demonstration of solidarity”. “’It is an opportunity to understand first hand what is occurring on the ground, honour those who have been lost, show support to those who have suffered and are now engaged in this terrible conflict and discuss how to move forward,” Mr Morrison said. The Liberal backbencher was in London last week to speak at a conservative politics conference alongside a string of current and former Opposition colleagues. It’s unclear if his visit to Israel is sanctioned by Liberal leader Peter Dutton. “I’m here because I believe I should be here,” he toldThe Australian. Mr Morrison is the first Australian politician to visit Israel since the 7 October massacres that sparked the Israel-Hamas conflict. “I am thankful for the opportunity to join former Prime Minister Johnson to come to Israel as a demonstration of solidarity with the people and State of Israel and the Jewish community throughout the world,” he said. Mr Johnson and Mr Morrison toured the kibbutz Kfar Aza, where militants killed 57 Israelis and kidnapped 17 people. “You can’t help but be overwhelmed by the sense of that where we’re standing was once, a month ago, a place of innocence and now has been desecrated beyond comprehension,” Mr Morrison said. Speaking to the media while sporting a bulletproof vest, Mr Morrison said he backs Israel’s refusal of a humanitarian ceasefire. In an opinion piece published inThe Australiantoday, timed to coincide with the visit, he revealed Mr Johnson had invited him on the trip. “In undertaking this visit I hoped to demonstrate solidarity with Israel, its people and our own Australian Jewish community,” he wrote. “I never imagined we would ever see the wave of anti-Semitic hatred that has occurred in Australia since the October 7 attacks and the rollout of Israel’s response. “Hatred and intimidation ­directed toward our Jewish community has resulted in Australian Jewish children being afraid to wear their own school uniforms, as it would identify them as a Jew.” Mr Morrison also pre-empted inevitable raised eyebrows about his unusual and unofficial diplomatic visit. “I know I no longer speak for Australia and nor do I pretend to. However, for all those Australians who wish to declare their support for Israel and the Jewish people, I am happy, through the opportunity of this visit, to carry and convey that message on your behalf.” Israel bombs two refugee camps The Israeli Defence Forces has launched air strikes on two refugee camps in Gaza, killing at least 53 people and injuring scores more. Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry officials said recuse workers are searching for survivors in the rubble at the Maghazi camp and the Bureij settlement after “direct” bombing. “All night I and the other men were trying to pick the dead from the rubble,” Saeed al-Nejma told media. “We got children, dismembered, torn-apart flesh.” Authorities say most of the bodies recovered so far belong to women and children. Hospital workers say the air strike on Bureij, inhabited by an estimated 46,000 people, hit a house near a school. The IDF said it’s investigating the claims. Anthony Blinken’s surprise West Bank visit US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made a high-security surprise visit to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, meeting with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. The top US diplomat met with Abbas in Ramallah as global concern grows over rising violence in the occupied territory in tandem with the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Mr Blinken has visited Israel since the start of the war, but this was his first trip to the West Bank. He met with Israeli officials on Friday and said he heard “a clear commitment from the government to deal with extremist violence in the West Bank, to condemn it, to take action to prevent it, to take action against those who perpetrate it”. “This is important, and we will be looking closely to ensure that our friends make good on that commitment,” he said. Sonny Bill Williams sparks fury Former footballer Sonny Bill Williams has been accused of “inciting hatred” against Jewish popular after sharing a fiery social media post about the Israel-Hamas conflict. The champion boxer, who converted to Islam 15 years ago, took to X at the weekend where he slammed the bombing of a major hospital in Gaza, describing Israelis as “Zionist cowards”. “Wallahi [I swear to God] where is our Ummah [Muslim community]?” Williams wrote, alongside a clip of the aftermath of an air strike on a hospital. “Where are the so called men entrusted to stand up and fight for our voiceless – if this footage is too gruesome for you REMEMBER these are the same people that certain parts of the media DEHUMANISE so you think this genocide is warranted. “All you Zionist cowards wouldn’t last a day fighting real men face-to-face. Allahu Akbar [God is great]!!” Last month, the 38-year-old sparked outrage after sharing an X post describing Hamas terrorists as “freedom fighters”. Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said Williams’ latest remarks are “reckless, dangerous and clearly uninformed”. “But to his many fans and followers, they will sound compelling and will serve to incitement hatred and further destabilise our fragile social cohesion,” Mr Ryvchin toldThe Daily Telegraph. “I’m sure Sonny Bill doesn’t want to do this and I would be willing to meet with him to discuss our perspectives and build bridges rather than making enemies.” Model ‘hid under boyfriend’s body’ at festival A 27-year-old Israeli model who survived the Hamas festival massacre has recounted how she was forced to hide under her dead boyfriend‘s body in the back of a bin. Noam Mazal Ben-David said she played dead for two hours surrounded by a pile of corpses, after her partner David Neman and dozens of others were gunned down by Hamas terrorists. She was losing blood rapidly after being shot in the foot and hip but remained silent to stay alive. “They surrounded us and they just kept shooting, non-stop,” she said. “I heard one girl scream ‘Please don’t take me. Just leave me alone’. But they still kidnapped her. They did terrible, terrible things to her. “As the Hamas gunmen approached, David took me and threw me to the back of the container telling me to get as deep as I could and to hide. One of them jumped inside and yelled ‘Allahu Akbar’ and a bomb went off, and they started shooting non-stop. “It was Russian roulette as to who would get a bullet.” The massacre occurred during the Supernova Festival in southern Israel, which was initially billed as a celebration of “friends, love, and infinite freedom”. Netanyahu in hot water again Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in hot water again with remarks suggesting protests by soldiers against his government contributed to the Hamas attacks of 7 October. It comes a week after Mr Netanyahu deleted a post on X attacking security chiefs for failing to warn of the massacres carried out by terrorists, which saw political colleagues brand him “psychotic”. This latest domestic upset prompted senior minister Benny Gantz to hit back. “Over 100% enlistment in reserves and extraordinary mobilisation by all Israeli society are the decisive response to our enemies,” Mr Gantz wrote in a post on X. “Evading responsibility and mud-slinging in a time of war harm the country. The prime minister must clearly and unambiguously retract his words.” Quotes in Hebrew media outlets attributed to the PM called for the Israeli Defence Forces to investigate “insubordination” among reservist soldiers that in part inspired Hamas to attack. “In contrast to reports, the prime minister never said in any manner that insubordination is what led Hamas to attack Israel,” a statement from his office read. “The prime minister said before the war that our enemy must not mistake us, because at the moment of truth everyone will enlist, as indeed happened.” Islamic preacher labels Australians ‘hypocrites’ An Islamic preacher in Sydney has urged Muslims to wage “jihad”, calling Australians “hypocrites” for “forgetting its dark past”. Speaking at Al Madina Dawah Centre in Southwest Sydney, the man known as ‘Brother Ismail’ took aim at Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, the Federal Government and intelligence services, and Islamic leaders who had criticised Jihad fighters overseas. He declared the Hamas members who attacked Israelis on 7 October were not terrorists and instead “freedom fighters” and “warriors”. “There is no other way to defend Muslims … they are so thrilled and looking forward to joining the Mujaheddin,” he said, first reported by The Australian. “That hypocrite Albanese when he came and stepped and dirtied one of the mosques saying and claiming and putting the mouth of hypocrisy and lies to the Muslims, that we love Muslims and respect them. Not long after Allah exposed his lies when he (Albanese) said Israel has the right to defend itself, when he labelled Hamas as terrorists. “We say to every individual who said Hamas were terrorists, did you (Australia) really forget your dark history. “Did you really forget what your ancestors did to the native people in this country, how they killed them, how they chained them like dogs … did you forget that you celebrate every year a massacre you did to the native people. You want to come and teach us about morals?” He went on to claim “Jihad is the solution” and ridiculed ASIO for “wanting to deport me”. “If the Australian government or ASIO like it or not, if they want to deport me or not, the Jihad is the solution for the Ummah (the Islamic community) … There is no other way but fighting in the sake of Allah.” Dozens of UN sites bombed The United Nations says 48 of its installations across Gaza have been damaged in Israeli air strikes since the conflict with Hamas began a month ago. UNRWA, the agency for Palestinian refugees, said nearly 1.5 million people have been displaced across the region since 7 October. And almost half of those people are sheltering in installations controlled by the UN, it added. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
ScoMo’s big call on Israel-Hamas conflict,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/scott-morrison-dismisses-call-for-ceasefire-on-support-tour-to-israel/news-story/50c1cf956430562bd93918ab73392a0c,"Scott Morrison has dismissed the call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict as he toured a Kibbutz decimated by the October 7 attack. The former prime minister said a ceasefire would only “advantage Hamas to be able to strengthen their positions and make this war go on for even longer”. “You can’t help but be overwhelmed by the sense of what we’re standing was once, a month ago, a place of innocence and now has been desecrated beyond comprehension,” Mr Morrison said on the tour of Kfar Aza. The Liberal backbencher is visiting the Jewish state with former British prime minister Boris Johnson on a solidarity tour. The pair also met with former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon on Sunday. Mr Morrison is the first Australian political figure to visit Israel since the conflict began. Hamas’s cross-border assault on Israel on October 7 killed at least 1400 people and 240 people were taken hostage. Four hostages have since been released. Israel has since closed the borders to Gaza, launched a ground assault and the continued bombardment has killed at least 9700 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday rejected the growing call for a ceasefire in Gaza without the return of the hostages. World leaders, including US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, have made the trip to Israel to hold talks with Mr Netanyahu. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has previously said he had no plans to visit the region despite pressure from the Coalition to do so while overseas on visits to the US and China. The Albanese government has repeatedly said it supported Israel’s right to defend itself but has called for a humanitarian pause in Gaza to allow for aid to reach Palestinian civilians. “Suffering in Gaza is widespread,” Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a statement posted to X on Monday. “Food, water, medicine, fuel (and) other essential assistance must reach people in desperate need (and) civilians, including Australians, must be able to get to safety. “This is why we (and) so many countries are calling for humanitarian pauses to hostilities.” On Sunday evening, a group of 12 Australians arrived in Sydney via a Qatar Airways flight after being able to escape Gaza when the Rafah crossing was opened to allow foreign nationals to exit. So far, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has helped about 25 people leave Gaza. A further 79 people, including Australian citizens, permanent residents and family members, remain in Gaza and have requested DFAT’s assistance. “We continue to press for the remaining Australians and their family members in Gaza to be allowed to cross the border to safety and as soon as possible,” a spokesperson said. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

ScoMo makes surprise trip to Israel,https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/scott-morrison-makes-surprise-trip-to-israel-to-show-support/news-story/58519e72e476999d8bfe8f4e2f9859f9,"Scott Morrison has become the first Australian politician to visit Israel in the wake of the Jewish state’s conflict with Hamas. The former prime minister landed at Ben Gurion airport alongside former British prime minister Boris Johnson on Sunday afternoon. “I am thankful for the opportunity to join former Prime Minister Johnson to come to Israel as a demonstration of solidarity with the people and State of Israel and the Jewish community throughout the world,” Mr Morrison said on Sunday. “It is an opportunity to understand first hand what is occurring on the ground, honour those who have been lost, show support to those who have suffered and are now engaged in this terrible conflict and discuss how to move forward.” Hamas’s cross-border assault on Israel October 7 killed at least 1400 people and 240 people were taken hostage. Four hostages have been since been released. Israel has since closed the borders to the territory, launched a ground assault and the continued bombardment has killed at least 9500 people. Mr Morrison, whose government recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2018, last week signed a joint-letter last week unequivocally condemning the actions of Hamas and the creepings of anti-semitism in Australia. The six former leaders said there was no place for racial or religious hatred in Australia and warned against allowing the Israel-Hamas war to “turn Australians against each other”. “It was the single greatest massacre of Jewish since the Holocaust and its grotesque cruelty and violence was comparable to that of ISIS,” the statement said, referring to the ISIL armed group. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese previously said he had no plans to visit Israel following the conflict. He has repeatedly reiterated his support for Israel’s right to defend itself but sharpened his rhetoric last week, insisting Israel must observe the rules of law. “The civilian toll is quite rightly causing enormous concern around the world,” he said at a conference in Melbourne on Thursday. “Every effort has to be made to ensure that innocent civilians are protected to every extent possible. “It is very difficult because of the way that Hamas operates with the use of civilian infrastructure being mixed with what is effectively military infrastructure … but every single effort has to be made.” The Greens leader has issued a warning to the major political parties as he joins a blockade at a major port to demonstrate for environmental change. Holland’s hard-right new leader Geert Wilder’s victory has exposed an issue that Australia needs to learn from. A minister’s office has been vandalised for the second time in as many weeks amid growing tensions within the community over the Israel-Hamas conflict.",
Model ‘hid under boyfriend’s body’ at festival,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-lebanons-hezbollah-joins-crossborder-clashes/news-story/e673cf32ca3394dd0bb3cfe45c75af31,"Welcome back to our live coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas. Israel has battled into the fifth week of its war against Hamas and marked the milestone by sharing disturbing footage of the bloody aftermath at the Tribe of Nova music festival massacre. “Four weeks ago today, 200+ young Israelis were butchered by Hamas terrorists at the Nova music festival,” thecountry’s official X account wroteSaturday. The Israeli army said its troops had launched an operation in southern Gaza overnight, after deadly strikes hit an ambulance convoy and a school-turned-refugee shelter in the besieged Palestinian enclave. The IDF said it had come under attack several times from Hamas “tunnel shafts and military compounds” in northern Gaza and had killed many “terrorists” and destroyed three observation posts. Hamas said it had hit an Israeli convoy with mortar fire. Meanwhile, there are concerns Hassan Nasrallah, who runs Lebanon’s Hezbollah, could escalate the conflict with Israel leading to a war on two fronts. Nasrallah said “all options are open” depending on Israel’s actions in Gaza. The US immediately warned Hezbollah, an Iranian backed anti-Israel militant group, not to “take advantage” of the conflict. But one particular comment Nasrallah made raised eyebrows. He sought to distance both Hezbollah and its backer Iran from Hamas’ October 7 massacre saying it was a “100 per cent Palestinian” organised attack which had been “kept secret” from all others. Since October 7, Israel has been engaged in a fierce war with Hamas, after the Palestinian militant group that rules the region carried out a deadly attack in southern Israel that killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel has retaliated with relentless strikes and a ground invasion of Gaza, where more than 9,400 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. Read on for the latest updates. US Secretary of State travels to West Bank US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made a high-security surprise visit to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, meeting with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas. The top US diplomat met with Abbas in Ramallah as global concern grows over rising violence in the occupied territory in tandem with the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza since October 7. Blinken has visited Israel since the start of the war, but this was his first trip to the West Bank. Blinken, who met with Israeli officials on Friday, said he heard “a clear commitment from the government to deal with extremist violence in the West Bank, to condemn it, to take action to prevent it, to take action against those who perpetrate it.” “This is important, and we will be looking closely to ensure that our friends make good on that commitment,” he said. Model ‘hid under boyfriend’s body’ at festival A 27-year-old Israeli model who survived the Hamas festival massacre has recounted how she was forced to hide under her boyfriend‘s dead body in the back of a skip as terrorists crossed the Israel border and massacred innocent civilians. Noam Mazal Ben-David said she played dead for two hours surrounded by a pile of corpses, after her partner David Neman and dozens of others were gunned down by Hamas terrorists. She was losing blood rapidly after being shot in the foot and hip but remained silent to stay alive. The massacre occurred during the Supernova Festival in southern Israel, which was initially billed as a celebration of “friends, love, and infinite freedom”. “They surrounded us and they just kept shooting, non-stop,” she said. “I heard one girl scream ‘Please don’t take me. Just leave me alone’. But they still kidnapped her. They did terrible, terrible things to her. “As the Hamas gunmen approached, David took me and threw me to the back of the container telling me to get as deep as I could and to hide. One of them jumped inside and yelled ‘Allahu Akbar’ and a bomb went off, and they started shooting non-stop. “It was Russian roulette as to who would get a bullet.” More than 30 killed at refugee camp: Palestine The Hamas-run health ministry said more than 30 people were killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza late Saturday. An Israeli military spokesperson said they were looking into whether its troops had been operating in the area at the time. Earlier on Saturday, the health ministry said at least 15 people were killed when Israel struck the Al-Fakhura school in Jabalia refugee camp, operated by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA. Thousands of displaced Palestinians were sheltering at the school in the north of the Palestinian territory when it was hit, a ministry spokesperson said. Islamic preacher labels Australians ‘hypocrites’ An Islamic preacher in Sydney has urged Muslims to wage “jihad”, calling Australians “hypocrites” for “forgetting its dark past”. Speaking at Al Madina Dawah Centre in Southwest Sydney, ‘Brother Ismail’ took aim at Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, the federal government and intelligence service, and Islamic leaders who had criticised Jihad fighters overseas. He declared the Hamas members who attacked Israelis on October 7 were not terrorists and instead “freedom fighters” and “warriors”. “There is no other way to defend Muslims... they are so thrilled and looking forward to joining the Mujahedin,” he said, first reported byThe Australian. “That hypocrite Albanese when he came and stepped and dirtied one of the mosques saying and claiming and putting the mouth of hypocrisy and lies to the Muslims, that we love Muslims and respect them. Not long after Allah exposed his lies when he (Albanese) said Israel has the right to defend itself, when he labelled Hamas as terrorists. “We say to every individual who said Hamas were terrorists, did you (Australia) really forget your dark history,” he said. “Did you really forget what your ancestors did to the native people in this country, how they killed them, how they chained them like dogs... did you forget that you celebrate every year a massacre you did to the native people. You want to come and teach us about morals?” He went on to claim “Jihad is the solution” and ridiculed ASIO for “wanting to deport me”. “Go look at your past and open your eyes,” he said. “This is called Jihad that you have no idea about.” “If the Australian government or ASIO like it or not, if they want to deport me or not, the Jihad is the solution for the Ummah (the Islamic community)…,” he also said. “There is no other way but fighting in the sake of Allah.” ‘F*** Joe Biden’: Protesters smear White House fence in red paint Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters massed in Washington, DC, in the US, before descending upon the White House to chant, “Allahu Akbar” and “F*** Joe Biden”, at a rally on Saturday afternoon. “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” the crowd dotted with Palestinian flags and signs cried at the start of the event, which drew attendees from across the country. The chant – which is growing increasingly popular in the wake of Hamas’ deadly incursion into southern Israel last month and Israel’s subsequent retaliatory attacks on Gaza – is widely considered anti-Semitic because it implies the elimination of the State of Israel and its people. Others chanted, “Long live the Intifada,” an Arabic word used to refer to Palestinian uprising, specifically to conflicts that ran from 1987 and 1993 and from 2000 to about 2005 that left thousands dead. Unofficial reports estimate 300,000 showed up to the protest, but DC Police could not confirm. As the protesters began marching down the roadways of DC, many stopped outside the White House to yell for Biden to call for a ceasefire. It is unclear if Biden was there. Around 7:30pm, protesters were smearing red paint on the gates of the White House and chanting: “Allahu Akbar,” “F*** Joe Biden”. While the protest took shape in the nation’s capital, more than 1,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators blocked traffic in Manhattan’s Herald Square, demanding a ceasefire, before the throng moved east to the United Nations, where the crowd swelled to 2,000, police sources toldThe New York Post. There were no incidents or arrests before the crowd dispersed around 7:30pm, the sources said. Protests broke out elsewhere around the world over the weekend, including in London where thousands swarmed for a pro-Palestinian rally at Trafalgar Square. Police said four officers were injured at the rally after protesters launched fireworks towards police, with 29 people arrested for a number of offences including racial hatred, other racially motivated crimes, violence and assaulting a police officer. – With the New York Post UN outrage at Israel ambulance bombing Reports say 15 people were killed and 50 others wounded after the strike hit the convoy near the territory’s largest hospital Al-Shifa on Friday, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent and the Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Guterres condemned the strike in a statement, saying: “I am horrified by the reported attack in Gaza on an ambulance convoy outside Al Shifa hospital. The images of bodies strewn on the street outside the hospital are harrowing.” He added that an entire population has been “traumatised” and “nowhere is safe” in the city as the conflict rages on. “Now, for nearly one month, civilians in Gaza, including children and women, have been besieged, denied aid, killed, and bombed out of their homes. This must stop.” Israel’s military confirmed it had targeted an ambulance used by a “Hamas terrorist cell” and had “neutralised” those inside. An AFP journalist saw multiple bodies beside the blood-splattered Palestinian Red Crescent vehicle. Doctors Without Borders labelled the attack on the ambulance “horrendous”, saying the conflict had reached “a new low”. “This is a lethal attack outside Gaza’s main and busiest hospital, where our staff work daily to provide lifesaving medical care,” it said in a statement Saturday. “This is a new low in an endless stream of unconscionable violence. The repeated strikes on hospitals, ambulances, densely populated areas and refugee camps are disgraceful. How many people have to die before world leaders wake up and call for a ceasefire?” – With AFP‘Eliminate’: Israel’s warning for Hamas leaderIsrael’s defence minister has issued a warning for the head of Hamas as the war continues into its fifth week. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Saturday vowed Israeli forces would “find and eliminate” Yahya Sinwar, the head of Palestinian militant group in Gaza. “We will find Sinwar and will eliminate him,” he said. “I tell the residents of Gaza – if you reach him before us, it will shorten the war.” Israel’s military earlier called Sinwar a “dead man walking” after the war broke out last month. “He chose to send the butchers into our bedrooms to kill our babies,” a spokesman for the Israeli military toldNBC News. “And when they chose to go full front against Israel, they signed their own death warrant.” Israel releases disturbing video of music festival massacre Israel shared a disturbing video of the bloody aftermath of Hamas’ massacre at the Tribe of Nova music festival to mark four weeks since the terror attack. “Four weeks ago today, 200+ young Israelis were butchered by Hamas terrorists at the Nova music festival,” thecountry’s official X account wroteSaturday. “This is what the aftermath looked like through the eyes of an IDF soldier who came to rescue survivors. ‘Don’t look away.” The footage shows an IDF soldier helping secure the desolate festival ground while walking among the bloodied bodies of dead revellers. At one point, the soldier peers over a large bar, only to find several more victims sprawled between the coolers. ‘Targeted raid’ The Israeli military describes Gaza City as “the centre of the Hamas terror organisation” and says it is targeting militants, weapons stores, tunnel complexes and command centres. Overnight, Israeli ground forces launched “a targeted raid” to map tunnels and clear explosive traps in southern Gaza, where it has struck before but rarely sent in troops, the military said. “The troops encountered a terrorist cell exiting a tunnel shaft. In response, the troops fired shells toward the terrorists and killed them,” it said. Israel says it has struck 12,000 targets across the Palestinian territory since October 7, one of the fiercest bombing campaigns in recent memory. The army on Saturday sent text messages to Gazans saying the territory’s main north-south road would be open for three hours in the afternoon so people can evacuate. A key focus of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to Israel on Friday was to convince Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to enact “humanitarian pauses”. Netanyahu said later, however, that he would not agree to a “temporary truce” with Hamas until the Islamist group releases more than 240 Israeli and foreign hostages it abducted during its October 7 attack. Lebanon’s Hezbollah joins cross-border clashes The Israeli military and powerful Lebanese movement Hezbollah engaged in cross-border clashes on Saturday, with both claiming to have hit each other’s positions along the frontier. The latest skirmishes came a day after Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah warned that the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip could turn into a regional conflict if Israel pushed on with its offensive in the Palestinian territory. On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had struck “two terrorist cells” and a Hezbollah post after an attempted attack from Lebanon. “In response to two terrorist cells attempting to fire from Lebanon toward Israeli territory, the IDF (military) struck the cells and a Hezbollah observation post,” a military statement said. It said it had also responded to mortar fire from Lebanon into northern Israel, where no casualties were reported. Hezbollah said it had simultaneously attacked five Israeli positions along the border. Hours later it announced a new attack on the Al-Abbad Israeli position without specifying what kind of weapon was used. Israel’s military said in a new statement that its fighter jets struck “terror targets” of Hezbollah, accompanied by tank and artillery fire. “The Hezbollah targets struck include terror infrastructure, rocket storage sites and military compounds,” it said. Hezbollah chief blames US In his first speech since the Israel-Hamas war broke out four weeks ago, Nasrallah warned Friday that “all options” were open for an expansion of the conflict to Lebanon as he blamed the United States for the war in Gaza. “America is entirely responsible for the ongoing war on Gaza and its people, and Israel is simply a tool of execution,” Nasrallah said in a televised broadcast, calling the conflict “decisive”. “Whoever wants to prevent a regional war – and this is addressed to the Americans – must quickly stop the aggression on Gaza,” he said. Israel fires missile at Hamas leader’s house An Israeli drone fired a missile at the Gaza house of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh who is currently outside the enclave, Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa Radio reported on Saturday. It was unclear whether any of his family members were at the house when it was struck. Haniyeh, Hamas’ political chief, has been outside the Gaza Strip since 2019, residing between Turkey and Qatar. — Reuters Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Hope for Aussies trapped in Gaza,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/anxious-wait-for-67-australians-who-remain-trapped-in-gaza/news-story/85ae27af87845ef43d347bf91a2e7cb2,"Australians stuck in Gaza are anxiously waiting for their chance to cross into Egypt amid hopes there could be further evacuations over the coming days. Last week, 25 Australian citizens and their family members escaped the besieged territory after being allowed through the Rafah crossing. Tonight a further 12 Australians will touch down in Sydney, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed on Sunday, on Qatar Airways flight QR908, the largest group to arrive on a single commercial flight into the country. On Saturday, family of four arrived into Adelaide and a family of three arrived in Melbourne “We continue to engage closely with partners in the region to ensure the remaining Australians in Gaza who wish to leave are able to do so as soon as possible,” a DFAT spokesman said. “Departures depend on a range of factors, and the situation in Gaza remains highly challenging and can change rapidly.” But since there has been no further movements, Assistant Foreign Affairs Minister Tim Watts said on Sunday the government was “pressing very hard” to repatriate Australians from the “dire” situation in Gaza. “It really is a very serious humanitarian situation there,” he said. “That’s also why we’ve been calling for a humanitarian pause to enable that desperately needed humanitarian support to get to the people that need it, safely.” The pass into Egypt was opened as part of a multinational deal brokered between US, Egypt, Israel and Qatar to allow foreign citizens to leave Gaza. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed as of Sunday there were still 67 Australians and family members trapped in Gaza. “We continue to engage closely with partners in the region to ensure the remaining Australians in Gaza who wish to leave are able to do so as soon as possible,” a spokesperson said. Mr Watts also acknowledged the increasingly severe humanitarian situation in Gaza and flagged the government’s $25m aid package to provide food, water, medical assistance and fuel. Only 300 trucks with food, water and medicine have been allowed entry into Gaza by Israel in the past 13 days for a population of more than 2.2 million, according to the United Nations. Mr Watts echoed calls from Foreign Minister Penny Wong for a humanitarian ‘pause’ and added that his government was not in a political position to call for a ceasefire. “A ceasefire is traditionally viewed as part of a political process where the parties come together to seek to negotiate as part of a broader political conclusion to a conflict,” he said. “We recognise that the parties aren’t in a position where they can negotiate a political settlement on this issue at present, but there is a desperate humanitarian need now. “We need to get that food, water, medical supplies and fuel into Gaza as soon as possible to help those people who are absolutely desperately in need.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Israeli mum watches murder of daughter,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallahs-dark-warning-to-the-west/news-story/87a8c1a0a1a4ed64e7869b2158a3f9dc,"Welcome back to our live coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas. An Israeli mother whose daughter was brutally killed by Hamas in front of her and whose husband was abducted has shared a horrifying account of what happened. The deadly rampage was filmed by the terrorists and callously uploaded on the woman’s Facebook account. Gali Idan has now spoken about the ordeal to raise awareness about her husband’s plight. There has been more carnage in Gaza with a new video emerging purportedly showing at least a dozen Gaza residents shot dead in the streets by Hamas terrorists as they were attempting to flee from the north to the south of the Hamas-controlled region. The footage comes as the leader of militant group Hezbollah made a much anticipated speech early on Saturday morning (AEST) – his first since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas. There were concerns Hassan Nasrallah, who runs the Iranian backed anti-Israel militant group, could escalate the conflict with Israel leading to a war on two fronts. He didn’t go that far. At least not yet. Nasrallah said “all options are open” depending on Israel’s actions in Gaza. The US immediately warned Hezbollah not to “take advantage” of the conflict. But one particular comment Nasrallah made raised eyebrows. He sought to distance both Hezbollah and its backer Iran from Hamas’ October 7 massacre that killed 1400 Israelis saying it was a “100 per cent Palestinian” organised attack which had been “kept secret” from all others. Meanwhile, Israel has admitted it carried out a deadly attack on a convoy of ambulances leaving Gaza City saying Hamas was using the vehicles to transport terrorists. Around 15 people are thought to have died. But a Hamas spokesman denied the allegations and said the group holds “United States of America and the international community responsible” for the strike. This blog is now closed. Israel fires missile at Hamas leader’s house An Israeli drone fired a missile at the Gaza house of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh who is currently outside the enclave, Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa Radio reported on Saturday. It was unclear whether any of his family members were at the house when it was struck. Haniyeh, Hamas’ political chief, has been outside the Gaza Strip since 2019, residing between Turkey and Qatar. — Reuters Israel strikes temporary home shelter At the Osama bin Zaid Boys School north of Gaza City, AFP saw the aftermath of what Hamas authorities said was Israeli tank shelling that killed 20 people. Ambulance teams rushed into the debris-littered building to aid the injured and remove the dead. Stunned onlookers wept and wandered the scene with hands clasped above the head in horror and disbelief. A long row of washing still hung from windows on the building’s first storey, evidence that the school had become a temporary home for some of the hundreds of thousands displaced by the war. Israel’s military describes Gaza City as “the centre of the Hamas terror organisation” and says it is targeting Hamas operatives, weapons stores, tunnel complexes, drone launching posts and command centres there. — AFP Israeli military’s new ‘terrorist’ claim Israel’s military has claimed it “eliminated terrorists” and found weapons belonging to Hamas while exploring tunnel shafts in northern Gaza throughout the past day. Israeli soldiers fought 15 militants, killed several of them and destroyed three Hamas observation posts, Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari wrote to X. The troops reportedly took to “an area from which many attempts to attack the IDF forces through tunnel shafts and military compounds were detected,” the post read. Truce ruled out A “temporary truce” has been ruled out despite efforts from US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who arrived in Amman last Friday to meet Jordan’s King Abdullah II. Mr Blinken left Israel empty handed as he attempted to secure “humanitarian pauses” in the war against Hamas. The US leader encouraged Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to temporarily pause Israel’s military offensive so aid could be provided, but the request was denied. Mr Netanyahu, following the meeting, said there would be no “temporary truce” in Gaza until Hamas released Israeli hostages. Mr Blinken will also be joining foreign ministers from five Arab countries, expected to be attended by a representative of the Palestinian Authority, a rival of Hamas. Israeli mother’s distressing account of attack An Israeli mother whose daughter was killed in the deadly October 7 attack and whose husband was taken hostage has given a distressing account of what happened. Gali Idan toldCNNthe family’s distress was compounded by the terrorists using her phone to livestream the ordeal to her family and friends on Facebook. She said she struggled to keep her three children quiet as they were “crying and fearful” during the attack. With no lock on the safe room her husband Tsachi, tried valiantly to wedge furniture in front of the door to protect the family once they heard Hamas had breached the kibbutz. She said she heard the Hamas terrorists walking on glass in the house before eventually shooting her 17-year-old daughter Maayan through the door. “It’s my daughter, my daughter, she is 18 in four days,” she said crying. Her husband tried to save Maayan “sitting in her blood to help her”. “I told the kids not look because I didn’t want them to see their sister in a pile of blood,” she said. Her husband was so distraught he could not speak, adding to the confusion. Eventually Tsachi was told to get up, she said, as the children screamed at the terrorists not to take their father. ‘Significant’ pause needed in conflict: US Talks are being held on a “very significant” pause in the Middle East conflict to win the release of dozens of hostages taken by Palestinian militant group Hamas, a senior White House official said on Friday. “It is something that is under a very serious and active discussion. But there is no agreement as of yet to actually get this done,” the official said, as fighting between US ally Israel and Hamas raged in the Gaza Strip. An estimated 240 Israeli and foreign hostages were kidnapped by Hamas during its October 7 assault on Israel. The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said “nobody knows” the exact number of hostages, adding that it was “well over 100 and maybe over 200.” To get that many people out “is going to require a fairly significant pause in hostilities.” But the official warned: “There’s absolutely no guarantee a) that is going to happen or b) when it’s going to happen.” -AFP Blinken in Jordan as war rages US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has met Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Saturday after leaving Israel empty-handed in his efforts to secure humanitarian “pauses” in its war to destroy Hamas. Blinken arrived late Friday in Amman where he will also join a meeting of foreign ministers of five Arab countries which will be attended by a representative of the Palestinian Authority (PA) led by president Mahmud Abbas, a rival of Hamas. In Israel, he discussed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the idea of “humanitarian pauses” to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and to allow aid to be distributed to the beleaguered population of the Gaza Strip. But after meeting Blinken on Friday, Netanyahu warned there could be no “temporary truce” in Gaza unless Hamas releases the hostages it holds. . Jordan said in a statement Friday the foreign ministers of Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar as well as a PA representative will meet Blinken in Amman to discuss the war. Biden’s stance could ‘cost votes’ President Biden’s strong support for Israel is inflaming anger among Democratic activists and there are signs that it could be the final straw for many younger voters who helped put him in the White House. Several polls suggest that Biden, 80, is out of step with a generation increasingly sympathetic with the Palestinian cause and less inclined to give Israel the benefit of the doubt. University campuses and secondary schools had students hold pro-Palestinian protests, with some seeing this as an extension of the racial justice campaign in 2020 after the police murder of George Floyd. While young voters who backed Biden in 2020 are unlikely to defect to the Republicans, they are already showing strong support for independent candidates planning to stand in 2024. This week a poll by Quinnipiac University put the total of those aged 18-34 backing the campaign of Robert F Kennedy Jr, who abandoned a challenge for the Democratic presidential nomination, on 31 per cent, with a further 10 per cent supporting the left-wing academic Cornel West. Biden was on 29 per cent and Trump 27 per cent. “This is a very different youth electorate today than it was four years ago,” said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. -with AFP Hamas deception exposed TheNew York Postreports on quite an extraordinary statement from a senior Joe Biden administration official during a call with reporters, going some way to explain the slow pace of getting foreign nationals out of the Gaza Strip. “Hamas was not allowing anybody to leave,” the person said. “And then they said that they would allow foreign nationals to leave, subject to a number of wounded Palestinians being allowed to leave, as well, which of course is not objectionable. “But the list that was provided, once it was vetted, about a third of the wounded Palestinians on the list were members of Hamas,” the official went on, calling the subterfuge “unacceptable”. War crimes complaint against Hamas The families of nine Israeli victims of the October 7 Hamas massacre have lodged a complaint at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for suspected war crimes, according to theTimes of Israel. Lawyer Francois Zimeray, who is representing the families of the victims, said in a statement on Friday that the families also want Hamas prosecuted for genocide, and for the ICC to issue an international arrest warrant for its leaders.

On October 7, the terror group carried out a bloody onslaught in southern Israel, killing some 1,400 people and taking at least 246 hostages, of whom just four have been released, while one was rescued by the Israel Defense Forces. The vast majority of those killed that day were civilians, many of them slaughtered in their homes. At least 260 were massacred at an outdoor music festival. In his statement, Zimeray confirmed that the complaint being submitted to the ICC concerned only civilians, several of whom were at the music festival near Re’im on the Gaza border. Horrifying video of Gaza attack A horrifying new video purportedly shows at least a dozen Gaza residents shot dead in the streets by Hamas terrorists as they were attempting to flee from the north to the south of the Hamas-controlled region. In thevideo posted on X, a man films the carnage as he rides a bicycle down the Al Rasheed beach road, crying out in anguish as the camera focuses on the dead bodies, many of them lying in pools of blood. In a separate post, author and journalist Amjad Taha said the victims were among “dozens” killed by Hamas snipers, including women and children, because “they do not want citizens to leave”. “They want to use them as human shields and will kill anyone who attempts to leave. Hamas terrorists in Gaza will, as usual, blame #Israel because it is easy and there is media that accepts this propaganda,” he wrote. The video is fuelling disturbing speculation that Hamas has been killing Gaza citizens and attempting to blame their deaths on Israeli air strikes. Taha says the man shooting the video from the bicycle is saying “Airstrikes? Does this look like air strikes?” in Arabic. Israel has faced mounting pressure to broker a temporary ceasefire with Hamas in recent days, including from President Biden and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, following a prolonged military campaign in Gaza that began when terrorists invaded Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1400 people. -New York Post US renews talk of Palestinian state With Israel’s campaign against Hamas raging, the United States has renewed calls to work toward a Palestinian state, but few expect success now after decades of failure. President Joe Biden’s administration, which has faced heated criticism in the Arab world for supporting Israel’s retaliation over an October 7 Hamas attack that largely targeted civilians, has in recent days subtly changed tone by emphasising the need to minimise harm to Palestinian civilians. Speaking Friday on his latest trip to Israel, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for “humanitarian pauses” to let in assistance and said that longer term a two-state solution was “the best viable path – indeed, the only path.” “That’s the only guarantor of a secure, Jewish, and democratic Israel; the only guarantor of Palestinians realising their legitimate right to live in a state of their own, enjoying equal measures of security, freedom, opportunity and dignity; the only way to end a cycle of violence once and for all,” Blinken said in Tel Aviv. But a two-state solution was blessed almost exactly 30 years earlier by the Oslo Accords and has not come to fruition, with the Palestinian Authority enjoying only limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank, and the United States not leading a concerted diplomatic effort to the goal since John Kerry’s efforts a decade ago. – With AFP ‘Some would like us to join a war’: Hezbollah chief In a highly anticipated speech on Friday (local time), Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah threatened more attacks on Israel – and that its actions could escalate – but he did not declare war. “Some would like Hezbollah to engage in an all-out war, but I can tell you: What is happening now along the Israeli-Lebanese border is significant, and it is not the end. “ We have been engaged in a true battle. The amount of our martyrs — 57 — testifies to this”. Continued warnings from Israel that it could attack if Hezbollah escalates; the presence of US military hardware just off the coast and that most in Lebanon do not want a war, may have tempered the group. But, he warned, Hezbollah’s stance could change depending on Israel’s actions in Gaza: “The possibility of the Lebanese front escalating into broad battle is a realistic option”. “All options are open”. The US shot back at the comments. “We and our partners have been clear: Hezbollah and other actors — state or non-state — should not try to take advantage of the ongoing conflict,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. She added the US does not want to see an escalation. Nasrallah warned Israel against a “pre-emptive attack” against Hezbollah. “It will be the most foolish mistake you make in your entire existence”. Nasrallah also called for a ceasefire. “I tell Israel: Do not go any further. Many civilians have already died. I promise you: A civilian for a civilian.” Hezbollah chief’s surprising reveal Unexpectedly, Nasrallah distanced Hezbollah from the October 7 attacks. “This was 100 per cent Palestinian. The international community keeps bringing up Iran and its military plans, but the attack was planned and executed by Palestinians for the Palestinian cause, it has no relation at all to any international or regional issues. “This element of secrecy was the linchpin to the shocking success.” Nonetheless, Nasrallah said the outcomes of the attack were profound and showed how “weak” Israel was. “The glorious operation,” exposed “the frailty, weakness and total fragility of Israel … it’s more fragile than a spider’s web”. Nasrallah added that the US, not Israel or Hamas, was “responsible” for the current conflict. “The United States is completely responsible for the war raging in Gaza … It is the US that must pay the price for the crimes perpetrated in Gaza. “If an all-out war breaks out, you Americans will pay with your ships, your aircraft and your soldiers,” he threatened. Hezbollah leader’s bizarre claim During his speech Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah made the preposterous claim that most of the 1400 victims on October 7 were killed by Israeli soldiers. That’s despite Hamas militants in some cases gloating over their kills and footage of gunmen shooting Israelis. IDF soldiers were “acting insanely as they were caught by surprise” he said, reportedThe Times of Israel. Nasrallah also said that Israel “cannot achieve” its goal of eliminating Hamas. “Among the gravest mistakes committed by the enemy in the past is setting high goals that they cannot achieve. They set as the top goal to annihilate Hamas, the whole of Hamas”. Israel admits to hitting ambulance convoy On Friday (local time) an Israeli strike hit several ambulances. It’s been claimed around 15 people died in the attack near the territory’s largest hospital. A government statement said Israeli forces targeted “a convoy of ambulances which was transporting the wounded” from Gaza City towards Rafah, in the south. Pictures from the seen have shown what appear to be several dead bodies as well as a dead horse. In addition to the fatalities, Hamas has said around 50 people were injured. Israel has claimed responsibility for the missile strike but claimed that Hamas militants were using the ambulances as cover. But a Hamas spokesman denied the allegations and said the group holds “United States of America and the international community responsible” for the strike. “An IDF aircraft struck an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in proximity to their position in the battle zone,” the IDF said in a statement. “A number of Hamas terrorist operatives were killed in the strike. We have information which demonstrates that Hamas’ method of operation is to transfer terror operatives and weapons in ambulances.” It’s the latest strike by Israel this week which has caused uproar. Even if Tel Aviv is correct, and the targets have been Hamas operatives and command centres, civilians have also been casualties. Head of the World Health Organisation Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he was “utterly shocked” by the strike, near Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital. Israel says the hospital is on top of Hamas infrastructure. “We reiterate: patients, health workers, facilities, and ambulances must be protected at all times. Always. Ceasefire NOW,” said Dr Ghebreyesus. Blinken told there will no ‘pause’ US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Friday in a trip focused on measures to minimise harm to civilians in the war in Gaza. The office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted pictures of the meeting between the Israeli PM and Mr Blinken. Mr Blinken is on his third visit to the country since the deadly Hamas attacks on 7 October. Prior to his departure from the US, Mr Blinken said he would seek “concrete steps” from Israel to ensure that harm to Palestinian civilians is reduced, as US President Joe Biden also called for humanitarian pauses in the conflict. “When I see a Palestinian child — a boy, a girl — pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child in Israel or anywhere else,” Mr Blinken said. “So this is something that we have an obligation to respond to, and we will.” But Mr Netanyahu seemed to rebuff Mr Blinken saying that there would no pauses until all the hostages were freed – likely to be a high bar. “Israel is objecting a temporary ceasefire which does not include freeing all our hostages,” he said on Friday. Biden promises ramped up military aid Biden has promised full support and ramped-up military aid to Israel for its campaign in Gaza, but in a visible shift of tone has also voiced empathy for Palestinian suffering which has stoked anger in parts of the world. “I think we need a pause,” Biden said on Thursday at a campaign event. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby later clarified what such a pause would entail. “A humanitarian pause … is temporary, localised and focused, focused on a particular objective or objectives, humanitarian aid in, people out,” Kirby told reporters UN reveals huge figure required to assist Gaza civilians The UN on Friday launched an emergency aid appeal seeking $1.2 billion to help some 2.7 million people in Gaza and the West Bank. “The cost of meeting the needs of 2.7 million people – that is the entire population of Gaza and 500,000 people in the occupied West Bank – is estimated to be $1.2 billion,” the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said. “The original appeal, launched 12 October, asked for $294 million to support nearly 1.3 million people. The situation has grown increasingly desperate since then,” it added. It came after Israel began sending thousands of Palestinian workers back to Gaza who had been stranded inside Israel since its war with Hamas erupted, a Gaza border official said. “Thousands of workers who were blocked in Israel since October 7 have been brought back,” Hisham Adwan, head of Gaza’s crossings authority, told AFP. AFPTV footage shot early on Friday showed groups of workers arriving through the Karem Abu Salem crossing between Israel and southern Gaza, which is normally only used for goods. Israel ‘severs all contact’ with 18,500 workers The Israeli government has announced that thousands of Gazans working in Israel will be sent back to the region under siege, as part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s bold retaliation plan following the October 7 attacks. “Israel is severing all contact with Gaza. There will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza. Those workers from Gaza who were in Israel on the day of the outbreak of the war will be returned to Gaza,” a post from Mr Netanyahu’s office on X, formerly Twitter, said. Israel’s security cabinet has also made moves to “deduct all funds designated for the Gaza Strip … from Palestinian Authority [PA] funds”. Prior to the current conflict, approximately 18,500 Palestinians from Gaza had been given permits to enter Israel. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
‘Doomsday weapon’: Israel’s worst-kept secret,https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/thats-one-way-israeli-cabinet-minister-says-nuking-gaza-is-an-option/news-story/7822218dceeb4c77e2204d30e1da292b,"A far-right minister in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has sparked fury after suggesting Israel could nuke Gaza. “That’s one way,” Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said during an interview on Radio Kol Berama on Sunday. The interviewer had asked, “Your expectation is that tomorrow morning we’d drop what amounts to some kind a nuclear bomb on all of Gaza, flattening them, eliminating everybody there?” When it was pointed out there were still some 240 hostages being held by Hamas, Mr Eliyahu doubled down, saying while he prayed for their return “there is a price to be paid in war”. “Why are the lives of the abductees, whose release I really want, more important than the lives of the soldiers and the people who will be murdered later?” he said. The comments, which made headlines in Arab andIsraeli media, were quickly disavowed by Mr Netanyahu, who immediately suspended Mr Eliyahu from cabinet meetings. “Amichai Eliyahu’s words are detached from reality,” the PM said in a statement. “Israel and the IDF are acting in accordance with the highest standards of international law in order to prevent harm to uninvolved people, and we will continue to do that all the way to victory.” Mr Eliyahu is a member of National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s far-right Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, and does not have any connection to the three-member war cabinet overseeing the operation against Hamas,The Times of Israelreports. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity leader Minister Benny Gantz both condemned Mr Eliyahu for the “horrifying” and “irresponsible” comments, which Mr Eliyahu has since tried towalk back. “It is clear to all sensible people that the statement about the atom is metaphorical,” he wrote on X. “However, a strong and disproportionate response to terrorism is definitely required, which will clarify to the Nazis and their supporters that terrorism is not worthwhile. This is the only formula that democratic states can use to deal with terrorism. At the same time, it is clear that the State of Israel is committed to doing everything possible to return the hostages safe and sound.” Israel’s nukes Fears that the war between Israel and Hamas could spiral into a wider regional conflict have again raised the spectre of nuclear weapons — and Israel’s own “worst kept secret”. Israel iswidely believedto have around 80 to 90 plutonium-based nuclear warheads, and enough material for more than 200, making it one of only nine nuclear-armed countries alongside Russia, the US, China, France, the UK, Pakistan, India and North Korea. The arsenal consists of an estimated 30 gravity bombs for delivery by aircraft, with the remainder of the warheads for delivery by missiles. The Jericho II medium-range ballistic missile and Jericho III intermediate-range ballistic missile “are believed to be based with their mobile launchers in caves at a military base east of Jerusalem”, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute says. According to ProfessorClive Williamsfrom the ANU’s Centre for Military and Security Law and Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, the Jericho II has an estimated range of 1500 to 1800 kilometres, while the Jericho III can reach more than 4000 kilometres. Israel also operates a fleet of around half a dozen Dolphin-class diesel-electric submarines out of the northern port city of Haifa. A number of the German-built submarines are commonly thought to havebeen adaptedto carry cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads to maintain a second-strike option. “An estimated 30-40 nuclear weapons have been allocated to the submarines, with a possible missile delivery range of up to 1500 kilometres,” Prof Williams writes. While never openly acknowledging its capability, Israel has issued veiled threats in the past. “Our submarine fleet is used first and foremost to deter our enemies who strive to extinguish us,” Mr Netanyahu saidin 2016. “They must know that Israel is capable of hitting back hard against anyone who seeks to hurt us.” ‘Nuclear ambiguity’ Officially, Israel refuses to confirm or deny its secret nuclear weapons program, and is not party to the international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The policy, known as “nuclear ambiguity” or “nuclear opacity”, dates back more than five decades to a 1969 Oval Office meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and US President Richard Nixon, after nearly a decade of tension between the two countries over the issue. The two leaders reached an unwritten agreement that effectively amounted to “don’t ask, don’t tell” — Israel would agree not to declare, test or threaten to use nuclear weapons, and the US would not pressure Israel to sign the NPT, which had been co-sponsored and signed by the US the previous year. Despite this, Israel is suspected to have carried out an illegalnuclear testin 1979, roughly halfway between South Africa and Antarctica — an incident quickly swept under the rug by the Carter White House. Israel began developing its nuclear program in the 1950s and is believed to have produced its firstnuclear weaponin the late ‘60s. The US government had firstcaught windof Israel’s secret nuclear reactor — located in the Negev desert near the city of Dimona and built with the assistance of the French — in 1960. The Americans, fearful of a Middle East arms race, for several years put pressure on the Israelis to inspect Dimona, with Israel going so far as to build a fake control centre at the plant to mask its true purpose. “The Israelis, who are one of the few peoples whose survival is genuinely threatened, are probably more likely than almost any other country to actually use their nuclear weapons,” national security adviser Henry Kissinger told President Nixon in a declassified1969 memo. “This is one program on which the Israelis have persistently deceived us and may even have stolen from us.” Secret letter After the Oval Office meeting, “US policy toward Israeli nuclear weapons was indeed eased … but judging by Nixon’s memoirs, it was because he didn’t care much whether Israel had them”, former commissioner of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Victor Gilinsky wrote forBulletin of the Atomic Scientistsearlier this year. “His main interest was to gain Israeli support in the Cold War,”he said. “As to maintaining secrecy, they didn’t need a formal agreement. Nixon and Meir both understood a declared Israeli nuclear arsenal would have led to pressure on Moscow to provide their Arab allies with nuclear weapons.” Successive US presidents honoured this unwritten agreement until it was formalised into asecret letterduring the Clinton administration. According to a 2018 report inThe New Yorker, the letter — first signed by President Bill Clinton and known only to a handful of senior officials — amounted to an American pledge not to pressure Israel to give up its nuclear weapons as long as it continued to face existential threats in the region. “In the letter, according to former officials, President Bill Clinton assured the Jewish state that no future American arms-control initiative would ‘detract’ from Israel’s ‘deterrent’ capabilities, an oblique but clear reference to its nuclear arsenal,” investigative journalist Adam Entous wrote. “Later, Israeli officials inserted language to make clear to Washington that Israel would ‘defend itself, by itself’, and that it would, therefore, not consider the American nuclear arsenal to be a substitute for Israeli nuclear arms.” Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump each signed updated versions of the letter. Vanunu scandal The existence of Israel’s nuclear program was only revealed to the general public in 1986 when UK newspaperThe Sunday Timespublished a bombshell story featuring whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu, a former Dimona technician. Vanunu provided the paper with details and photos of the inner workings of the nuclear plant. “Based on his revelations, some experts estimated that Israel had built between 100 and 200 nuclear weapons of varying yields and complexity,” writes the Nuclear Threat Initiative. The Morocco-born nuclear technician lived in Australia briefly in 1986, where he converted to Christianity from Judaism. In September that year, he flew to London to tell his story to the media. But he was soon lured out of the UK by a female Mossad agent posing as an American tourist in a honey trap operation. She convinced him to fly to Rome, where he was drugged and abducted. Vanunu was flown back to Israel, where he was convicted of treason in a secret trial, spending 18 years behind bars. He was released in 2004 but was banned from travel or contact with foreigners without prior permission. Widely despised as a traitor in Israel, Vanunu was disavowed by most of his family,Reuters reportedupon his release. But he has also been celebrated as a hero by the global anti-nuclear movement and repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. “I’ve never known of a case where someone has been nominated for the Nobel Prize and convicted of treason at the same time,” ProfessorRichard Falk, an international law expert from Princeton University, toldThe Guardianafter Vanunu’s sentencing in 1988. ‘Doomsday weapon’ In the wake of the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas, which left 1400 Israelis dead and more than 240 taken hostage, fears have grown that any widening of the conflict could involve nuclear weapons. As of November 5, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza claims around 9800 people have been killed in Israel’s subsequent attacks, mostly civilians. Those figures have not been independently verified. Mr Eliyahu is not the first Israeli politician to suggest using “doomsday” weapons against the Palestinian terror group. “Jericho missile! Jericho missile! A strategic alert, before we consider introducing our forces. A doomsday weapon!” Revital Gotliv wrote in a post on X two days after the attacks. “This is my opinion. May God preserve all our strength.” Ms Gotliv, a member of Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party with a history of making inflammatory comments, wrote in a follow-up post that Israel should show no mercy in battling Hamas. “Only an explosion that shakes the Middle East will restore this country’s dignity, strength, and security! It’s time to kiss doomsday,” she said. “Shooting powerful missiles without limit. Not flattening a neighbourhood. Crushing and flattening Gaza. Otherwise, we would have done nothing. Not with passwords, with penetrating bombs. Without mercy! Without mercy!” The post was tagged with a disclaimer by the social media platform that its visibility had been limited as it “may violate X’s rules against Violent Speech”,Insider reported. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), warnedlast monththat “Israel’s possession of nuclear weapons significantly increases the risks associated with the conflict and contributes to regional tensions”. “Escalation is a real danger,” a spokeswoman toldThe South China Morning Post. frank.chung@news.com.au To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout “Risky behaviours” by China towards Australia could be pointing to a dangerous escalation which could blow up any moment.

Aussie ISIS brides to stay in Syria: court,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/fate-of-australian-women-and-children-in-syrian-refugee-camps-decided-in-federal-court/news-story/dc453be8751e02f54feb12b7cbcea011,"A legal battle to bring a group of Australian women and their children stuck in a refugee camp in Syria back home to Australia has been rejected by the Federal Court. A group of 20 Australian children and 11 women had been seeking to compel the federal government to repatriate them from North East Syria. On Friday, Justice Mark Moshinsky rejected the application brought by non-profit group Save the Children Australia, which acted as litigation guardian in the case, in the Federal Court. The application was made to formally request the Australian government to uphold its moral and legal obligation to repatriate its citizens. The Australian women, some of whom were children at the time, had travelled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters before the self-described caliphate collapsed in 2019. The women and their children have remained in a detention camp controlled by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES) since then. Thirty-four women and children with Australian citizenship, or eligibility for citizenship, remain in the Al-Roj camp in Northeast Syria, with 31 joining the lawsuit. Save the Children Australia Peter Morrissey SC had argued the government had a moral obligation to return the group who had endured “appalling conditions” for the past four years. During the court proceedings, the Australian government had argued AANES held “complete and unfettered discretion” over the detainees and therefore it couldn’t be compelled to repatriate them. “Merely being able to ask for a person’s release, and even having high hopes that would be successful, would never be enough,” counsel for the Commonwealth, Craig Lenehan SC, had previously told the court in September “Our fundamental point is the applicant fails to prove its case.” Mr Lenehan had told the court in September that there was never an “arrangement or agreement” made covering all the women and children despite a decision being made by political leaders to bring back the group in October. Justice Moshinsky said in his ruling on Friday that the government did not have “any such requirement” to make a decision about repatriation. Outside court, Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler said the organisation would consider its options in appealing the decision. “This is an extremely disappointing outcome, especially for the innocent Australian children who have already spent more than four years stranded in camps in Northeast Syria, wishing only for their government to bring them home to safety,” he said. “We respect the court’s decision but remain deeply concerned that these children will continue to be exposed to the risk of increasing violence and limited services such as adequate healthcare. “This will only add to the growing feeling these children have of being deserted by the Australian government. As each week, month and year in limbo passes, they are increasingly losing hope for the future.” Mr Tinkler said the government still had a responsibility to help its citizens. “Despite the outcome of this case, the government has the power to end this misery and pain for these children,” he said. “Australia must do the right thing and bring them home so that they can experience the opportunities and protections every Australian should receive. “More than 1500 foreign nationals have been repatriated from the camps since 2019, and many other countries didn’t need a court to tell them to do the right thing and repatriate their citizens – neither should Australia. “We will assess the judgment before making a final decision, but an appeal is absolutely being considered. We will continue doing everything we can to get these innocent children home, where they belong. “Save the Children won’t give up this fight. Someone has to stand in the corner of these innocent Australian children.” The reasons for the Federal Court decision will be kept confidential for seven days to allow the parties time to make further applications to the court, including costs. Save the Children had been seeking a writ of habeas corpus – which would require the Commonwealth to protect the women and children against unlawful and indefinite imprisonment in the camps. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Controversial son of Israel PM dodges war,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/yair-netanyahu-the-controversial-son-of-israel-prime-minister-dodges-war/news-story/e09b8a3c9f8b5a034c6f78c9829a739a,"Israelis are venting their frustration that Benjamin Netanyahu’s eldest son has not returned home to help the war effort. Around 360,000 Israeli army reservists have been called up following the bloody October 7 attack by Hamas. Israel’s armed forces are made up of a large number of reservists who have completed national service and can be called upon until the age of 40. Everyone is obliged to serve in the Israel Defence Force when they reach 18 years of age. Israelis have flocked home to help the war effort - from cutting short their honeymoon or uni studies. But Yair Netanyahu, 32, had steadfastly refused to return to Israel from Florida where he is now based. The millenial is no stranger to the public due to his prolific social media presence. On Instagram alone he boasts 110,000 followers and on X, formerly known as Twitter, 136,000 followers. “Yair is enjoying his life at Miami Beach while I’m on the front lines,” one reservist on Israel’s northern front told London’sThe Timesnewspaper. “It’s us who are leaving our work, our families, our kids, to protect our families back home and the country, not the people who are responsible for this situation. “Our brothers, our fathers, sons, are all going to the front line, but Yair is still not here. It does not help build trust in the leadership of the country.” Another lamented: “I’ve flown back from the States where I have a job, a life, my family. “There is no way I can stay there and abandon my country, my people, at this critical time. Where is the prime minister’s son? Why isn’t he in Israel? “It is the most uniting moment for us as Israelis in our recent history and every single one of us should be here right now, including the prime minister’s son.” Controversial past Yair was only four when his father became prime minister. He is considered one of his father’s closest political advisers, vital in helping the Israeli PM with his messaging in the online space. His own social media heavily defends his father and his policies – but not without controversy. He was banned from Facebook for 24 hours in 2018 after the social media network said he broke its rules on hate speech. Earlier this year, Yair was ordered by a judge to pay $AUD52,000 in compensation to a woman after he implied online she was having an affair with his father’s chief political opponent. “The insinuation that the young activist had an intimate relationship with the head of the party, a married man who is decades older than her, could humiliate her and make her a target of hatred, contempt or ridicule,” Judge Ronen Peleg wrote in the ruling, according to theindependent. The US State Department also criticised him for spreading a conspiracy theory that America was funding ongoing protests against his father’s controversial judicial reforms. More than 1400 Israelis have lost their lives in the deadly October 7 attacks. The Gazan health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, claims the Palestinian death toll has passed 9000, including 3760 children.

Hostage signs ripped down at Bondi Beach,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/police-investigating-israel-poster-attack-at-bondi/news-story/eb12345eff9ded772920ca41c659450e,"Two men were filmed ripping down posters of Israeli hostages at a vigil at Bondi Beach. More than 230 blue and white towels, the colours of the Israeli flag, were draped over the railings at Bondi Beach early on Thursday morning along with photographs of the hostages believed to be still in Gaza, and posters, saying “Kidnapped”. The grassroots vigil, organised by young Australian Jews to remember Israeli civilians kidnapped by terror group Hamas, descended into a shouting match after two men tore down posters showing the faces of kidnapped men, women and children. “Go away, go away, I’ll call the police,” one of the vigil attendees says to the two men. “What are you doing here?” The Australian Jewish Association posted the video to its social media channels. AJA CEO Robert Gregory, who attended the vigil but was not at the beach at the time of the incident, called the behaviour “unAustralian”. “The fact that some people would tear down pictures of kidnapped children, it’s a depraved way of thinking,” he said. A NSW police spokesman said officers from the Eastern Suburbs Police Area Command had commenced an investigation into the incident. “Following reports of the alleged incident at Bondi Beach earlier today and as investigations continue, anyone with info which might help police are asked to contact Waverly Police Station or Crimestoppers,” he said. The alleged incident follows an outburst of anti-Semitism at a pro-Palestine rally at the Sydney Opera House in early October, during which a group of men chanted “f**k the Jews” and “gas the Jews”. Community tensions have flared following the outbreak of war in Israel and Gaza. Six former Australian Prime Minister signed an open letter on October 30 calling on Australians to respect the country’s multicultural character. “Whatever is happening elsewhere in the world, there is no place in our country for racial or religious hatred,” the letter states. “And there is no more tenaciously evil race hatred than anti-Semitism.” Authorities have warned of “heavy” traffic and delays in a popular tourist strip after a multi-vehicle accident, believed to have involved a luxury car, forced the road to close.

"Israel’s three words that effect 18,500 workers",https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-a-reckoning-looming-for-benjamin-netanyahu-as-strikes-on-gaza-continue/news-story/2d97480d4ec0703620aeb54373d34523,"Welcome back to our live coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has made a closely watched speech to lay out the heavily armed anti-Israeli group’s next steps in the war. It is the influential chief’s first speech since the conflict began. There are concerns the Lebanon based militia could open a northern front. But he has distanced Hezbollah from the October 7 attacks saying they were “100 per cent Palestinian” organised. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said late on Thursday it had “completed the encirclement” of Gaza City, “the centre of the Hamas terror organisation”, following days of expanding ground operations in the besieged territory. Hamas’ military wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said in response that Gaza would be a “curse” for Israel and that its invading soldiers would go home “in black bags”. Thursday marked the 27th day of the conflict sparked by the October 7 attacks when Hamas terrorists stormed the border, killing 1400 people and kidnapping more than 240, Israeli officials say. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza claims more than 9000 people have been killed in Israel’s subsequent attacks, including 3760 children. Those figures have not been independently verified. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today to discuss measures to protect civilians, as global aid organisations continue calls for an immediate ceasefire. Read on for the latest updates. ‘Some would like us to join a war’: Hezbollah chief In a highly anticipated speech, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has threatened more attacks on Israe - and that its actions could escalate - but he did not declare war which there concerns he might. “Some claim Hezbollah is about to join the fray. I tell you: We have been engaged in this battle since October 8. “Some would like Hezbollah to engage in an all-out war, but I can tell you: What is happening now along the Israeli-Lebanese border is significant, and it is not the end. “We have been targeting Israeli soldiers, tanks, drones and sensors, the eyes and ears of Israel. We have been engaged in a true battle. The amount of our martyrs (dead militias) — 57 — testifies to this,” he says. But he warned, Hezbollah’s stance could change depending on Israel’s actions in Gaza” “The possibility of the Lebanese front escalating into broad battle is a realistic option”. “All scenarios are open”. Nasrallah added the IDF had been forced to divert forces, weapons and equipment to the north. “One-third of the IDF is now amassed on our border,” he claims, although it’s not Hezbollah as the group does not rule Lebanon. He also warned Israel against a “pre-emptive attack” against Hezbollah. “It will be the most foolish mistake you make in your entire existence”. He called for a ceasefire and warned Israel about further actions in Gaza. “I tell Israel: Do not go any further. Many civilians have already died. I promise you: A civilian for a civilian.” Hezbollah chief’s surprising reveal In a surprise revelation, Nasrallah distanced Hezbollah from the October 7 attacks. “This was 100 per cent Palestinian,” he said on Friday, Lebanon time. “The international community keeps bringing up Iran and its military plans, but the October 7 attack was a 100 per cent Palestinian operation, planned and executed by Palestinians for the Palestinian cause, it has no relation at all to any international or regional issues.” “This element of secrecy was the linchpin to the shocking success.” Nonetheless, Nasrallah basked in the attack’s results and said the outcomes of the attack were profound and showed how ”weak” Israel was. “The glorious operation,” exposed “the frailty, weakness and total fragility of Israel … it’s more fragile than a spider’s web”. Hezbollah blames US for Gaza war Nasrallah has said the US, not Israel or Hamas, was “responsible” for the current conflict. “The United States is completely responsible for the war raging in Gaza … It is the US that must pay the price for the crimes perpetrated in Gaza.” That will raise fears of possible attacks on US bases within the Middle East or terrorist attacks elsewhere. “If an all-out war breaks out, you Americans will pay with your ships, your aircraft and your soldiers,” he threatened. “Only you Americans can end what is happening now in Gaza, since you started it.” ‘Drunk’: Hezbollah leader’s bizarre claim During his speech Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah made the preposterous claim that most of the 1400 victims on October 7 were killed by “drunk” Israeli soldiers. That’s despite Hamas militants in some cases gloating over their kills and footage of gunmen shooting Israelis. IDF soldiers were “acting insanely as they were caught by surprise and were drunk,” he said, reportedThe Times of Israel. Nasrallah also said that Israel “cannot achieve” its goal of eliminating Hamas. “Among the gravest mistakes committed by the enemy in the past is setting high goals that they cannot achieve. They set as the top goal to annihilate Hamas, the whole of Hamas”. A number of commentators have shared that observation – that even if Israel destroys Hamas’ command centres, tunnels and top commanders, it will still continue to exist in some capacity. Israel on ‘very, very’ high alert state ahead of speech. Israel has said it is on a “very, very high” alert level at its northern border with Lebanon due as concerns ramp up that a new front could open in the war. The Head of militant group Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah gave a speech today (Friday local time). Hezbollah is based in Lebanon but its forces are separate to the Lebanese armed forces. There have already been skirmishes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah forces at the border since the Israel-Gaza war began. If Hezbollah increase attacks, or declares war, it will mean Israel will have to fight Hamas to the south and Hezbollah to the north. But Tel Aviv has said its up for the fight. “We are at a very high level of readiness in the north – on a very, very high level of alertness to respond to any event that occurred today and in the days to come,” Israeli Defence Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said. Blinken in Israel seeking ‘concrete steps’ to reduce Gaza civilian harm US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Friday in a trip focused on measures to minimise harm to civilians in the war in Gaza. The office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted pictures of the meeting between the Israeli PM and Blinken. It posted on X: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now holding a private meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv. “They will also meet with the members of the War Cabinet.” Blinken is on his third visit to the country since the deadly Hamas attacks on 7 October. Prior to his departure from the US, Blinken said he would seek “concrete steps” from Israel to ensure that harm to Palestinian civilians is reduced, as US President Joe Biden also called for humanitarian pauses in the conflict. This is Blinken’s second trip to the Middle East since fighting erupted on October 7. “We will be talking about concrete steps that can and should be taken to minimise harm to men, women and children in Gaza,” Blinken told reporters before departing for Israel. “This is something that the United States is committed to.” “When I see a Palestinian child — a boy, a girl — pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child in Israel or anywhere else,” Blinken said. “So this is something that we have an obligation to respond to, and we will.” Biden promises ramped up military aid Biden has promised full support and ramped-up military aid to Israel for its campaign in Gaza, but in a visible shift of tone has also voiced empathy for Palestinian suffering which has stoked anger in parts of the world. “I think we need a pause,” Biden said on Thursday at a campaign event. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby later clarified what such a pause would entail. “A humanitarian pause … is temporary, localised and focused, focused on a particular objective or objectives, humanitarian aid in, people out,” Kirby told reporters UN reveals huge figure required to assist Gaza civilians The UN on Friday launched an emergency aid appeal seeking $1.2 billion to help some 2.7 million people in Gaza and the West Bank. “The cost of meeting the needs of 2.7 million people – that is the entire population of Gaza and 500,000 people in the occupied West Bank – is estimated to be $1.2 billion,” the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said. “The original appeal, launched 12 October, asked for $294 million to support nearly 1.3 million people. The situation has grown increasingly desperate since then,” it added. It came after Israel began sending thousands of Palestinian workers back to Gaza who had been stranded inside Israel since its war with Hamas erupted, a Gaza border official said. “Thousands of workers who were blocked in Israel since October 7 have been brought back,” Hisham Adwan, head of Gaza’s crossings authority, told AFP. AFPTV footage shot early on Friday showed groups of workers arriving through the Karem Abu Salem crossing between Israel and southern Gaza, which is normally only used for goods. Israel ‘severs all contact’ with 18,500 workers The Israeli government has announced that thousands of Gazans working in Israel will be sent back to the region under siege, as part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s bold retaliation plan following the October 7 attacks. “Israel is severing all contact with Gaza. There will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza. Those workers from Gaza who were in Israel on the day of the outbreak of the war will be returned to Gaza,” a post from Mr Netanyahu’s office on X, formerly Twitter, said. Israel’s security cabinet has also made moves to “deduct all funds designated for the Gaza Strip … from Palestinian Authority [PA] funds”. Prior to the current conflict, approximately 18,500 Palestinians from Gaza had been given permits to enter Israel. White House grilled on Qatar role A senior White House official has bristled during a tense grilling over what is possibly the biggest elephant in the room of the conflict — the role of Qatar in continuing to give shelter to Hamas. Speaking about getting Americans out of Gaza, US President Joe Biden recently said he wanted to “thank our partners in the region and particularly Qatar”. “The leader of Hamas lives in Qatar, so why is President Biden thanking them for anything?” Fox News reporter Peter Doocy asked White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby at Thursday’s briefing. “Oh geez, Peter — take a step back here and look at this,” Mr Kirby said. He insisted Qatar had “been helpful” in getting American hostages, Judith Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter Natalie, releasedlast month. “I’m sure you would agree with me and everybody at your network would agree that getting the hostages out is a good thing, and Qatar was key player in that regard,” he said. “Qatar has lines of communication [with Hamas] that not everybody else has and it would be irresponsible … if we weren’t doing everything we could and having every possible conversation we can have to get Americans that are held hostage back home with their families.” Doocy asked, “If Qatar is so helpful, why aren’t we asking them to hand over the leader of this terrorist group?” “We are working with Qatar to get our people out and to help get aid in,” Mr Kirby said. “That’s a priority right now and, obviously, we’re also helping Israel go after Hamas.” Writing inThe Wall Street Journalthis week, former National Security Council officialRichard Goldbergsaid the US must issue an ultimatum for Qatar to “stop sheltering Hamas”. “More than three weeks after the October 7 atrocities, Qatar still plays host to Hamas’ ‘political’ leaders, allowing the terror group to co-ordinate with Iran and pump its propaganda throughout the world,” Mr Goldberg said. “Doha says its relationship with Hamas benefits the US and Israel, providing a channel to negotiate the release of hostages held in Gaza. Rather than indulge this charade, the White House and Congress should issue an ultimatum to Qatar — shut down all support for Hamas and deliver the hostages, or suffer the consequences.” Claims razor blades placed on posters Unverified video circulating on social media purports to show a woman whose fingers were cut by razor blades after attempting to tear down posters of kidnapped Israelis. The posters featuring images of some of the more than 200 Israelis being held by Hamas have been put up in cities around the world, but have emerged as amajor flashpointas Palestinian supporters tear them down, often sparking heated confrontations. “Guys, these people are putting razors in these papers because people are snatching them out, and this is what’s going on right now,” an unidentified woman says in the video. She shows her fingers with what appears to be blood on them and holds up torn scraps of posters with razor blades stuck to the back. “Tell me who the f**k the real terrorist is,” she says. “Who does this? Who puts razors on f**king papers? People are snatching them out because we know where the terrorism is coming from. Six thousand dead kids, OK? Now let’s sue the s**t out of them.” The original source of the video wasn’t immediately clear. It was shared by the Instagram account@miamiproblemssand reported by influencer Ian Miles Cheong to X, where it has been viewed more than 8 million times. “That’s one way of dealing with people who rip down posters,”he wrote. One person commented, “I agree that no one should take down the posters, but there should not be any razors on these posters either.” “Public booby traps are highly illegal,” another said. But some questioned whether the footage was real. “Looks fake to me,” one said. Hezbollah leader to give major speech Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is set to give his first public speech on Friday since the war began, sparking fears the conflict is about widen. Footage posted to social media showed a massive, elaborate stage being prepared in Beirut for Nasrallah’s speech, with hundreds of chairs for audience members. The speech is reportedly scheduled for 3pm local time on Friday (midnight AEDT). Hezbollah has released a series of short, cryptic videos featuring Nasrallah in recent days, hinting the Hamas ally is preparing to join the fight against Israel. “This is Nasrallah’s moment,” Mohannad Hage Ali, an expert on Lebanon with the Carnegie Middle East Center,told Al Jazeera. “Millions of Arabs will be watching his speech across the world. They will listen to the only leader in the region that is capable of speaking to their anger and despair by telling them that he will act and support Palestinians in Gaza, who face an existential threat of expulsion.” Mr Hage Ali said Hezbollah “views this conflict as an existential one”. “They think that if Israel manages to meet its objectives in eradicating Hamas in the Gaza Strip, then they will turn around and deal with what they see as the Hezbollah threat,” he said. It comes as the Israeli military said it had targeted Lebanon’s Hezbollah with a “broad assault” on Thursday in which “warplanes and helicopters” attacked Hezbollah targets “in response to fire from Lebanese territory earlier today, together with attacks with artillery and tank fire”. The Iran-backed militant group said four of its fighters died in the strikes, after announcing it had attacked 19 Israeli positions simultaneously. The Israel-Lebanon border has seen escalating tit-for-tat exchanges, mainly between the Israeli army and Hezbollah. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday as he departed for another Middle East diplomatic tour that the United States was “determined to deter any escalation”. White House National Security Council spokesmanJohn Kirbytold reporters that the US hadn’t “seen any indication” that Hezbollah was ready to fully join the war against Israel and was still “concerned about continued attacks on Israeli forces in the north” by the group. Mr Kirby added the US would be following the highly anticipated speech. Intense images of night-time bombardment Apocalyptic live images of Gaza on Thursday night showed Israel intensifying its aerial bombardment of the territory. Flares and explosions illuminated the skies of northern Gaza, footage aired by CNN showed. Watching from Sderot, Israel, CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson said he saw flares raining down for more than half an hour in some of the most intense volume since October 7. Robertson said the focus of the attack appeared to be in the area of Beit Hanoun, near Gaza City, which has traditionally experienced the first military moves by the IDF in past operations, according to the network. He said it appeared two rockets were fired out of Gaza during this time and artillery fire was also heard nearby. There also appeared to be a smoke screen covering the ground, suggesting possible troop movement. Senior Israeli government adviser Mark Regev told the broadcaster he could not provide details as the operation was ongoing, but said the military was keeping up pressure on Hamas. “We are hitting its military machine,” he said. “Our goal is to destroy Hamas’ military machine and to dismantle its political control over Gaza.” Israel weighing brief ceasefire Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering US requests for a short humanitarian ceasefire of several hours, Hebrew-language outletKan Newsreports. It comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due in Israel on Friday to discuss a possible ceasefire and other measures to protect civilians. The US on Thursday called for humanitarian pauses in the conflict that would involve “temporary, localised” cessation of hostilities — well short of a general ceasefire. At a campaign event on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden was urged by a member of the audience to call for a ceasefire in the war. “I think we need a pause,” Mr Biden replied. Talking to reporters on Thursday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby clarified what such a pause would entail. “A humanitarian pause … is temporary, localised and focused, focused on a particular objective or objectives, humanitarian aid in, people out,” Mr Kirby said. Mr Blinken said he would be seeking “concrete measures” from Israel to protect Gaza civilians as he headed on his second crisis trip to the Middle East since the war broke out. But the US opposes calls from across the Arab world and some European allies for a ceasefire, saying Hamas has no intention of stopping attacks and would only use a truce to regroup. “When I see a Palestinian child — a boy, a girl — pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child in Israel or anywhere else,” Mr Blinken said. “So this is something that we have an obligation to respond to, and we will.” Hamas sending texts to hostage families Families of civilian hostages held in Gaza have been receiving text messages in Hebrew purporting to be from Hamas, Israeli media are reporting. The messages reportedly ask the recipients to click a link to receive information on the hostages, Hebrew-language outletKan Newsreports, viaThe Times of Israel. “This is a message from Al-Qassam,” reads the message, referring to Hamas’ military wing. “We have offered your government a prisoner swap, but it was not accepted. This is our message: the release of all Zionist prisoners in exchange for the release of all Palestinian prisoners.” The Israeli army is seeking to free around 240 hostages, both civilians and troops, captured by Hamas during the October 7 attacks. The Palestinian terror group’s brutal incursion into southern Israel claimed 1400 lives and was the worst attack in the country’s 75-year history. IDF has ‘completed encirclement’ of Gaza City Israel’s military said on Thursday its forces have surrounded the Hamas stronghold of Gaza City after a day that saw the Palestinian territory pounded by deadly fire. The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, warned Israel its invading soldiers would go home “in black bags”. “Gaza will be the curse of history for Israel,” spokesman Abu Obeida said. The Hamas warning came after Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops had completely surrounded Gaza City after days of expanding ground operations. “Israeli soldiers have completed the encirclement of the city of Gaza, the centre of the Hamas terror organisation,” Mr Hagari told journalists. “The concept of a ceasefire is not currently on the table at all.” In northern Gaza, ground fighting flared again overnight as Israeli troops battled Hamas. Israeli army chief of staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said troops were inside Gaza, besieging Gaza City and “deepening infiltration” of Hamas-held areas. “Israeli soldiers are fighting face-to-face with a brutal enemy,” he told reporters. The Israeli army is also seeking to free around 240 hostages, both civilians and troops, captured by Hamas during the attacks. Some 332 soldiers have already died in the October 7 attacks and in the Israeli offensive the Hamas assault triggered. Now gruelling urban warfare lies ahead deeper inside Gaza, where Hamas is fighting from a tunnel network spanning hundreds of kilometres. Amid growing fears of the conflict spreading, Israel and Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon exchanged fire after a salvo of rockets slammed into a northern Israel town. As he left on a new Middle East visit, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would work to avoid escalation of the Israel-Hamas war. “We’ve been very clear in some of the actions we’re taking that we are determined to deter any escalation,” Mr Blinken said. President Joe Biden says the US supports a humanitarian “pause” in the conflict to relieve pressure on civilians but opposes calls for a ceasefire, saying Hamas has no intention of holding fire and Israel has a right to defend itself. Hezbollah said it attacked 19 Israeli positions along the border simultaneously on Thursday, ahead of a speech by its leader Hassan Nasrallah on the Israel-Hamas war. The Israeli military said “warplanes and helicopters attacked in recent hours targets of the Hezbollah terror organisation in response to fire from Lebanese territory earlier today, together with attacks with artillery and tank fire”. Australian grapples with impossible choice Among the foreign nationals currently stuck in Gaza is 77-year-old Abdallah Dahalaan, an Australian citizen. He and his wife, not a citizen but an Australian visa holder, made it to the Rafah crossing — the only way across the Strip’s border with Egypt. Mr Dahalaan was told he could pass through the crossing. His wife could not. The Sydney Morning Heraldreports that he facedan agonising, near impossible choice — whether to return home to his children, or remain in Gaza with his wife. “I want my kids to understand that I couldn’t leave my wife behind,” Mr Dahalaan said. “Their father had to do the right thing.” He does not intend to make the “dangerous” trip to the Rafah crossing again unless he knows for certain that his wife will be allowed passage as well. Hamas stockpiles fuel as civilians suffer For days we’ve been reporting on the severe fuel shortage in Gaza, which has left residents without power and caused hospitals to shut down. Meanwhile, as NBCnow reports, Hamas has been keeping a stockpile of more than 200,000 gallons (about 750,000 litres) of fuel for itself, to power the rockets it is firing into Israel and the generators that keep its network of underground tunnels functioning. That figure is only an estimate — but the amount of fuel being stockpiled is certainly immense. “Hamas has its own supply stockpile of fuel,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his country’s Senate on Tuesday. “If it cared a whit about the people of Gaza, it would make sure itself that it used that fuel to have the hospitals be able to operate the incubators, stay turned on. But of course, it doesn’t.” An Israeli academic with expertise in energy, Elai Rettig, told NBC “we don’t know much they have”. “We definitely don’t know how much they need, because no one is sure to what extent this underground city goes,” Professor Rettig said. “If it’s just for ventilation and basic communication, it will last for months.” Israel reportedly strikes another refugee camp The Associated Press and Al Jazeera report that Israel has struck the Bureij refugee camp, which is located in the middle of the Gaza Strip. Bureij, home to about 46,000 registered refugees, is smaller than the Jabalia camp, which has been hit by multiple air strikes targeting Hamas figures and infrastructure this week. The death toll from the Bureij strike is reportedly 15, though that may grow, with dozens more people trapped under the rubble of damaged buildings. “My family and I were sitting, and all of a sudden we heard a huge explosive. Everything was flying around us. We couldn’t see anything but dust and smoke,” a survivor told Al Jazeera. “It was massive. The whole area is turned upside down. “That was my home. Now it is totally in ruins. I do not know what to say. We are helpless.” Medical teams are reportedly struggling to access the site, leaving residents to try to move the rubble themselves. “My two sisters, along with all their children,” another survivor, who was trying to shift rubble, said. “We are helpless. We cannot remove this heavy concrete. It is too late, even if we find them. They must be dead by now.” Biden thinks Netanyahu’s days ‘numbered’ According to American newssite Politico, US President Joe Biden believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s time in office will end soon, and has discussed the matter with his staff – including in the period since he visited Israel and met with the PM. The President has reportedly told Mr Netanyahu directly that she should start to think about the lessons he will share with whoever succeeds him. Mr Netanyahu is his country’s longest serving prime minister and has survived multiple scandals in the past, including corruption allegations. But the Israeli public has largely turned on him since Hamas’s attack on October 7. “There’s going to have to be a reckoning within Israeli society about what happened,” a current US official told Politico, having been granted anonymity to discuss their private conversations. “Ultimately, the buck stops on the Prime Minister’s desk.” Polling has shown up to 80 per cent of Israelis hold Mr Netanyahu responsible for thesecurity failuresthat enabled Hamas’s attack. He has also been accused of trying tododge responsibilityby pinning the blame for Hamas’s assault on Israel’s national security apparatuses. During his visit to Israel last month, Mr Biden publicly expressed support for the nation’s right to defend itself. However, in private, he reportedly urged Mr Netanyahu to act with caution, and to prioritise a peaceful two-state solution in the long term. We should note that, after Politico’s story was published, a spokesman for the Biden administration’s National Security Council denied that Mr Netanyahu’s future had been discussed. The publication’s sources stand by their information. ‘Pay attention’ to Hamas’ words The United States has responded to the disturbing remarks from Hamas official Ghazi Hamad, in which he reaffirmed the terrorist group’s commitment to “annihilating” Israel and promised more attacks like the one on October 7. “That is what’s at stake for the Israeli people. That is what’s at stake for the people of Gaza,” National Security Council official John Kirby said of Hamad’s interview. “Hamas is willing to continue this fight, and will continue to try to slaughter innocent Israelis. “Those are chilling comments. We ought to pay attention to them.” Speaking to LBC International, Hamad said Hamas “must teach Israel a lesson, and we will do this again and again”. “The Al-Aqsa Flood (Hamas’s name for the attack on October 7) is just the first time. And there will be a second, a third, a fourth. Because we have the determination, the resolve, the capabilities to fight. “Will we have to pay a price? Yes, and we are ready to pay it. “The existence of Israel is what causes all that pain, blood and tears. It is Israel, not us. We are the victims of the occupation. Period. Therefore, nobody should blame us for the things we do … everything we do is justified.” ‘Appalling’ conditions in UN shelters The UNRWA, which is the United Nations agency responsible for helping Palestinian refugees, has again warned that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is “desperate”. “Some 690,000 internally displaced people are sheltering in 149 UNRWA installations,” the organisation said. “Our shelters are at almost four times their intended capacity, and overcrowded conditions continue to create severe health and protection concerns.” The agency says 70 of its workers have been killed so far, which is “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”. Its Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, finally managed to enter Gaza himself yesterday, where he visited one of the UN shelters. “He was in one of our shelters. There were thousands of people. This is a UN shelter that was indirectly hit during the war,” Juliette Touma, the UNRWA’s director of communications, told CNN afterwards. “The sanitary conditions are appalling, according to him. People live on the very, very basic — little bread and whatever is left of some water. “Our staff are dedicated, they keep going, but they are also finding it extremely challenging to operate, giving out the little humanitarian supplies that have been coming into Gaza.” — with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Albo dodges call for Israel-Hamas ceasefire,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/relief-for-australians-stuck-in-gaza-as-20-allowed-to-cross-into-egypt/news-story/e56986c62839598bdf50e4905d559880,"Anthony Albanese has stopped short of calling for a ceasefire in Israel’s war on Hamas but says a pause is required to allow aid into Gaza. The Prime Minister did not shift too far from previous rhetoric when asked at The Australian-Melbourne Institute Economic and Social Outlook conference if it was now time for a ceasefire. But in the wake of an Israeli strike in a densely populated part of Gaza, Mr Albanese said the civilian toll is “quite rightly” causing enormous concern around the world. “We said a week ago that there was a need for a pause for humanitarian concerns and that remains our position,” Mr Albanese said. He said Israel had an obligation to “do all it can to ensure that innocent civilians are not paying the price of Hamas’ atrocities” and to consider broader consequences. “It is critical as well that this war does not expand into other theatres; the consequences of that for Israel’s security are dire,” Mr Albanese added. “Israel needs to recognise that in the way that it conducts itself, because the images that have been seen of the (Jabalia) refugee camp, quite rightly, will cause an enormous, enormous concern around the world.” Hamas’s cross-border assault on October 7 killed at least 1400 people and 240 people were taken hostage. Israel has since closed the borders to the territory, launched a ground assault and the continued bombardment has killed at least 8700 people. Mr Albanese said he understood Hamas operations within civilian infrastructure made the Israeli operation difficult but “every effort” needed to be made to protect civilian life. His comments come just hours after US President Joe Biden called on Israel to pause fighting for humanitarian aid during a campaign event in Minneapolis. After weeks of waiting to secure a phone hook up, Mr Albanese spoke with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. The call came ahead of the confirmation that 20 Australians, as well as two family members and a permanent resident, had escaped from the besieged territory. The brief reopening of the Rafah crossing occurred after a deal was brokered by Qatar between Israel, Hamas and Egypt. Rafah is the sole border crossing between Gaza and Egypt and is the only Gaza border crossing that isn’t controlled by Israel. Around 350 foreign passport holders were granted permission to leave Gaza for the first time since the Israel-Hamas conflict began. Foreign Minister Penny Wong confirmed the group of 23 had been met by Australian consular officials who assisted with onward travel to Cairo. Travel arrangements are being made for them to get home free of charge. “Just a short while ago, I spoke to Australia’s ambassador to Egypt, Dr Axel Wabenhorst. It was about 4am in Cairo and I can tell you I was speaking to him and I could hear children in the background and I said to him ‘are they our kids’ and he said ‘yes – some of the Australian children who made it to Cairo today,’” she told reporters in Adelaide. “They had a seven-hour journey which is obviously pretty tiring. I asked about the health of all of the Australians. “He said that people seemed in good health and were relieved but we are ensuring anyone who needs medical attention will receive it.” A further 65 people, a mix of Australian citizens, permanent residents and their family members who are registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, remain in Gaza. The head of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network Nasser Mashni said there is “very little hope” for people in Gaza. “We believe 60 Australians are still left in Gaza. But there are over two million Palestinians that are held in what can only be described as a slaughterhouse,” he told Sunrise. “Those Palestinians without Western passports, they can’t get out.” Meanwhile, more than 15,000 Australians remain in nearby Lebanon despite repeated warnings from the government for them to leave amid fears the war could spiral into a wider regional conflict. There are currently no plans for repatriation flights from Lebanon and Assisurged people to leave via commercial options available. “Our strong advice to Australians in Lebanon is to take the option to leave now,” Mr Watts said. “We can‘t make any guarantees that Beirut airport will remain open if the conflict spreads to the south of Lebanon and departure options become much more complex.” To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

’Holy war’: Israeli PM’s chilling warning,https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/oldtime-religion-netanyahu-invokes-scripture-as-hamas-fight-becomes-israels-holy-war/news-story/be3a19446c5e151e087e77b20ebdf145,"Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of declaring a “holy war” against Gaza by supporters of Palestine, with the right-wing leader continuing to invoke religious themes in the escalating battle against Hamas. Critics say the tactic shows the leader is intentionally appealing to the Orthodox faction of his cabinet and drawing on “old time” ideas of religious battles to rally support. In a televised address on Saturday night announcing the ground invasion of Gaza, the Israeli Prime Minister likened Hamas to the nation of Amalek — the biblical arch-enemy of the Israelites. “You must remember what Amalek has done to you,’ says our Holy Bible — and we do remember, and we are fighting,” he said. Mr Netanyahu was quoting from Deutreonomy, the fifth book of the Torah — which is made up of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. In a news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu again invoked the Bible as he insisted there would be no ceasefire. “The Bible says, ‘There is a time for peace, and a time for war.’ This is a time for a war,” he said,referencing Ecclesiastes, another section of the Hebrew Bible. Israel has intensified its air and ground operations against Hamas in Gaza following a bloody attack by the Palestinian terror group more than three weeks ago that Israeli authorities say killed at least 1400 people, mostly civilians. More than220 hostagesare still being held in Gaza by Hamas after being captured in shockingly violent raids across southern Israel. Since the October 7 attack, the Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip claims more than 8300 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s relentless retaliatory bombardments, half of them children. Those numbers have not been independently verified. Not a ‘true believer’ Professor Joe Siracusa, Dean of Global Futures at Curtin University, said Mr Netanyahu’s Biblical references were likely an appeal to the right-wing Orthodox arm of his cabinet, and a reflection of the influence of his father, Benzion Netanyahu, a renowned biblical scholar. “I think he’s going back to his taproots — he’s drawing up this aura of battle,” he said. “Words mean a lot to him, so he’s going back to that old-time religion.” The “big problem” facing the PM, Prof Siracusa argued, was selling the war to the public. “Even Jesus and Moses had to sell the program, right? We’ve got TV screens, we can see what’s happening,” he said. “His 300,000 reservists, they’re professional soldiers. They haven’t been trained to kill children. They’re way outside their comfort zone.” Professor Siracusa explained this has left Mr Netanyahu needing to invoke “mighty images” for Israelis, and is trying to “give the guys something to think about”. He described it as “part propaganda and part biblical injunction”. “They’ve all read the Bible,” he said. “Israelis, no matter how secular, have to listen to this stuff in synagogue. I don’t think he’s a true believer. He doesn’t strike me as a particularly sensitive guy … [but] he’s surrounded by people who are true believers.” Dr Jessica Genauer, senior lecturer in international relations at Flinders University, agreed that Mr Netanyahu’s recent biblical references were “intended primarily to appeal to constituencies within the Israeli domestic political landscape”. “Netanyahu is in a governing coalition with religious and nationalist political parties for whom biblical references are likely to resonate,” she said. Dr Genauer explained that the leader was coming under increasing criticism and pressure from domestic opposition for his response to the October 7 attacks. “In particular there are questions regarding whether Netanyahu is sufficiently focused on the release of hostages from Gaza as a priority objective,” she said. “Netanyahu is attempting to shore up his own political base within the Israeli domestic context.” But Prof Siracusa said the other key audience for the comments was America. “He is a Zionist, he knows that the support he has out there in the world, particular in the US, comes from Christian Zionists,” he said. “Zionism and Christian Zionism have a lot in common, in that they’re anchored to the Bible. We’re not talking about New Testament, turning-the-other-cheek stuff, these guys are all Old Testament.” The evangelicals in the US “believe that according to Revelation, Israel must be standing on the last day so they can be converted”, he explained, saying this belief in Biblical end-times prophecy was concerning. “I spend a lot of time thinking and writing about nuclear weapons,” he said. “Guys like [former US Secretary of State] Mike Pompeo, who are born-again Christians, don’t give a s**t about speeding up the end of times. They’re not afraid.” Who are the Amalek? In his speech on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu said Israeli soldiers fighting Hamaswere joininga chain of Jewish heroes. Describing a history that “started 3000 years ago”, he compared today’s combatants to Joshua ben Nun, who succeeded Moses in leading the Israelites, as well as to “the heroes of 1948, the Six-Day War” of 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of October 1973. “Our heroic soldiers have one supreme goal — to completely destroy the murderous enemy and to ensure our existence in our land,”he said. “We have always said ‘never again’. ‘Never again’ is now.” In the Bible, the Amalekites were the “first nation to attack the Jewish people after the Exodus from Egypt, and they are seen as the archetypal enemy of the Jews”,Chabad.org explains. Jewish tradition contains commandments,or mitzvot, derived from the Hebrew Bible, to “obliterate the nation of Amalek” and to “never forget the evil deeds Amalek did” — in reference to Deuteronomy. London-based pro-Palestinian not-for-profit Middle East Monitor (MEMO) claimed Mr Netanyahu had “[declared] holy war against Gaza, citing the Bible”,writing that“critics have highlighted that the text in the Hebrew Bible which addresses revenge on the Amalek constitutes a narrative of ‘genocide’”. The passagefrom Samuelreferenced, in which the prophet commands King Saul to wipe out the Amalek, reads, “Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.” ButBreitbartsenior editor-at-largeJoel Pollakargued the Israeli PM was being misquoted and that he “specifically quoted Deuteronomy, not Samuel”, which urges, “Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt; how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.” Pollak said on X, “No particular group today is ‘Amalek’ but it is a familiar Jewish idea to fight those who, like the Nazis and Hamas, attack the most vulnerable.” The story of the Amalek is the subject of a special Shabbat — holy days which have specific Torah readings associated with them — called Shabbat Zakhor, the Hebrew word for “remember”. “The reading for Shabbat Zakhor is very troubling for many Jews: a passage commanding us to remember the treachery of Amalek and to blot out their memory,” writes Tracey Rich fromJudaism 101. “Many find this commandment troubling because, in ordering us to ‘blot out the remembrance of Amalek’, it appears to advocate genocide, killing people because of their race.” But she explained that “the sages have long understood the commandment in Parshat Zakhor as a command to blot out the type of people that Amalek represents: those that prey upon the weak, those who do not believe in justice, those who hate without reason”. “The sages use the term ‘Amalek’ as a shorthand for vicious, evil people who behave like mad dogs, in much the same way that many people today casually toss around the term ‘Nazi’ to refer to anyone they disagree with rather than to Germans or members of the National Socialist Party,” she said. “It is these evil people that we are commanded to destroy, the sages say, not any specific ethnic group.” ‘Prophecy of Isaiah’ The latest comments come after Mr Netanyahu last week invoked an apocalyptic Old Testament prophecy often linked to the Second Coming of Christ in a televised speech about the war against Hamas. In a night-time address last Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu described the war as a battle of “light” versus “darkness” and said Israel would “realise the prophecy of Isaiah”. “Our war against Hamas is a test for all of humanity, it is a struggle between the axis of evil of Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, and the axis of freedom and progress,”he said, according to a translation by Israel’si24 News. “We are the people of the light, they are the people of darkness, and light shall triumph over darkness.” The PM said his responsibility was to guarantee the future of the country and lead Israel to an “overpowering victory”. “It is now a time to come together for one purpose, to storm ahead to achieve victory,” he said. “With joint forces and a profound belief in our justness, a profound belief in the eternity of the Jewish people, we shall realise the prophecy of Isaiah.” Isaiah was anIsraelite prophetwho lived in the 8th century BC. In addition to foreshadowing the coming of the Messiah, interpreted by Christians in the New Testament to be Jesus Christ, Isaiah’s prophecies cover the worldwide persecution of Jews andthe restorationof Israel. Mr Netanyahu has previously quoted the Book of Isaiah in public speeches, telling the United Nations in 2017 that Israel is “a light unto the nations, bringing salvation to the ends of the earth”. Writing for Bloomberglast week, Professor of History at the University of Georgia, Stephen Mihm, noted that many American evangelical Christians see the Israel-Hamas war as “part of a prophecy” linked to the Second Coming of Christ. “Israel first became central to evangelical eschatology four centuries ago, when Protestant theologians, especially those of a millenarian bent, seized upon very specific passages about the end times,” Prof Mihm said. “For example, in the Old Testament, the prophet Isaiah predicted that God ‘shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth’.” This was interpreted “to mean that the return of Christ would take place once the Jewish diaspora returned to Palestine”. “Eager to put God’s plan in motion, these Christian Zionists — not an oxymoron — began to push their governments to take active steps to get Jews back to Palestine,” Prof Mihm said. ‘The final conflict’ Faith-based Christian Zionists, who “seek to influence American policy toward Israel, fervently believe that Christ cannot return until biblical prophecies in books such as Zechariah, Daniel, and the Book of Revelation are fulfilled”, former senior Australian military officer and author Adrian d’Hage wrote in 2015. “Such prophecy includes the return of all of the Promised Land (including Gaza and the West Bank) to Israel. Many Christian Zionists believe we are now in the end times and awaiting the Second Coming of Christ.” This group follows the biblical tenet from Genesis that God promises to “bless those who bless Israel and to curse those who are against Israel”, meaning “if America supports Israel, then God will support America”, d’Hage added. According to Prof Mihm, following Israel’s triumph over its neighbours in the Six-Day War of 1967, evangelicals “felt increasingly confident” that Israel embodied the “final countdown” to Armageddon. “All that remained was for Israel to secure a final victory over its enemies and rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem,” he said. “And then, if the prophets were right, some pretty unpleasant things would happen — a false messiah known as the Antichrist would take over Jerusalem and install himself as the saviour before inaugurating the Tribulation, a seven-year period of death and destruction, with most Jews perishing. “Finally, Jesus would return to earth, overthrowing the pretender and inaugurating a thousand-year reign of peace on earth.” Prof Mihm said for decades the two groups had formed an unusual alliance with a “shared ambition to see Israel conquer its enemies” — for rather different reasons. “The Israelis had practical aims, hoping that American support would preserve their embattled nation,” he said. “The evangelicals, by contrast, prayed that aid would trigger the apocalypse and set the stage for the coming of Christ.” Baptist preacher and Fox News contributor Robert Jeffress recently outlined what he saw as the connections between the current war and biblical descriptions of the end times,NPR reportedearlier this month. “The Bible predicts the final world conflict will happen on the plain of Megiddo in Israel when the superpowers assemble together to do battle,” he told Fox News. “Well, I think we can see now how a regional conflict could quickly escalate into a worldwide conflict. And that is going to happen one day.” Speaking toa gatheringof the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas on Saturday, newly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson said it was “not an accident” that the first resolution he brought to the floor was showing the chamber’s support for Israel, “and my first trip was to come and be with you”. “I assured [Mr Netanyahu] of our unwavering support of Israel and her people and I assured him that our Congress … under my leadership, we will be there until the end of this conflict,”he said. “As a Christian, I know and we believe that the Bible teaches very clearly that we’re to stand with Israel — that God will bless the nation that blesses Israel.” frank.chung@news.com.au To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout The Greens leader has issued a warning to the major political parties as he joins a blockade at a major port to demonstrate for environmental change.

"Sydney mum escapes Gaza, reveals horrors",https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-terror-group-warns-it-will-carry-out-more-attacks-like-those-on-october-7/news-story/9b97ce2928cad14a116afd0ecddbe311,"A mother from Sydney has revealed the horrors from within Gaza after escaping the war zone. The woman known only as Mona was one of 20 Australians to flee via the Rafrah crossing to Egypt, which opened on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Israel has been receiving international condemnation for its two strikes on a refugee camp in Gaza, one of which it says took out a Hamas commander – but dozens of civilians were also reportedly killed. US President Joe Biden has also for a “humanitarian pause” during a campaign rally after a woman interrupted him mid-speech and demanded a ceasefire in Gaza. Sydney mother escapes Gaza A Sydney mother has explained the horrors within Gaza after finally escaping the war zone when the Rafah crossing into Egypt opened on Wednesday. The woman, named Mona, said people hid underground as bombs completely eviscerated the Gaza Strip. She said she was happy she escaped, but was terrified for her brothers and sisters still trapped in the region under siege. “Twenty-five days, people underground, bombing everywhere, there is no water, no food, no sleep, we can’t sleep, even at night. We are suffering,” the woman named Mona said in a video posted to social media by Palestinian photographer Majdi Fathi. “I’m very happy that I’m going to see my family, but I’m leaving all my family, my brothers and sisters, behind. “They’re suffering there, kids crying all night, they’re shaking. The life is terrible there. “You can’t describe, it’s very, very scary, it’s very dangerous all over the place.” Mona was one of 23 Australians who fled Gaza into Egypt after the Rafah border crossing was reopened on Wednesday. The deal to allow foreigners through the gate was put together by Egyptian, Qatari, Israeli, Hamas and American officials. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said while the escape of some Australians was a piece of welcome news, there was still lots to be done to ensure the safety of other civilians trapped in Gaza. “This is really good progress and we are very grateful and relieved this has occurred, but there’s a lot more to be done,” Senator Wong said. “There are still Australians in Gaza. I know how distressing thesituation is for them and for their next of kin. Please be sure, wewill continue to press for all of you to cross the border in Gaza.” 20,000 wounded still trapped in Gaza More than 20,000 wounded people are still trapped in the Gaza Strip, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF), despite initial evacuations of foreign passport holders and badly injured Palestinians across the border to Egypt. The Rafah border crossing was opened yesterday after a build-up of refugees forced international powers to act. MSF noted the evacuations of “a number of severely injured” people in a statement on Wednesday, saying that its 22 international staff members in Gaza had also been among those who left the territory via the Rafah border crossing. “However, there are still over 20,000 injured people in Gaza with limited access to healthcare due to the siege,” it said. MSF’s Palestinian staff were still offering care in the territory and another international team was waiting to enter the territory to replace those who left “as soon as the situation allows”. The organisation went on to call for a greater number of people to be evacuated, as well as for a ceasefire and for more critical aid to be allowed in. “Those who wish to leave Gaza must be allowed to do so without further delay. They must also be allowed the right to return,” the statement said. Israel bombings ‘could amount to war crimes’ The United Nations has heavily criticised Israel’s most recent bombings, joining a chorus of international condemnation on Thursday. The UN’s top human rights body said it had “serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes”. UN chief Antonio Guterres was “appalled” by the “Israeli air strikes in residential areas of the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp”, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. This includes “the killing of Palestinians, including women and children, in Israeli air strikes in residential areas of the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp”, Dujarric added. Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel “to condemn the Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza”, while Bolivia severed diplomatic ties in protest. Israel has rejected the accusations, saying Hamas deliberately uses civilian areas to hide command posts and arsenals that are used to attack Israeli civilians. The Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday’s strike on Jabalia had killed Hamas battalion commander Ibrahim Biari and destroyed an underground tunnel complex. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht described Bihari as a “high-value target” who deployed Hamas commandos during the October 7 attacks and has since “overseen Hamas’ battle efforts in northern Gaza.” “Our war is not with the people of Gaza,” he said. “The Palestinian people deserve peace and safety. Instead they are exploited as shields.” Jews assaulted on street in disturbing footageDisturbing footage shows the moment two male Orthodox Jews are “brutally assaulted” by Israeli police on a street in Jerusalem. According to Palestinian news agency Quds News Network, Israeli police were raiding an anti-Zionist Jewish neighbourhood to remove Palestinian flags on Wednesday when violent scenes erupted. In the video shared on the news agency’s social media, one officer can be seen walking up to a Jewish man in the street before knocking him to the ground. When another man attempts to help he is quickly pounced upon by other officers who drag him away from the man still being held on the ground. As the altercation continues, another man holding a bag is seen being dragged by an officer before he is thrown up against a metal gated door, with such force it bursts opens. Standing in front of the door, the officer continues to attack the man, seemingly striking him in the head while yelling. The officer eventually walks away but when the man later attempts to pass through the door and escape, the officer points at him and pushes him back inside. The footage, which has amassed more than five million views, was reposted by a journalist who said he hadn’t “seen this kind of state violence against Jews since Nazi Germany”. ‘At the gates’: Hamas’ first line of defence at Gaza breached Israel’s military said it has breached Hamas’ first line of defence, stating they were “at the gates” of Gaza City. IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said “with advance planning, precise intelligence and joint attacks [from the land, air and sea], our forces broke through Hamas’ front lines of defence in the north of the Gaza Strip,” according toThe Times of Israel. The IDF’s Brigadier General Itzik Cohen, commander of the 162nd armoured division, further confirmed forces were deep in Gaza. “We are located at the gates of Gaza City,” he told reporters. Brig. Gen. Cohen added over the past five days “we have destroyed much of Hamas’ capabilities, attacked its strategic facilities, all of its array of explosives, its underground tunnels and other facilities we completely destroyed”. However, he said it was a “long task” and there was much work that still remained. The IDF also claimed an air strike has killed the head of Hamas’s anti-tank missile unit in Gaza, Muhammad A’sar. “Under his command, numerous anti-tank missile attacks were carried out against civilians and IDF soldiers,” it claimed in a post on X. 195 people killed in strikes on refugee camp At least 195 people have been killed in two Israeli air strikes on the Jabalya refugee camp on Tuesday and Wednesday, a Hamas-run government media office has confirmed. At least 777 people are wounded while 120 people remain missing following the attack. Dr. Atef Al Kahlout, the director of Gaza’s Indonesian hospital, told CNN the strike on Wednesday, which hit the Falluja neighbourhood of the camp, killed at least 80 people, with women and children making up the majority of casualties. Hamas authorities in Gaza said dead and injured people were being retrieved from the rubble. Israel has relentlessly pounded Gaza in retribution for the worst attack in its history, when Hamas gunmen stormed across the border, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. AFP reporters saw more tanks pour into northern Gaza, as Israel stepped up its ground incursion launched late last week. Its bombing campaign has killed 8,796 people, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Israel said 16 soldiers died in fighting since Tuesday in and near Gaza, bringing to at least 331 the number killed since the October 7 attacks, most of them in Hamas’s initial cross-border rampage. – With NCA Newswire 32 innocent kids hostage in 500km tunnel The desperate parents of 32 child hostages snatched by Hamas pleaded last night for the terror group to release them. The petrified youngsters are being held underground in the 500km network of tunnels dubbed the Gaza Metro as Israel battles to crush the jihadists and bring them home. The Sunhas exclusively published the names and photos of all 32 innocent kids to back the plea of their distraught families: “Please free our children.” Dafna Eyakim, 15, and her sister Ella, eight, were among 32 child hostages — one just nine months old — taken in the bloodthirsty raid on Israel on October 7. Mother Mayaan, 50, laid bare her desperation as a photo emerged of her tearful girls on mattresses in a tunnel under Gaza. It was published on social media channel Telegram by Hamas with the Arabic message: “Dress them in prayer clothes” — a taunt as they are in pyjamas. The divorcee told how the girls had gone to stay with their dad near the Gaza border to celebrate the 17th anniversary of his kibbutz, Nahal Oz. Tragically, the dad, his new partner and her teenage son were all killed, while the two girls were taken to Gaza. Speaking toThe Sun, airport worker Mayaan asked: “Who kidnaps children? Where in the world is that the right thing to do?” “You do not abduct babies and children. My two are wonderful, sweet girls who love TikTok and Snapchat and I want them home.” The oldest of the taken children are five 17-year-olds on the verge of adulthood and the youngest is Kfir Bibas, just nine months and beginning to crawl. He was taken with brother Ariel, four, and mum Shiri, 32, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. A video emerged of terrified Shiri clinging on to her boys surrounded by gunmen. The International Committee of the Red Cross said families are “worried sick.” “The ICRC has made repeated requests to visit the hostages so we can check on their well-being,” it said. A total of 240 hostages were taken in the Hamas rampage. Four have been freed and a woman soldier was rescued. US hostage expert Danielle Gilbert said taking kids is rare. She toldThe Sun: “Holding on to someone vulnerable and not predisposed to surviving in those conditions will make the kidnappers’ job more difficult. “It remains to be seen whether Hamas intended to take this wide a range.” – With The Sun ‘Shame:’ US university student mobbed by pro-Palestinian supporters Troubling video footage shows a Harvard University student getting aggressively mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators on the Ivy League campus screaming, “Shame, shame, shame.” More than a half-dozen demonstrators are seen holding keffiyehs — traditional Palestinian scarves — in the student’s face as they surround him and stop him from getting away, a video posted on X shows. The disturbing footage was posted Wednesday but is from an October 18 “stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration by the Harvard Business School, according to school officials and media reports. Scores of students participated in the radical demonstration held 11 days after Hamas terrorists launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7. According to theHarvard Crimson, the school’s student newspaper, the confrontation at the demonstration was sparked when the accosted student “began to film demonstrators’ faces.” “Within minutes, he was escorted out by protest organisers, who blocked his camera with their keffiyehs — traditional scarves worn by Palestinians that have come to symbolise Palestinian nationalism,” the newspaper wrote. “Demonstrators yelled ‘shame’ at the disrupter as he left.” Harvard Business School Dean Srikant Datar later addressed the “troubling confrontation” that he said “left many of our students shaken.” “Reports have been filed with [the Harvard University Police Department] and the FBI, the facts are being evaluated, and it will be some time before we learn the results of an investigation,” Datar wrote. – With the New York Post Israel releases map of ‘refugee camp’ The Israel Defense Forces has released a map claiming to show a “terrorist stronghold” in Jabalia, where a Hamas commander and dozens of people were killed at a refugee camp following an Israeli air strike on Tuesday. Palestinian health officials said at least 50 Palestinians were killed and 150 wounded in the blast, however, the IDF has claimed the estimated 50 deaths comprised of terrorists and not civilians. The Israel military said its fighter jets “assassinated Ibrahim Biari, commander of the Jabalia brigade of the Hamas terrorist organisation, who was one of those who directed the murderous terrorist attack on October 7”. It added that “Hamas’s underground military infrastructure beneath these buildings collapsed,” in the strike and “many Hamas terrorists” were killed. The IDF have since released a detailed map of Jabalia, which they claim shows the location of a weapons facility, battalion command centre, tunnels and rocket launching posts. “The stronghold was used for training and execution of terrorism activities,” it said in a post on X. “During the ground activity, the troops eliminated approx. 50 terrorists, as well as destroyed entrances to terrorist tunnels and weapons.” IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari earlier did not directly address reports of civilian casualties at a briefing. Instead, he said, “The Hamas terrorists continue to use civilian population as protective armour. This is intentional and devastatingly barbaric.” A Hamas spokesperson, who was quoted by Al Arabiya TV, has denied the senior commander was at the camp, and accused the IDF of attempting to justify “its heinous crime”. Hamas also claimed seven hostages from its October 7 attacks, including three foreign passport holders, were killed in the bombing. Earlier, a senior military commandeer conceded IDF knew there were countless innocent men, women and children in the refugee camp but decided to bomb it anyway. The stark admission came amid growing condemnation of the air strike on the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza’s north. In an appearance on CNN with acclaimed broadcaster Wolf Blitzer, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht was asked plainly if he could confirm whether Israel knew a large number of civilians, including children were in the camp. “I can,” he replied. Seemingly taken back, Blitzer repeatedly pressed Lieutenant Colonel Hecht on why the IDF launched air strikes when it knew civilians would be killed. “Even if that Hamas commander was there, amidst all of those Palestinian refugees, Israel still went ahead and dropped a bomb, knowing a lot of innocent men, women and children would be killed?” Blitzer asked. “We were focused on this commander … who killed many, many Israelis,” Lieutenant Colonel Hecht replied. “This is a very complicated battle space.” Blitzer continued to ask why Israel seemed to disregard the high civilian cost of its attack. “This is the tragedy of war,” he replied. International aid organisation Médecins Sans Frontières – Doctors Without Borders – meanwhile said it was “horrified” by the attack, which saw scores of wounded civilians flood the nearby Dar al-Shifa hospital. Mr Hawajreh said: “Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families. Many were screaming and asking for their parents.” 20 Australians escape Gaza The assistant minister for foreign affairs, Tim Watts, has announced 20 Australians who were registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have escaped Gaza and crossed the border at Rafah to Egypt. An additional three people who were also registered with the government also crossed. More than 335 foreign passport holders were granted permission to leave Gaza for the first time since the Israel-Hamas conflict began on October 7. The Rafah crossing is currently the only way out of Gaza. It had earlier been reported that 112 Australians had left Gaza, according to numbers fromCNNvia an Egyptian official. “They were met by Australian consular officials who are on the ground in Egypt who were able to provide assistance with ongoing travel arrangements,” Mr Watts told ABC News. “We‘re grateful that this initial cohort has made the crossing from Gaza to Egypt.” Sixty-five Australians remain stuck in Gaza and are being provided with consular assistance. “We are continuing to push for them to be able to make that passage across the Rafah crossing as soon as possible,” he said. Almost 500 foreigners were expected at the crossing today but the remainder either didn’t make it or refused to cross into Egypt without family members. A number of injured Palestinians were also able to leave Gaza. ‘Cries of young children’: Chilling Hamas video A Hamas terrorist has admitted to shooting up a safe room after hearing the “cries of young children” inside, in a chilling video shared by the Israel Defense Forces. In the video, an integrator questions the terrorist, who has been identified as Amer Abu Ghosha, a member of the Nukhba, the commando unit of Hamas, about an October 7 attack in Kfar Aza,The Times of Israelreports. “We entered a house that was near us, we entered through the window,” he tells the integrator in the video.“We checked the house and heard the sounds of young children in the safe room … We shot at the safe room.” The man went on to explain himself and others militants initially walked past the room on the way to eat dates and drink water. “After, we heard sounds of young children,” he said, adding they continued to shoot at the door “until we didn’t hear noise anymore”. He said the IDF later arrived at the house and engaged in an armed confrontation with the militants until they surrendered and turned themselves in. When asked what the difference is between Hamas and ISIS, the man says he was shown videos by an interrogator that are “worse than ISIS”. “There is no difference.” ‘There will be more’ attacks, Hamas warns Hamas official Ghazi Hamad has made some disturbing remarks on television, reaffirming the terrorist group’s commitment to destroy Israel and saying there will be more attacks like the one on October 7. “Israel is a country that has no place on our land. We must remove that country, because it constitutes a security, military and political catastrophe to the Arab and Islamic nation, and must be finished,” Hamad said on LBC International. “We are not ashamed to say this, with full force. We must teach Israel a lesson, and we will do this again and again. “The Al-Aqsa Flood (Hamas’s name for the attack on October 7) is just the first time. And there will be a second, a third, a fourth. Because we have the determination, the resolve, the capabilities to fight. “Will we have to pay a price? Yes, and we are ready to pay it.” Hamad repeated his previous claim that Hamas “did not want to harm civilians” but “there were complications on the ground”. (A reminder, here, that Hamas militants killed over a thousand Israeli civilians, in often horrific ways, and abducted hundreds more.) “The occupation must end,” he said. “In the Gaza Strip?” the LBC interviewer asked. “In all the Palestinian lands,” he replied. “Does that mean the annihilation of Israel?” she followed up. “Yes, of course,” said Hamad. “The existence of Israel is what causes all that pain, blood and tears. It is Israel, not us. We are the victims of the occupation. Period. Therefore, nobody should blame us for the things we do … everything we do is justified.” Refugee camp hit for a second time The Jabalia suburb of northern Gaza, which on Wednesday was hit by air strikes killing around 50 people, has been hit again. On Thursday afternoon, local time, a new blast occurred in the densely packed area. It has coincided with a ground operation by Israeli troops which has seen around 15 soldiers die. Hamas authorities in Gaza said dead and injured people were being retrieved from the rubble. The Israel Defence Forces said the strike on Wednesday in Jabalia killed a number of senior Hamas commanders and destroyed a command centre and part of Hamas’ notorious tunnel network. Countries around the world have condemned the Jabalia attack which killed civilians. Hamas has claimed seven hostages also died in the attack, including foreigners. Israel has accused Hamas of using civilians has human shields around its military infrastructure. Nation withdraws ambassador from Israel Jordan, a country bordering Israel which has been on relatively friendly terms with Tel Aviv, has withdrawn its ambassador. Relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours is being tested by the conflict. Jordan’s foreign minister Ayman Safadi said the move was “an expression of Jordan’s position rejecting and condemning the Israeli war raging in Gaza”. The ambassador would only return once the Gaza conflict was over. Amman also said that Israel’s ambassador to Jordan, who is not in Jordan right now, was not welcome to return. Shani Lock’s brother ‘relieved’ that she’s dead Yesterday it was confirmed that Shani Louk, the 22-year-old German-Israeli tattoo artist who was among those abducted by Hamas, had been found dead, with DNA tests proving a skull fragment belonged to her. The rest of her body has not been located. Speaking to Britain’s Sky News today, her brother Atim described his heartbreak – and relief. “In so many ways, I feel (relieved) to know this, that she’s not suffering anymore,” Mr Louk said. He said his sister had “no dark side” and was “a pure angel”. Both Atim and the siblings’ father, Nissim, have pushed back on the claim from Israeli President Isaac Herzog that Shani was beheaded. They believe she was shot in the head. “Until about 6.45pm (on the day of the attack), Shani was still dancing, cheering, and going wild at the party and was surrounded by all her best friends Nissim Louk told the Israeli news outlet N12. “She was killed on the spot and not only did she not suffer. Ten minutes earlier she was still enjoying herself.” ‘She was still breathing’: Young girl’s horrific fate An Israeli medic, Linor Attias, has spoken to CNN and described more horrifying details from the aftermath of Hamas’s attack on October 7, including the grisly fate of family of four. “I remember that I turned my head and I saw the family. They’d tied up the kids. And the parents were tied up in front of their kids, and they shot them,” Ms Attias said. “There was so much blood. And I didn’t have the time to feel anything at that moment.” She said the two children included a girl “around 11” years old, the same age as her own daughter, and a boy who was about six. “Honestly in that moment, I just blocked all feeling. I understood that in that moment, I was a soldier, a robotic soldier, if I wanted to survive that and help as many people as we could.” Breaking down in tears, Ms Attias also described the moment she found a girl who was “eight or nine years old”. “They had cut her hand, here,” she said, pointing to her elbow. “They cut it all. No hand. She was still breathing. She was shaking. And I performed a tourniquet, but it was her last breaths. I wasn’t there earlier to save her. She had just lost so much blood, for hours, all by herself. No one was near her. She was so afraid. Her eyes. All by herself. “I don’t know how to explain that. What kind of evil can create that kind of operation? Because they thought about everything. I was well organised. And the world needs to know.” An excerpt from the interview is below – it’s a tough watch. Hamas says seven hostages killed in Gaza camp bombing Hamas has claimed seven hostages from its October 7 attacks, including three foreign passport holders, were killed in Israel’s bombing of Gaza’s largest refugee camp. Dozens of bodies were seen on Tuesday at the Jabalia camp where Israel said it killed a Hamas military commander in a strike on a tunnel complex. “Seven detainees were killed in the Jabalia massacre yesterday, including three holders of foreign passports,” said a Hamas military wing statement. No details were given and it was not possible to independently verify the claim. Israel says that 240 hostages were taken when Hamas fighters crossed the border to stage raids in which they killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Israel’s raid on the Jabalia camp was one of thousands since the attacks which the Hamas health ministry says have killed more than 8,500 people, two-thirds of them women and children. The Israel military said its fighter jets “assassinated Ibrahim Biari, commander of the Jabalia brigade of the Hamas terrorist organisation, who was one of those who directed the murderous terrorist attack on October 7”. It added that “Hamas’s underground military infrastructure beneath these buildings collapsed,” in the strike and “many Hamas terrorists” were killed. Hundreds gather at border crossing Hundreds of wounded Gaza residents and foreigners have gathered at the Egypt border to flee the shattered territory. Livefootage of the Rafah border crossing showed the first people crossing over at 7pm (AEDT). Images showed long lines of ambulances and several people in wheelchairs at the Rafah border crossing – the only one not controlled by Israel – after Egypt said it would let in 81 of the most seriously injured. Egypt also announced the first foreigners could exit Gaza, which has suffered weeks of relentless bombardment by Israel that has cost the lives of more than 8,500 people, including more than 3,500 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It comes as Israel continues to send tanks over the border into northern Gaza as the IDF steps up its ground incursion. Gaza in total communications blackout Gaza‘s largest telecommunications provider, Paltel, has announced that internet and phone networks are down, cutting civilians off from communicating with family members outside the Strip. “Dear people in our beloved homeland, We regret to announce a complete interruption of all communications and internet services with the Gaza Strip, due to international routes that were previously reconnected being cut off again,” Paltel said in a social media post. “May God protect you and protect our country.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",

The Israeli Defence Forces says those killed were terrorists, including a senior Hamas leader, while health officials on the ground claim most were civilians – many of them children. The IDF has also deployed a sophisticated ‘missile-killer’ weapon for the first time after Iran-backed militants in Yemen attempted a rocket attack. Meanwhile, the father of a young woman whose remains were found at the site of the 7 October massacre at a music festival has spoken of his heartache. And elsewhere, the United States has expressed concern at escalating attacks on its troops throughout the Middle East. Follow along for the latest live updates. ‘There will be more’ attacks, Hamas warns Hamas official Ghazi Hamad has made some disturbing remarks on television, reaffirming the terrorist group’s commitment to destroy Israel and saying there will be more attacks like the one on October 7. “Israel is a country that has no place on our land.

Known as the Arrow 3, the long-range air defence system is capable of intercepting and destroying ballistic missiles from thousands of kilometres away. Believed to be the world’s first system of its kind, the powerful device fires a warhead that completely obliterates its target, dramatically reducing the potential debris. It has a range of 2400km and cost about US$2 billion (AU$3.2 billion) to develop. And yesterday, the IDF activated it for the first time. A “surface-to-surface missile” was fired towards Israel from Yemen and it was “successfully intercepted” by the Arrow 3. The IDF believes the missile was targeting the city of Eilat in the country’s south. ‘We knew’: Israel’s staggering refugee admission A senior military commander has conceded the Israeli Defence Forces knew there were countless innocent men, women and children in a refugee camp it was targeting, but dropped bombs anyway. The stark admission comes amid growing international condemnation of the air strike on the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza’s north – the region’s largest – has killed dozens of people, including children. Following the attack, which comprised at least six missiles, the IDF claimed those killed were Hamas terrorists, including a senior figure who helped mastermind the 7 October massacres in Israel. But an interview with a high-ranking Israeli military figure undermines that assertion. In an appearance on CNN with acclaimed broadcaster Wolf Blitzer, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht was asked plainly if he could confirm whether Israel knew a large number of civilians, including children were in the camp. “I can,” he replied. Seemingly taken back, Blitzer repeatedly pressed Lieutenant Colonel Hecht on why the IDF launched air strikes when it knew civilians would be killed. “Even if that Hamas commander was there, amidst all of those Palestinian refugees, Israel still went ahead and dropped a bomb, knowing a lot of innocent men, women and children would be killed?” Blitzer asked. “We were focused on this commander … who killed many, many Israelis,” Lieutenant Colonel Hecht replied. “This is a very complicated battle space.” Blitzer continued to ask why Israel seemed to disregard the high civilian cost of its attack. “This is the tragedy of war,” he replied. World reacts with fury to refugee camp horrors Warning: Graphic content Israel’s bombing of a massive refugee camp in Gaza, which has killed dozens of people, including children, has sparked international fury. Video, images and eyewitness accounts emerging from the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, which is the region’s largest, cast serious doubt on the Israeli Defence Forces claims that the estimated 50 deaths comprised terrorists and not civilians. Vision shared by members of the media on the ground, too graphic to publish, shows horrifying scenes, including the bodies of babies and toddlers being found, some with missing limbs. In one clip seen by news.com.au, a young girl is pulled from the rubble, coated in blood and dust, with a screaming family member watching on in the background. In another, a boy covers the partial remains of a toddler in a blanket. Elsewhere in the chaos, a deceased elderly women is carefully carried in a stretcher over chunks of concrete. A number of videos also show child survivors being rescued, including a young boy and a girl who appears to be in her early teens. The Israeli Defence Forces has justified the attack, saying it was targeting Hamas terrorists and killed a senior leader of the militant group who was hiding in the camp. British broadcaster Piers Morgan took to X, formerly Twitter, to express horror at the attack. “Israel deliberately bombing Gaza’s largest refugee camp, even if a Hamas commander was there, is outrageous and indefensible,” Morgan wrote. Non-profit group Medical Aid for Palestinians called the refugee camp attack “a new low” in the Israel-Hamas conflict, with Melanie Ward, chief executive, saying it “should serve as a wake-up call to world leaders and politicians everywhere”. “Their meek requests for compliance with international law are being ignored entirely; Israel has instead increased the ferocity of its indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks,” Ms Ward said in a statement. Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry said there are potentially “dozens” of people trapped beneath the rubble after “a heinous Israeli massacre that targeted a large area of homes”. The medical director of a nearby hospital repeated the claim toThe New York Times, saying numerous civilians were dead. And a local doctor told ABC News 24 that “the number actually could be in the hundreds”. International aid organisation Médecins Sans Frontières – Doctors Without Borders – said it was “horrified” by the situation. Scores of wounded civilians have flooded the nearby Dar al-Shifa hospital, MSF nurse Mohammed Hawajreh said in a statement. Mr Hawajreh said: “Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families. Many were screaming and asking for their parents. “I stayed with them until we could find a place, as the hospital was full with patients.” In a message on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, MSF condemned the “senseless violence” and repeated calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. “Enough is enough!” it wrote. Photos from the scene show the devastating aftermath of at least six air strikes, with whole neighbourhoods decimated and large craters filled with debris, as well as rows of body bags lining the streets. Rescue workers are desperately combing through the rubble of multiple severely damaged buildings. Local man Mohammad Al Aswad was 100m from the camp when “huge missiles” began raining down, he told CNN. “I ran like crazy to the area. I found my family all safe, but the scene was horrific. “Children were carrying other injured children and running, with grey dust filling the air. Bodies were hanging on the rubble, many of them unrecognised. Some were bleeding and others were burnt.” Mr Al Aswad estimated some 40 buildings had been “completely demolished”. “I saw women screaming and confused. They didn’t know whether to cry for losing their children or run and look for them, especially since many children were playing in the neighbourhood.” At a press conference, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said “about 50 terrorists were eliminated”. Palestinian authorities strongly disputes that claim, as do local doctors, aid groups and witnesses. The IDF said it conducted a “wide-scale strike on terrorists and terror infrastructure”. “IDF forces under the command of the Givati Brigade took over a Hamas military stronghold in West Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, in-ground operations today,” a statement read. Senior Hamas figure Ibrahim Biari, commander of the terror group’s Central Jabalia Battalion, was killed in the blast. Jordan condemned the air strike, with the country’s Foreign Ministry describing it was as a contradiction of “all human and moral values and the rules of international humanitarian law”. Egypt also slammed “in the strongest terms” what it called Israel’s “targeting” of a residential area. “Egypt considered this as a new flagrant violation by the Israeli forces against the provisions of international law and international humanitarian law,” its Foreign Ministry said. Saudi Arabia said the “dangerous humanitarian conditions” in Gaza as a result of the ongoing conflict “cannot be justified at all”. “Sparing blood, protecting civilians, and stopping military operations are urgent priorities for which any procrastination or disruption cannot be accepted, and failure to immediately adhere to them will inevitably lead to a humanitarian catastrophe for which the Israeli occupation and the international community bear responsibility,” the Saudi Foreign Minister’s office said in a statement. Rear Admiral Hagari insisted those killed were “terrorists who were with him inside the building as well as under the building in tunnels.” “The targeting of the building he was in led to destruction in other buildings because of this extensive underground infrastructure. The purpose of that infrastructure was to carry out attacks against Israel and that infrastructure has collapsed.” Referencing the number of civilian homes in the dense area, Rear Admiral Hagari said the buildings targeted were used as a Hamas command centre both above and below ground. Terrorists had “intentionally built Hamas infrastructure beneath people’s homes” and the group was using civilians as shields. He urged civilians in the area to move south away from the combat zone, with ground operations set to intensify. Protesters storm Defence Minister’s office Pro-Palestine protestersstormed the electorate office of Defence Minister Richard Marlesin Geelong in Victoria, sparking a police operation. A number of demonstrators chained themselves by their necks in the reception area using bike locks and refused to leave. Others blocked the entrance to the building, located in Geelong in Victoria, and erected banners reading “Stop the genocide” and “Disarm Israel”. The lock-in lasted almost four hours before police moved in and forcibly removed protesters. The building was cleared by 2.20pm. Multiple countries severe diplomatic ties A number of countries have severed diplomatic relations with Israel in the wake of the bombing of a massive refugee camp in Gaza. Chile has recalled its envoy to Israel over what President Gabriel Boric called “unacceptable” violations of international law. Colombia has also removed its ambassador, with President Gustavo Petro writing on X: “If Israel does not stop the massacre of the Palestinian people we cannot be there.” Bolivia has cut ties with Israel over what it said are “crimes against humanity”. Protesters lock down London station Several hundred pro-Palestine protesters have stormed a major London railway station to stage a sit-in that during the evening rush hour commute. Video and images circulating online show a massive crowd occupying the central concourse at Liverpool Station, chanting slogans and waving signs. The demonstration came amid horrifying reports of an Israeli air strike on a massive refugee camp in Gaza’s north, which has killed dozens, including women and children. Feminist group Sisters Uncut organised the protest and said at least 500 people attended and wrote on its X profile: “No business as usual until genocide ends. Ceasefire now.” Among the protesters were several people holding “Jews against genocide” placards. In a statement, British Transport Police said officers were called to Liverpool Station shortly after 5pm when the crowd began arriving. “Officers worked to safely disperse the crowd and ensure passengers could access the station. Following the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza, British Transport Police will be conducting high-visibility patrols at stations across the network to reassure and protect communities.” The sit-in sparked a mix of responses online, with conservative political commentator Tim Scott saying that “police have lost control of London”. Politician Paul Golding, leader of the Britain First party, wrote on X: “If you love Gaza so much, may I politely suggest you piss off there.” Meanwhile, journalist David Atherton shared vision of a pro-Palestine protester defacing posters throughout the station showing missing Israelis held captive in Gaza by Hamas. The man was captured scribbling “fake news” over a number of the signs. Egypt ‘prepared to sacrifice millions’ In sensational remarks, Egypt’s prime minister has vowed he’ll “sacrifice millions of lives” to protect the country’s sovereignty amid growing calls to accept Palestinian refugees. Mostafa Madbouly addressed a gathering in Sinai of Egyptian military leaders, members of parliament and local tribal leaders. The meeting came a day after a top secret Israel intelligence report was leaked, outlining a draft strategy to relocate millions of people from Gaza to refugee tent cities in Sinai. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu played down the significance of the document, saying it was a “concept” prepared by policy advisers and not an official plan. But today, Mr Madbouly made a stark declaration of the lengths Egypt will go to in order to protect its land. “We are prepared to sacrifice millions of lives to ensure that no one encroaches upon our territory.” Egypt would not allow “any imposed situation” or the forced settlement of regional issues at its expense, he added. Hamas preparing chemical weapons: IDF Israel has recovered what it describes as a Hamas manual for making chemical weapons – alongside a list of suggested sites, from schools to move theatres. The New York Post obtained a copy of the seven-page document and cited unnamed sources from within the Israeli Defence Forces. A memory record from a GoPro camera, found on the body of a Hamas terrorist killed on 7 October following a massacre at Kibbutz Be'eri. “One package is easy and cheap to prepare for any desired amount of cargo, whether it is a box — or more — carried by hand, or a container that is dropped from a flying plane,” an English translation reads, according to the newspaper. Extremely detailed instructions about the preparation of weapons, including how to detonate them, are provided. The worst in Gaza is yet to come An expert on Middle East affairs has warned the worst of the conflict in Gaza is yet to come, as Israel steps up its ground offensive against Hamas. The bombing of a massive refugee camp today, which has killed dozens of people, “is going to be one of many similar incidents” in the months ahead, Atlantic Council nonresident senior fellow Carmiel Arbit told ABC News 24. “We will continue to see significant casualties across [and] the images that we are seeing on the screen are going to become increasingly difficult, but are unlikely to change Israel’s objective as it pursues this war,” Ms Arbit said. Israel faces a difficult position given Hamas notoriously uses citizens and civilian infrastructure to disguise or shield its military operations, she said. “Hamas both uses human shields and sets up command operations in major civilian centres. It has built what is often called the Gaza Metro, [a tunnel system] which runs underneath the totality of Gaza and is half the size of the New York subway. “And so, as Israel tries to specifically navigate taking out Hamas targets, it also has a responsibility to be responsive to civilians and international military law – but the two are often directly in conflict. Ms Arbit said she expects the Israel-Hamas conflict to drag on for several months “if not many more”. Hamas leader taken out The Israeli Defence Forces has confirmed a senior Hamas figure was killed in the air strike on a Gaza refugee camp. Ibrahim Biari was one of the masterminds of the co-ordinated massacres on Israelis on 7 October in the country’s south, and said to also be responsible for a 2004 attack on Ashdod Port. Biari was the commander of the Hamas Central Jabaliya Battalion. “The strike damaged Hamas’ command and control in the area, as well as its ability to direct military activity against IDF soldiers operating throughout the Gaza Strip,” the IDF said in a statement. US forces under siege The Pentagon has revealed American military personnel stationed across the Middle East have been subjected to least 27 attacks in the past two weeks. “In some cases, they just didn’t strike anything,” Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told reporters. “To my knowledge [there were] no injuries, no damaged infrastructure.” The US blames “Iran-backed terror groups” for the attacks, which came in the form of rocket and drone strikes – 16 in Iraq and 11 in Syria. Father of murdered tattoo artist speaks The father of Shani Louk, the 23-year-old tattoo artist killed by Hamas militants at a music festival in Israel, has spoken about his daughter’s death. It was thought Ms Louk had been taken hostage during a series of devastating massacres on 7 October, which killed 1400 and led to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Imagery appeared soon after the festival massacre showing Ms Louk in the back of a flatbed truck being paraded through Gaza. However, hopes Ms Louk might still be alive were tragically dashed yesterday when it was confirmed a skull fragment found at the festival site was hers. “Until about 6.45am, Shani was still dancing, cheering, and going wild at the party and was surrounded by all her best friends — and they had fun all night,” her father Nissim Louk told Israeli news outletN12. “She enjoyed herself until the last moment. “She was killed on the spot and not only did she not suffer, 10 minutes earlier she was still enjoying herself.” Ms Louk added that there was “some comfort” in knowing that his daughter wasn’t “tossed in some Gaza tunnel”. “Shani was a beautiful girl who loved to dance. Everyone loved her. She was very smart and witty. That’s how I want her to be remembered.” Mr Louk said the Hamas attack was a failure of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. “The government ministries all failed. They underestimated everyone, they don’t work, they don’t answer, they’re not normal. “If the prime minister were to show up at my house, I’d tell him to leave, since he bears much responsibility for what happened”. Two IDF soldiers killed The Israeli Defence Forces has confirmed two young soldiers were killed in a battle with Hamas militants in northern Gaza. Roei Wolf and Lavi Lipshitz, both 20, died after being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. The news came as the IDF said more than 300 Israeli troops have been killed since the conflict with Hamas kicked off in early October. IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said: “Our soldiers at this time are fighting on the battlefield with courage and valour.” “This fighting is dangerous and you have to understand that there are costs. We all need resilience and courage.” More US troops heading to Middle East The United States will send an additional 300 troops to the Middle East, the Pentagon has announced. That contingent joins military forces already deployed throughout the region and will provide “capabilities and explosive ordinance disposal communications”. Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Patrick Ryder did not say where in the Middle East the troops will be sent, but specified they would not be on the ground in Israel. “They are intended to support regional deterrence efforts and further bolster us force protection capabilities.” Hamas attacks globally are possible The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US has warned of an “elevated” risk of terrorist attacks on American soil by Hamas and its allies. Speaking to the US Senate overnight, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict could serve as “inspiration” for terror outside the region. “We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration, the likes of which we haven’t seen since ISIS launched its so-called ‘caliphate’ several years ago,” Mr Wray said. While the risk of terrorism in the US has been “elevated” throughout the year, he said the war in Gaza “has raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United to a whole other level”. Mr Wray said “this is not a time for panic” and Americans should continue going about their “daily lives – going to schools, houses of worship and so forth”. “But we should remain vigilant,” he said. Hope for hostage releases Hamas claims it will release some of the hundreds of hostages it’s holding captive throughout Gaza – but with a catch. A spokesman for the terror group said negotiations with several countries had led it to a position where some prisoners who hold foreign passports will soon be freed. Actions of Israeli ‘settlers’ slammed An alarming “upsurge of settler terrorism in the West Bank” has resulted in numerous civilian casualties and Palestinians being “forced out of their homes”, the European Union has said. A spokesman for the EU’s Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell criticised the actions of Jews who reside in the disputed territory, known as “settlers”. “The situation could get out of control and is causing unspeakable suffering to local communities,” the spokesman said. “Urgent measures are needed.” Attacks on Palestinians by “extremist settlers”, including the firebombing of homes, only adds “to an already tragic situation in Gaza”. Mr Borrell’s spokesman called for Israel to honour its “duty to protect civilians in the West Bank [and] to hold perpetrators accountable”. The EU believes 1000 people have been forcibly displaced from their homes in the West Bank by settlers. Hospital workers collapsing under ‘physical and psychological stress’ Healthcare workers at Al Quds Hospital in Gaza have claimed “the whole building was shaking” overnight during another Israel’s continued assault on the city. According to Marwan Jilani, director general of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, staff “didn‘t know whether they were going to hit the hospital”. Two nearby buildings, an emergency medical centre and main warehouse, were “severely damaged and are now out of service”. Workers are now “collapsing due to the … physical and psychological stress” as they reportedly continue to await aid from humanitarian groups. “Imagine the stress on the people staying there, taking care of the patients, sheltering there – it is just immense,” Jilani told the BBC. Israel launches controversial online campaign Israel has launched a hard-hitting online campaign featuring shocking images and testimonies from the attacks carried out by Hamas on October 7. Dozens of clips of burnt bodies, bereaved families, fast-cuts of screams and sirens, rescue workers and pathologists are featured on the Israeli foreign ministry’s official social media channels and in paid advertising campaigns. Some of the videos are graphic: in one clip, a pathologist describes photos of a child’s burnt body. But experts say the campaign risks alienating some audiences. There has already been some pushback, with Google limiting access to one graphic clip and a gaming firm demanding the ads be removed. “Subjecting people to images that are literally unbearable is a risky strategy,” communications expert Arnaud Mercier said via AFP. “It could be counter-productive with an audience who didn’t ask to be exposed to it.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Protesters chain themselves to MP’s office,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/protesters-chain-themselves-outside-of-defence-minister-richard-marles-office-over-israelgaza-war/news-story/d04a4b5d840168ec3bdac7825f61ade7,"Protesters have stormed Defence Minister Richard Marles’ office, chaining themselves to ladders and chanting to “end the genocide” in Gaza. A large group of activists, who have described themselves as members of the anti-Zionist Jewish community, entered Mr Marles’ Geelong office earlier on Wednesday and chained themselves by their necks using bike locks in the reception area. Other protesters gathered outside in the lobby area of the building and spread large painted banners on the floor which read “Free Palestine” and “ALP supports ethnic cleansing.” Police responded to the scene after 10am and were seen gathered around the crowd to monitor the situation. One of the protesters who attended the stage-in wrote in a statement published on social media that it was her “ancestral duty to fight for justice.” “As a descendant of Holocaust survivors, I refuse to let Israel’s far-right government weaponise our grief, pain and fear for the purpose of war crimes, invasion and genocide,” Jewish writer and artist Noemie Huttner-Koros said. Another demonstrator, Zelda Grimshaw, said taxpayer funds should not be “funnelled into the pockets of giant weapons corporations.” “The ALP’s Richard Marles acts as a broker for major international weapons deals [ …]. “Australian-made weapons should not be trained on the people of Gaza,” Ms Grimshaw said in an Instagram post. Five people were arrested and were released pending summons in relation to trespassing. The defence minister is currently in Washington DC as part of a two-day visit to the United States. He met with the US secretary of defence earlier on Wednesday to discuss the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal and oversee Australia’s procurement of Black Hawk helicopters. In a statement, Mr Marles said his “first concern is for the safety and wellbeing of my staff”. “The abuse and destruction of property or goods is not acceptable,” he said. Meanwhile, Anthony Albanese has spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time since the October 7 attack. The Prime Minister’s office confirmed the call took place on Wednesday morning and followed his conversation with the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, last week. Speaking to reporters in Sydney, Mr Albanese reiterated Israel had a right to defend itself but stressed how it defended itself mattered. “We remain very concerned about humanitarian issues in Gaza. We continue to urge for all civilians to be protected, for the international rule of law to be applied,” he said. “We say that Israel has a right to defend itself, but how it defends itself matters and we want to see all innocent lives protected. Every life matters. Every Israeli, every Palestinian.” Mr Albanese’s office requested a call with Mr Netanyahu soon after the attack. It comes as Egypt is reportedly set to allow 400 foreigners to leave Gaza through its border, known as the Rafah crossing, which has been closed since the conflict between Hamas and Israel began. Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong told Sky News she did not have any confirmation if any of the 88 Australians trapped in Gaza would be included. She spoke with her Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry, two nights ago. “I again pressed the same view, the same request that Australia has, at my level and at official level, engaged in every day since this conflict began, which is: we want to see our Australians out of Gaza,” she said. “We do call upon all parties to ensure safe passage for our nationals and other civilians.”﻿ To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout A landmark green energy scheme to keep the lights on as ageing coal fired power generation exits the grid has been unveiled, but the government reveal how much the scheme will cost.

Map reveals Israel’s terrifying next move,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-claim-hamas-headquarters-is-hidden-under-the-shifa-hospital-in-gaza/news-story/2ea98d65ba689947ffb368a5f2526dd7,"ANALYSIS Israel insists Hamas militants are operating a command bunker beneath the Gaza Strip’s biggest and most important hospital. Can it prove it? And if it can, does that make the hospital a legitimate target? Truth is the first casualty of war. This is why such an extraordinary claim requires an extraordinary piece of evidence. On Saturday, Israel Defence Force (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari asserted that the Hamas militant wing had dug several underground facilities beneath Shifa Hospital. “Right now, terrorists move freely in Shifa Hospital and other hospitals in Gaza,” Hagari told international media. Israel appears to be preparing the groundwork for a deliberate attack on the 1500-bed facility, releasing a detailed CGI animation and several maps outlining where it claims the Hamas facilities are buried. “There are several underground complexes used by the leaders of the terrorist organisation Hamas to direct their activities,” a statement reads, adding that tunnels from both inside and outside the hospital lead to this Hamas “headquarters”. It claims the facility is used to coordinate rocket fire aimed at Israel, as well as the deployment of Hamas fighters. And that makes it a high-value target. But the only evidence presented publicly so far is a single alleged intercepted phone call. Israel claims it has sent proof from a wide range of intelligence sources to its allies. “The information on the use of Hamas in the hospital is based on an extensive range of well-informed sources of Shin Bet,” the IDF states. “All the information, most of which was not revealed here, was transferred to our intelligence partners worldwide.” Meanwhile, several airstrikes have reportedly targeted the hospital’s immediate surroundings over the weekend. No reports of casualties were available at the time of publication. Tracing Hamas’ tunnels There are several ways Israeli intelligence can infer the presence of bunkers under Shifa Hospital. Drones and surveillance aircraft can track suspects as they move across the Gaza Strip. The points at which they appear and disappear are carefully catalogued and mapped. This tracking can be visual, thermal or by radar. Air or satellite-based thermal sensors could detect the inevitable change in surrounding soil temperatures created by an underground cavity. But this is not direct proof. While these sensors can detect minute changes, they cannot suggest a cause. Israeli reconnaissance aircraft and satellites are known to carry synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This can detect tiny changes in the Earth’s surface, but not why. At best, these technologies point to areas of interest. It would take ground-penetrating radar and electromagnetic sensors to be deployed at the site to determine the cause. Other means include the interrogation of captives, tip-offs by spies – and phone intercepts. It’s not just a matter of listening in on a conversation. Espionage agencies can exploit a mass of data captured and stored by a mobile phone itself. Most modern phones carry accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers along with capacitive, proximity and light sensors. This mass of data can be tapped. When combined and assessed, it can reveal the movements of a carrier in granular detail – such as going up or down a flight of stairs. Israel-based company NSO Group is behind the highly controversial Pegasus surveillance software, which has been used by governments and corporations around the world to spy on the activities of journalists, opposition figures and activists. The wife of murdered US journalist Jamal Khashoggi is seeking to sue NSO after its software was found on her phone. Human shields or collateral damage? Thousands of Palestinian civilians are seeking refuge, shelter, food and power inside the Shifa Hospital’s compound after weeks of intense Israeli bombardment. Most of the Gaza Strip’s power generation facilities are offline following Israel’s blockade of fuel supplies. And the trickle of food and supplies crossing the Egyptian border falls far short of that needed to sustain the region’s two million people. But Admiral Hagari insisted Israel has “concrete evidence” that “hundreds” of terrorists had joined the crowds to “hide” inside the hospital grounds. Does that make the hospital a legitimate target? “The IDF, the Israeli government, should be taking every possible means available to them to distinguish between Hamas – terrorists, who are legitimate military targets – and civilians, who are not,” US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said at the weekend. The Shifa Hospital is the largest in the Gaza Strip. And coming just a week after an explosion killed hundreds at the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, the new IDF allegation has evoked an international response. The source of the al-Ahli hospital explosion is still uncertain, with both sides issuing interpretations of video footage as evidence of the other’s guilt. Intelligence from the Pentagon supports Israel’s assertion that the blast originated from rocket fire in Gaza. Only an impartial forensic analysis of evidence at the site can resolve that dispute. But the suggestion that Israel was behind the carnage was enough to spark demonstrations among Arab supporters of the Palestinian cause across the Middle East. Sullivan agreed Hamas is using the civilian population of Gaza as “human shields” and has put “terrorist infrastructure” in civilian areas. “But it doesn’t lessen their (Israel’s) responsibility under international humanitarian law and the laws of war to do all in their power to protect the civilian population,” he said. The difference between a terrorist group and a professional army is adherence to the laws of war. “It is crucial to understand that Israel has a legal, moral, and ethical framework for approaching questions about conduct in war,” argues Professor Emeritus of Professional Ethics and Philosophy at Tel Aviv University Asa Kasher. “Since it is Hamas policy to blur all distinctions between its members and the general population of Gaza, an Israeli attack on a Hamas military target often risks causing collateral damage, even when extensive precautions are taken. The international press and Western commentators often assume that if any noncombatants are killed in such operations, then excessive force has been used. That assumption is flawed.” Those who fight monsters… Israel’s intelligence agencies insist the Shifa Hospital is a front for Hamas terror operations. “The hospital’s energy infrastructure supposed to be used by its patients is actually used at the same time by the organisation’s underground terrorist infrastructure,” the IDF statement reads. “The leaders of the terrorist organisation use this energy while endangering the civilian population.” Israel is keen to proclaim its adherence to its interpretation of the conventions of war. But that interpretation, it insists, allows for the deliberate destruction of Palestinian civilian infrastructure. All nations have the internationally recognised right to defend their citizens from direct attack. “In the event of a terrorist attack sponsored by a de-facto governing authority, as was the case with Hamas’s murderous rampage, the attacked state may need to broaden that scope further,” Kasher states. “Thus, Israel has concluded that the only viable solution to the problem is the complete elimination of Hamas’s political and military wings.” Since the outbreak of fighting, IDF spokesmen have insisted every Hamas terrorist directly or indirectly involved in the attack “must be killed”. And every building Hamas used in that attack – or in support of that attack – must be destroyed. That means any facility related to the Gaza Strip’s Hamas government (democratically elected in 2006, but Israel and Palestine blame each other for the failure of subsequent elections) is therefore at risk of being deemed a valid target. Ultimately, however, Israel’s military and government must be able to justify these actions – both to its own people and the international community. “According to Israel’s own self-defence principle, given the kind of threat that Hamas poses–and given Israel’s resulting need to eliminate the political and military infrastructure of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – it is necessary to establish a clear limit for collateral damage,” says Professor Kasher. “There is no quantitative formula for making such determinations. But qualitative considerations are critical, including the extent and immediacy of the threat that is being acted against and the orders of magnitude of potential casualties if that threat is carried out, as well as the expected collateral damage if the threat is neutralised.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

‘Imminent catastrophe’ looms in Gaza,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-conflict-grim-fate-of-german-tattoo-artist-thought-to-have-been-kidnapped-by-hamas-revealed/news-story/e758830dc9df876451bc234073532d60,"The United States has backed Israel’s refusal to a ceasefire in Gaza, despite the humanitarian toll of its conflict with Hamas rising. An estimated 70 per cent of Palestinians killed in less than four weeks are women and children, the United Nations reports, and the region is rapidly running out of drinking water. Earlier, a chilling video circulating online appeared to show the moment an Israeli tank fired on a family in a car in Gaza. It comes as the Israeli Defence Forces ramps up its ground offensive in Gaza, but it faces a major challenge in the form of an intricate 500km network of Hamas tunnels. Meanwhile, US officials have expressed concern at repeated attacks on US troops scattered across the Middle East, fearing further escalation in other parts of the region. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said that at least 8,525 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the start of the war . The ministry said at least 3,542 children and 2,187 women were among the dead, Follow along for the latest live updates. ‘Imminent catastrophe’: Grim new Gaza warning The World Health Organisation has warned that a “public health catastrophe” in the Gaza Strip is “imminent”. While the mass displacement of civilians is obviously of concern, the greater threat is reportedly the degradation of water infrastructure, which has left Gaza with just 5 per cent of its regular water supply. That increases the risk of children dying due to dehydration. “It’s an imminent public health catastrophe that looms with the mass displacement, the overcrowding, the damage to water and sanitation infrastructure,” WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said at a briefing. “Child deaths from dehydration, particularly infant deaths due to dehydration, are a growing threat,” added James Elder, a spokesman for the UN children’s agency. Israel targets home of Hamas second-in-command The Israeli army has demolished the West Bank home of exiled Hamas number two Saleh al-Aruri. The Israeli military said forces entered the village of Arura, near Ramallah, and shot at people who were “hurling” rocks towards them during the demolition. Aruri is accused by Israel of masterminding numerous attacks. He was elected deputy to Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in 2017, before being officially named the group’s number two. Iran-backed rebels claim responsibility for drones over Israel Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels fired drones towards Israel on Tuesday in retaliation for its war against Hamas, a senior official from the group told AFP. “These drones belong to the state of Yemen,” Abdelaziz bin Habtour, prime minister of the Huthi government, said when asked about drones launched towards Eilat in southern Israel. It came as US security officials warned that repeated attacks on American troops in the Middle East risk drawing the United States into a conflict with Iran. The United States has blamed the spike in rocket and drone attacks -- at least 14 in Iraq and nine in Syria since October 17 -- on Iran-backed forces, and carried out strikes last week in Syria on sites the Pentagon said were linked to Tehran. “We are concerned about all elements of Iran’s threat network increasing their attacks in a way that risks miscalculation, or tipping the region into war,” a senior US defense official said Monday. “Everybody loses in a regional war, which is why we’re working through partners, with allies, working the phone lines, increasing posture to make clear our desire to prevent regional conflict,” the official said. Hospital workers collapsing under ‘physical and psychological stress’ Healthcare workers at Al Quds Hospital in Gaza have claimed “the whole building was shaking” overnight during another Israel’s continued assault on the city. According to Marwan Jilani, director general of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, staff “didn‘t know whether they were going to hit the hospital”. Two nearby buildings, an emergency medical centre and main warehouse, were “severely damaged and are now out of service”. Workers are now “collapsing due to the...physical and psychological stress” as they reportedly continue to await aid from humanitarian groups. “Imagine the stress on the people staying there, taking care of the patients, sheltering there - it is just immense,” Jilani told the BBC. Israel launches controversial online campaign Israel has launched a hard-hitting online campaign featuring shocking images and testimonies from the attacks carried out by Hamas on October 7. Dozens of clips of burnt bodies, bereaved families, fast-cuts of screams and sirens, rescue workers and pathologists are featured on the Israeli foreign ministry’s official social media channels and in paid advertising campaigns. The online campaign comes as Israel continues its bombing and movements into Gaza, which has killed more than 8,300 people, including over 3,000 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Some of the videos are graphic: in one clip, a pathologist describes photos of a child’s burnt body. But experts say the campaign risks alienating some audiences. There has already been some pushback, with Google limiting access to one graphic clip and a gaming firm demanding the ads be removed. “Subjecting people to images that are literally unbearable is a risky strategy,” communications expert Arnaud Mercier said via AFP. “It could be counterproductive with an audience who didn’t ask to be exposed to it.” Bombshell ‘plan’ for Gaza surfaces A draft plan to permanently relocate 2.3 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt has surfaced, which critics say they fear is the Israeli’s government true desire. Israel’s Intelligence Ministry devised the wartime proposal, which outlines the transfer of the entire population of the disputed territory to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the report was “a concept paper” drafted as part of a hypothetical exercise. But critics say even discussing the idea should be out of the question. “We are against transfer to any place, in any form, and we consider it a red line that we will not allow to be crossed,“ Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said. “What happened in 1948 will not be allowed to happen again.” Efforts for a mass displacement of Palestinians would be “tantamount to declaring a new war”, he said. A copy of the report, which said it was drafted on 13 October, just days after the Hamas massacres of 7 October, offers strategies “to effect a significant change in the civilian reality in the Gaza Strip”. It proposes moving the millions of people who reside there to tent cities in Sinai while permanent cities in a humanitarian corridor are constructed. A security perimeter would then be established on the Israeli border to prevent displaced Palestinians from returning to Gaza. The document talks about the need for Israel to garner support from regional players like Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia for the plan to succeed. Some of those nations could be encouraged to take displaced Palestinians in as refugees or permanent citizens, it added. And the document describes Canada as another potential source of support given its “lenient” immigration policies. Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told NBC News in the US that the paper threatened to damage relations between Israel and Egypt. “If this paper is true, this is a grave mistake,” Mr Guzansky said. “It might cause a strategic rift between Israel and Egypt. I see it either as ignorance or someone who wants to negatively affect Israel-Egypt relations, which are very important at this stage.” After the report emerged Mr Netanyahu’s office said it was merely a “concept paper, the likes of which are prepared at all levels of the government and its security agencies”. “The issue of the ‘day after’ has not been discussed in any official forum in Israel, which is focused at this time on destroying the governing and military capabilities of Hamas,” a spokesperson said. ‘Dumb white dogs’ sign costs dearly A Melbourne wine barembroiled in controversy for hosting an event for pro-Palestine demonstratorsto make protest banners has copped a new hit. Last week, arts precinct Collingwood Yards, home to Hope St community radio station and its popular restaurant and bar, was the site of a workshop organised by Indigenous group This Mob Arts Collective. A number of people gathered to make signs and banners ahead of a demonstration outside Victoria’s Parliament in support of Palestinians amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Images from the event show signs being painted that have now been deemed offensive by members of Melbourne’s Jewish community. One reads: “Free Palestine from the colonising dumb white dogs!! Abolish Israel!! Pussy ass baby killing bitch ass Bibi.” Bibi is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s nickname. Dvir Abramovich, chair of the Anti-Defamation Commission, slammed the poster’s open call for the “destruction of the Jewish state”. “I never thought I would see such hate-fuelled events taking place in the country that I love, and the ripple effects of such demonisation are being felt deeply by us,” Dr Abramovich said. “This venomous poster, calling for Israel to be erased, fans the flames of hostility at a dangerous time when anti-Semitism in Australia is skyrocketing, when young Jewish students are being called ‘bombers’ and are harassed schools and when Jews are singled out for abuse online. “Words matter and such incitement can lead to verbal and physical attacks and those who crafted the banner bear responsibility.” Hope St Radio and Collingwood Yards both issued statements after anger erupted online, apologising for the offence caused. But now, theAustralian Financial Reviewhas revealed one of the main financial backers of the space has pulled its support. Major law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler has written to Collingwood Yards to cease the partnership, the newspaper reports. “I and my partners are deeply disappointed that Collingwood Yards was not prepared to demonstrate the requisite moral clarity and condemn Hamas and the atrocities it committed on October 7,” Arnold Bloch Leibler senior partner Mark Leibler wrote. “Accordingly, and with great despair on our part that it has come to this, we have made the difficult decision to end our partnership with Collingwood Yards, including our representation on the board.” Following the decision, Neil Aykan, the acting chief executive of Collingwood Yards, told the AFR that banners didn’t refer to the Hamas massacres in Israel because of “word count”. “It was really a matter of keeping it succinct and keeping the word count down, otherwise it becomes beyond people’s attention span,” Mr Aykan said. Devastating toll of Israel-Hamas conflict An estimated 70 per cent of Palestinians killed during the Israel-Hamas conflict in less than four weeks are women and children, the United Nations reports. Philippe Lazzarini, chief of the UN’s Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), described the level of destruction in Gaza as “unprecedented”. As Israeli Defence Forces intensify a ground assault in the disputed territory, seeking to wipe out the Hamas terrorist organisation, the number of civilian casualties is rising. Compounding what Mr Lazzarini called a “human tragedy unfolding under our watch” is a worsening humanitarian crisis as vital aid trickles in. “Most of the people of Gaza felt abandoned,” Mr Lazzarini told a special session of the UN Security Council. “They feel the world is equating all of them to Hamas. This is dangerous, an entire population is being dehumanised.” The UN believes more than 8300 Palestinians have died so far, largely due to Israeli air strikes across Gaza. Aid organisations say at least 3400 children have been killed. “The atrocities of Hamas do not absolve the state of Israel from its obligations under international humanitarian law,” Mr Lazzarini said. “Every war has rules and this one is no exception.” Air strike on hospital condemned Turkey has slammed the bombing of a hospital it helps to funds in Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces. The Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital suffered significant damage during an air strike earlier today. Vision of the aftermath of the attack shows the building’s third floor significantly impacted, with smoke billowing into the sky. In a statement, Turkey’s foreign ministry accused Israel of deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure in violation of international law. “As all necessary information, including the coordinates of the institution in question — which is the only cancer hospital in Gaza — was shared with the Israeli authorities in advance, there is no explanation for such an attack,” the statement read. “The siege and these inhumane attacks, which aim to deprive the Palestinian people in Gaza of their most basic rights, clearly violate international law. “Israel must stop targeting Gaza residents en masse, without discrimination.” The IDF has not commented on the air strike. It is not clear if there were any fatalities as a result of the blast. Famed Palestinian activist’s sick message A young Palestinian woman who rose to fame after slapping an Israeli soldier in the face when she was a teenager has posted a graphic and disturbing message about the Israel-Hamas conflict. In 2017, a video of Ahed Tamimi, then 16, lashing out the soldier went viral, sparking a renewed focus on the plight of those in Palestine, particularly children. Ms Tamimi was arrested and charged with four offences, eventually sentenced to eight months in an Israeli prison. She became the face of the Palestinian resistance as a result. She rose to international prominence, making frequent media appearances and authoring a book. Some commentators compared her to Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai. Earlier today, Ms Tamimi took to her Instagram account to share a graphic message via her Stories to Israelis in the wake of the current conflict gripping Gaza. “Our message to the settler flocks,” a translation reads. “We are waiting for you in all the cities of the West Bank, from Hebron to Jenin. We will slaughter you and we will say [that] what Hitler did was a joke. “We will drink your blood and eat your skulls. Come forward. We are waiting for you.” The remarks have sparked condemnation on social media. Ms Tahimi’s Instagram account appears to have been suspended. Gaza on the verge of ‘catastrophe’ The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening, with United Nations organisation UNICEF warning the water supply in the region has dwindled. UNICEF chief Catherine Russell addressed a special meeting of the UN Security Council and said the situation on the ground is on the verge of “becoming a catastrophe”. “What little clean water remains in Gaza is quickly running out, leaving more than two million people in dire need,” Ms Russell said. “We estimate that 55 per cent of the water supply infrastructure requires repair or rehabilitation. “Only one desalination plant is operating at just five per cent capacity, while all six of Gaza’s water-waste treatment plants are now non-operational due to the lack of fuel or power.” More civilians will likely die from dehydration of disease if clean water isn’t available, she warned. Aussies hit up for Hamas donations Australians are being urged to donate to Hamas on the social media platform Telegraph, according to reports. The militant group, which Australia recognises as a terrorist organisation, is asking for financial support in the form of cryptocurrency – a move that could land donors in jail. Ari Redbord, the global head of policy at blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, told ABC News 24 said cryptocurrency is a small part of the Hamas terror financing operation. “But it is a part nonetheless and needs to be cut-off,” Mr Redbord said in an interview. “Hamas was an earlier adopter of crypto. We saw Hamas fundraising in cryptocurrencies in about 2019. They did it on Telegram channels and stood up website infrastructure to solicit donations in crypto.” In 2020, the United States Justice Department seized some 150 crypto wallets associated with Hamas, he said. Australia’s financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC is working with the Australian Federal Police to counter donation appeals on Telegram. The Australian Financial Review reported one channel on the network, titled Support Palestine, was urging Aussies to donate to “help our fighters, as well as civilians”. Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said Australians who contribute financially to Hamas are breaking strict anti-terror laws. “It’s illegal under Australian law to provide material support to Hamas, a listed terrorist organisation, including by providing any form of monetary support,” Ms O’Neil told the AFR. “Australians who want to send support to civilians in Gaza should do so through a reputable aid organisation like the Red Cross, who will make sure that money assists people in need and not a terrorist organisation that is engaged in horrific violence against innocent men, women and children.” Israeli tank ‘fires on civilian car’ A disturbing video circulating on social media appears to show the moment an Israeli tank fires on a car full of civilians in Gaza. The BBC has worked to independently verify the video, geolocating it to the sole highway linking Gaza’s north to the south, Salah- al-Din Road. In it, photographers in another vehicle down the street can be seen observing the white vehicle as it comes to a stop and begin to turn around to travel away from the tank. It’s then the car is fired on as it drives in the opposite direction, engulfed in plumes of smoke. The photographers watching yell and speed away from the scene. They can be heard screaming that “a whole family” was in the car when it was shot at. TheWall Street Journalreports the car was a taxi with a white flag draped on its bonnet. Freelance photographer Bashar Talib told NBC News he filmed the incident, saying the car appeared to see the tank “at the last minute”. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer,” Mr Talib told the US network. “He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving.” A journalist in the car, Yousaf Al Saifi, told Sky News it appeared the occupants of the white vehicle were killed. “They fired on him,” Mr Al Saifi told the UK news service. “The driver tried turning back, he had a family with him. I saw the family in the car. They struck [the car] with a shell and they died. We saw it with our own eyes.” The road is one of two routes Israel told Palestinians to use to evacuate northern Gaza heading south. Israeli Defence Forces Major Nir Dinar told The Wall Street Journal that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars”. He added: “The IDF was not shown any proof that this is a civilian car and there’s no information on who is inside.” A local told the newspaper that the tank quickly left the area after the incident.

Chilling look inside the ‘Hamas Metro’ If Israel is to succeed in ridding Gaza of the Hamas terrorist network, it faces a significant challenging in finding and destroying a vast tunnel system that runs beneath the disputed territory. Known as the ‘Hamas Metro’, the tunnels are believed to have played a central role in moving militants into surprise attack positions to carry out horrifying massacres on Israeli citizens on 7 October. Intelligence service Mossad now believes many of the 230 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas are captive deep underground. In public statements made in 2021, Hamas political leader Yehia Sinwar said the group had 500km of tunnels. To put that into perspective, the Gaza Strip itself is about 360 square kilometres. If true, the size of that tunnel system is vaster than London’s Underground train network. Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old Israeli hostage who was freed by Hamas after a fortnight of captivity, said she was held within the tunnels. “Eventually we went underground and walked for kilometres in wet tunnels, for two or three hours, in a spider‘s web of tunnels,” Ms Lifshitz told reporters. “We went through the tunnels until we reached a large hall.” Construction of the tunnel system began 20 years ago and was initially designed to connect Gaza with Egypt in order to smuggle banned goods and weapons. At some point in recent years, Hamas pivoted and ramped up the spread of tunnels for the specific use of waging war. They are concrete-reinforced and connected to electricity and telecommunications. Some sections are metres high, allowing militants to comfortable walk upright, while parts are wide enough to drive missile-loaded trucks through, according to reports. In 2004, Israeli Defence Forces formed the Samur unit, colloquially known as the ‘Weasals’, to infiltrate and destroy tunnels beneath Gaza. Troops enter wearing oxygen masks and plant C4 explosives. Remote-controlled robots are also dispatched. Ben Milch was part of the squad in 2014 and tole theMail Onlinethat he uncovered tunnels leading directly into Israel from Gaza. “One telltale sign was sometimes a pulley system fixed to the side of a house for moving the excavated earth, and when we dug below, we‘d find the tunnel usually about 15-foot deep,” Mr Milch told the outlet. “In other places, there would be a steel trapdoor inside a room in a house or mosque. Our job wasn‘t to enter the tunnels, just to destroy them.” Last week, the IDF said a Hamas underground command centre next to the Al-Shifa Hospital – Gaza’s largest health facility – was discovered and bombed. Multiple air strikes throughout the region over the past week have specifically targeted tunnels. In an interview on Russian state television last week, senior Hamas figure Mousa Abu Marzouk said the tunnels were built to protect terrorists – not Palestinian civilians. Israel is reported to have developed a weapon called a “sponge bomb” as part of its operations targeting the Hamas tunnels. The IDF has not commented on the existence of the devices, but UK newspaperThe Telegraphreported they are chemical weapons that explode and spray out foam that hardens. This is a modal window.

German tattoo artist confirmed dead German tattoo artist Shani Louk, whose plight inspired attention around the world after she was thought to have been abducted from a music festival by Hamas, has been found dead. Ms Louk, 22, was paraded semi-naked through Gaza on the back of a truck in the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ 7 October attacks. “It is with great sadness that we announce the death of my sister, Shani Nicole Z.L., who was on October 7, 2023, at the party massacre in Re’im,” her sister Adi wrote on Instagram. While Ms Louk’s full remains have yet to be found, her mother Ricarda said she was told by the Israeli military that a DNA sample, taken from a skull bone, proved to be hers. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Ms Louk had been beheaded. “These barbaric, sadistic animals simply chopped off her head as they attacked, tortured and killed Israelis,” Mr Herzog said. “It is a great tragedy and I extend my deepest condolences to her family.” Ms Louk’s father told Israeli news site N12 that authorities believe she was shot and killed 10 minutes after fleeing the music festival. It suggests she was dead in the Hamas footage showing her lying motionless in the back of a truck. “Until about 6.45am [on 7 October], Shani was still dancing, cheering and going wild at the party and was surrounded by all her best friends,” Mr Louk told N12. “She was killed on the spot, and not only did she not suffer, but 10 minutes earlier she was still enjoying herself.” Eerie installation honours hostages Israelis have gathered to honour the more than 200 hostages who remain captives of Hamas in Gaza, at a moving public art installation in Jerusalem. The Installation of Empty Beds in Safra Square was organised by survivors of the 7 October massacre and loved ones of those kidnapped by militants. It features 239 beds, mattresses, cots and bassinets arranged outside the Jerusalem Municipality building, symbolising the missing men, women and children. Horrors in Gaza hospitals revealed International charity Save The Children says one child is being killed every 10 minutes during the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. And of the 20,000 Palestinian civilians who have been injured so far, the group’s director of operations in Palestine Jason Lee said one-in-three are kids. In an interview with the BBC, he also spoke of the horrific conditions doctors in Gaza hospitals are working under. “Surgeons are doing surgeries without anaesthetic, people are using mobile phones as flashlights to have lights in health facilities,” Mr Lee told the British broadcaster. Substandard hygiene practices and overcrowding have also seen a surge in communicable diseases among patients, he said. Turkish Palestinian Hospital in Gaza was reportedly damaged by an Israeli air strike overnight, with the oxygen system and water supply affected. Meanwhile, Catherine Russell, head of the United Nations’ agency UNICEF estimated some 420 children are being killed each day. The death toll “quickly adding up” with “rampant grave violations” being committed, Ms Russell told a sitting of the UN Security Council overnight. UNICEF believes more than 3400 children have died in Gaza since 7 October. Some 6300 have been injured, it estimates. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Prince Harry claim in Nazi case,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/three-men-deny-performing-nazi-salute-at-sydneys-jewish-museum/news-story/bca65132b0197e2759e7a8524afef60d,"A high-profile lawyer representing one of three men accused of performing Nazi salutes outside Sydney’s Jewish Museum has denied his client was guilty, because he has never owned or worn a Nazi uniform. Ryan Peter Marshall, Daniel Muston and Anthony Raymond Mitchell pleaded not guilty to behaving in an offensive manner near a public place/school and knowingly displaying by public act a Nazi symbol without excuse. All three men entered pleas of not guilty to both charges on Tuesday, while high-profile solicitor Bryan Wrench said there is “no history of Nazi sympathising”. Mr Wrench said his client has never worn Nazi paraphernalia and used Prince Harry and former Premier Dominic Perrottet as examples in his defence. Representing Mr Muston, Mr Wrench told the court: “I want to talk about Mr Muston’s case for a moment … there’s an allegation of use of Nazi symbols”. “There was no Nazi paraphernalia on them … there was no swastikas and no Nazi uniforms – unlike the former Premier Dominic Perrottet or Prince Harry”. The trio are accused of performing Nazi salutes outside the Sydney Jewish Museum at Darlinghurst shortly before midday on October 13. Earlier this year, Mr Perrottet revealed he wore a Nazi uniform at his 21st birthday party and apologised, saying it was “deeply hurtful” and he was “ashamed”. Following the alleged incident by the three men, NSW Premier Chris Minns said he was “extremely concerned” about the allegations. The premier said there was “no place for that in NSW” and expected the “full extent of the law” to be applied to the three co-accused. “I want to make it clear there will be no tolerance for racial vilification in NSW or incitement to violence. It’s not going to happen. Police are vigilant, there is no tolerance for it,” Mr Minns said. But in court on Tuesday, Mr Wrench said he was concerned about the “use of powers” by the premier. Outside court, Mr Wrench reiterated his messaging and insisted his client was “not a Nazi”. “He’s never had a swastika, and more importantly he’s never worn a uniform or owned a uniform … he’s not guilty,” Mr Wrench said. Upol Amin, representing Mr Marshall, told media outside court the world is living through “sensitive times” and made clear the matter “had nothing to do with Israel and Palestine” but was just a “big misunderstanding”. “We hope the misunderstanding will be cleared up by the courts in due course,” Mr Amin said as his client tried to hide from cameras. Mr Mitchell declined to comment to media as he left the court alongside his partner. The alleged incident occurred just days after an escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine, when militant group Hamas fired more than 3500 rockets in a surprise attack. More than 1000 Israeli civilians were killed at a music festival while armed militants also stormed Jewish communities, killing and capturing hostages. Israel has since responded with force in the escalating conflict, firing thousands of rockets into Gaza in a “complete siege” of the region, flattening dozens of buildings. As the conflict continues, NSW Police say they are committed to keeping the community safe. “NSW Police are working strongly with all communities to keep them safe and Eastern Suburbs police area command particularly are working with our partners in government, as well as our local community leaders, schools, and synagogues to keep everyone safe,” Detective Superintendent Jodie Radmore said on Thursday. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Fury at Netanyahu’s accusation,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-conflict-angry-mob-storms-major-airport-hunting-for-jews/news-story/771ede76128f055ae040482a4833849b,"Israel looks set to intensify its military operations in Gaza imminently, after sending a final warning to civilians to flee the area and head south. It comes as air strikes on Palestine intensified overnight, including in an area close to a major hospitals filled with hundreds of wounded people. Israel’s military says it struck more than 600 targets in Gaza in the past 24 hours, one of the heaviest bombardments yet in the current conflict. The humanitarian crisis in the region is worsening, with a stockpile of aid ransacked by desperate people. Meanwhile, a terrifying security incident has unfolded at a major airport in Russia, with a furious mob of men seizing control of the facility and surrounding a plane “hunting for Jews”. Follow along for live updates of the Israel-Hamas conflict. German tattoo artist has been killed German tatto artist Shani Louk, whose plight inspired attention around the world after she was abducted from a music festival by Hamas, has reportedly been found dead. Ms Louk, 22, was paraded semi-naked through Gaza on the back of a truck in the immediate aftermath of Hamas’s October 7 attacks. “It is with great sadness that we announce the death of my sister, Shani Nicole Z.L., who was on October 7, 2023, at the party massacre in Re’im,” her sister Adi wrote on Instagram. The Israeli foreign ministry said Ms Louk had endured “unfathomable horrors”. While Ms Louk’s body has yet to be found, her mother Ricarda said she was told by the Israeli military that a DNA sample, taken from a skull bone, proved to be hers. The Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, said Ms Louk had been beheaded. “These barbaric, sadistic animals simply chopped off her head as they attacked, tortured and killed Israelis,” Mr Herzog said. “It is a great tragedy and I extend my deepest condolences to her family.” Four killed in West Bank clash Four Palestinians were killed on Monday during an early-morning Israeli raid in the northern West Bank city of Jenin. According to the official Palestinian agency Wafa, “more than 100 military vehicles and two bulldozers” took part in the raid in the city and its refugee camp, which is a stronghold of Palestinian armed groups. Wafa reported military drones hovered over the area during the raid, while snipers were positioned on buildings around the city’s main hospital. Part of the hospital’s perimeter wall was also demolished by military bulldozers. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incident. The deaths come a day after five Palestinians were killed by army fire during several military incursions into the West Bank. Evacuation impossible for hospital patients: UN agency The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says there are hundreds of injured people in Gaza hospitals who are incapable of evacuating to the south after Israel’s updated warning to civilians on Monday. Several people in Gaza’s north are left stranded because they “physically don’t have the transportation”, according to the agency’s head, Tom White. “Many people in the north are seeking shelter in UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) schools, they’re seeking shelter in hospitals,” he said. “I was up and one of the hospitals this week and there are hundreds and hundreds of patients that can’t be moved.” The agency says clean water is scarce in parts of Gaza and said they are working on delivering food to civilians as the bombs continue to drop. Fury at Netanyahu’s accusation Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been forced to delete a tweet where he accused security chiefs of failing to warn him about the devastating Hamas attack before October 7. In the now-deleted post on X, Mr Netanyahu said: “At no point was a warning given to Prime Minister Netanyahu on Hamas’s intention to start a war. On the contrary, all the defence officials, including the heads of the Intelligence Directorate and the Shin Bet, assessed that Hamas was deterred.” Opposition leader and former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid accused Mr Netanyahu of “crossing a red line” by attributing blame to the security services. “The attempts to evade responsibility and place the blame on the security establishment weakens the IDF while it is fighting Israel’s enemies,” he said. Following the backlash, Mr Netanyahu deleted the post on Sunday morning, stating Israel’s security heads had his “full backing”. “I was wrong. Things I said following the press conference should not have been said and I apologise for that,” he wrote on X. Pro-Palestine group criticises former PMs The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network has claimed “six of the seven living former Australian Prime Ministers have allowed themselves to be used as tool in a campaign by the pro-Israel lobby” after former leaders signed a joint statement on Monday. The group claims the statement “demonstrated explicit pro-Israel bias, failing to recognise Israeli responsibility for bombings that have already killed more than 8000 people in Gaza”. “I’m most disturbed by the fact that six of our former Prime Ministers signed this statement knowing that it ignores Israel’s current and historical violations of international law,” spokesman Nasser Mashni said. “The statement’s reference to ‘Australian values of love and respect’ rings hollow, given that the former Prime Ministers failed to acknowledge the tens of thousands of Australians expressing their horror about Israel’s behaviour, and ignored the anguish that many thousands of Palestinian Australians are currently feeling. “The Prime Ministers have failed in their duty as states people to equally uphold international law. Their significant platform should have been used to echo calls by the United Nations for an immediate ceasefire. “How the former Prime Ministers could have the audacity to quote religious texts about peace while Israel is carpet bombing two million people in Gaza is gut-wrenching hypocrisy. “Clearly Paul Keating wasn’t going to allow himself to be a pawn played by lobby groups, and we are disappointed others didn’t follow his example.” Context behind hostage’s handshake with captor The daughter of Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old woman released from Hamas last week, has shed light on the puzzling image of her shaking hands with a balaclava-clad captor. Daughter Sharone said many in the region still believe that “we have to find a way forward” to escape the perpetual conflict between Israel and Palestine. “My mum’s gesture when she turned to that person, who has been kind and was a paramedic, that was what was needed,” she said in an interview with the BBC. Lifshitz said that after initial violence, which saw her tied to a motorbike and taken to Gaza, her Hamas captors had shown “care” and “gentleness”. Analysts have described the moment as a much-needed show of humanity as the region sits through its darkest hour. The family is still eagerly awaiting news about Lifshitz’s husband, who is still being held by the terrorist group. Death toll passes 8000: Palestinian Ministry of Health The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah has now confirmed the number of people killed during Israeli strikes on Gaza since October 7 has risen past 8000. Some 73 per cent of those killed are from vulnerable populations, including children, women and elderly people. The reported death toll includes 116 medical staff. Twelve hospitals and 32 primary care centre have now been put out of service due to strikes or a lack of fuel. Palestinian officials say it will be impossible to evacuate every patient from hospitals after Israel’s new warning for all civilians to move south. Gaza civilians forced to make unthinkable decision A UK politician with family members stuck in Gaza has provided a chilling glimpse of life on the ground as Israel continues relentless bombing attacks. MP Layla Moran said “nowhere in Gaza is safe”, revealing some of her extended family were sheltering in a church after their home was reduced to rubble. “The conversion in Gaza now I’m afraid to say has changed. No longer are people saying, ‘where do we go to be safe?’” she said the to BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. “The question they are now asking is, ‘where do we want to be when we die?’” She said communications blackouts in Gaza have made it difficult to know what’s happening, and where. “I can’t tell you what that did to us as a family. Not knowing if they were dead or alive.” Israel has blamed Hamas for putting civilians in danger by placing weapons and forces near hospitals and has urged people still in Gaza city to immediately move south. Former Aussie PMs release historic joint letter Six former prime ministers have co-authored an open letter condemning Hamas, urging Australians not to “turn against each other”, and calling for peace via a two-state solution. In a historic show of unity, John Howard, Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison issued the joint statement on Monday. Paul Keating, who was prime minister in the first half of the 1990s and remains a beloved Labor Party figure, declined to take part – making him the only living former PM to do so. “Our multicultural nation’s success is founded on the Australian values we all share and the respect we show for our fellow Australians’ diversity of cultures and faiths,” the letter begins. “Whatever is happening elsewhere in the world, there is no place in our country for racial or religious hatred. And there is no more tenaciously evil race hatred than antisemitism.” The former PMs expressed their support for the Jewish community, speaking for “the vast majority of Australians, of all faiths and of none” in standing in solidarity with them. “Likewise, we stand too with the Australian Palestinian community whose families are dying and suffering in this terrible conflict,” the letter continued. “They too deserve our love and support.” The letter detailed at length condemnation of the massacre waged by Hamas on October 7 and demanded the release of some 200 Israelis who are still held captive by the terrorist group. “After raining thousands of rockets down on Israel, Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and kidnapped and murdered 1400 Israelis; young and old, women and men, children – not even babies were spared. “It was the single largest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust and its grotesque cruelty and violence was comparable to that of ISIS.” In addition, the former PMs said they are “horrified by the thousands of deaths and injuries inflicted on innocent Palestinian civilians, including many, many Palestinian children”. “We endorse, as we did in office, the Australian Government’s enduring support for a two-state solution as the basis for long-term lasting peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples,” the letter concluded. “At this time, more than ever, we must in the words of the 34th Psalm: ‘Seek peace and pursue it.’ And here at home that is done by defending our Australian values, condemning hate speech and intolerance and respecting the people of Australia in all our diversity.” Jeremy Leibler, president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, praised the letter and said the Jewish community was “humbled and touched by their support”. It has publishedthe letter in fullon its website. Israel sends ‘urgent message’ to Gaza civilians Israel looks set to dramatically intensify its assault on Gaza, with its Defence Forces issuing an “urgent message” to civilians to evacuate now. The “window” to move south from northern Gaza and Gaza City is rapidly closing, a military spokesman said, and the plea is “not a precaution”. “Attention citizens of Gaza – listen carefully,” Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari begins the video address. “For your immediate safety, we urge all residents of northern Gaza and Gaza city to temporarily relocate south. “Hamas puts your life in danger by placing weapons and forces within civilian areas in Gaza, including schools, mosques and hospitals.” The chilling warning has been met with alarm, given large parcels of Gaza are without telephone and internet access after it was severed by Israel days ago. In some areas, fuel shortages mean electricity supply has become unreliable. There are fears that many civilians – already displaced by relentless air strikes – will not see the message to evacuate before it’s too late. Popular social media streamer Phuzzy took to X, formerly Twitter, to share his shock, writing: “Step 1: Cutoff the internet. Step 2: Use the internet to send them an urgent message.” In response to the criticism, the IDF took to social media to say it’s spreading the message as widely as it can. “This is a good opportunity to mention that we’ve said this countless times for over two weeks, including: Dropping paper pamphlets across Gaza, Arabic social media, international media, phone calls to residents of Gaza and more.” In his video message, Rear Admiral Hagari said an “impending IDF operation is set to neutralise the threat of Hamas with precision and intensity”. Israel began its ground offensive at the weekend, but it was more subdued than the country had promised. That could change imminently. “To the residents of northern Gaza and Gaza City, your window to act is closing,” Rear Admiral Hagari said. “Move south for your own safety. Move south. This is not a mere precaution – it is an urgent plea for the safety of civilians.” He insisted the evacuation was a “temporary measure” and said “moving back to northern Gaza” will be possible once “intense hostilities” end. “Humanity remains haunted by the massacre unleashed by Hamas on October 7 – a massacre of innocent lives. Israeli men, women, children and babies were beheaded, executed, raped and burnt alive. “We won’t forget that. And the kidnapping of over 200 Israelis – we will not forget.” Israel begins ‘phase two’ of Hamas offensive Israel has commenced the “second stage” of its war with Hamas in Palestine, which the prime minister warned will be “long and difficult”. Troops crossed the border into Gaza at the weekend and have advanced some three kilometres, according to analysis by CNN. The ground offensive coincided with a ramp up of air strikes, targeting Hamas command posts and underground tunnel networks. Bombing surrounding Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Quds, sparked condemnation from humanitarian groups, who said an order to evacuate was unreasonable. However, the Israeli Defence Forces said Hamas has built bunkers beneath the hospital. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the next phase of the conflict was “do or die”. “There are moments in which a nation faces two possibilities: to do or die,” Mr Netanyahu said. “We now face that test and I have no doubt how it will end: We will be the victors. We will do, and we will be the victors.” It marked his first press conference taking questions since the 7 October terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians. Mr Netanyahu described the swift retaliation as “our second Independence War”. “We will fight to protect our country. We will fight on land, in the sea and in the air. We will destroy the enemy above ground and underground.” Ground operations were designed to “destroy the military and government capabilities of Hamas” while also seeking to free hundreds of Israeli hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza. Despite the advancement of ground troops, the operation is much more subdued than the all-out offensive that had been promised. The reason for the apparent restraint is advice from the United States, according to The Times of Israel, which quoted an unnamed American official. “The Biden administration has pushed Israel to carry out a more limited ground operation in the Gaza Strip, as the IDF is currently conducting in the northern part of the enclave,” the outlet reported. “The US official says Israel’s leaders also currently oppose an all-out ground offensive at this stage because it could well risk the hostages currently in Gaza; and accordingly did not need pressure from Washington in order to choose the current military path.” The White House is said to have “scepticism regarding Israel’s broader strategy”, it added. No American boots on the ground, Harris insists The United States has “no intention” of sending ground troops to Israel or Gaza, Vice President Kamala Harris has insisted. In an interview with the American television program 60 Minutes earlier, Ms Harris echoed the sentiments of President Joe Biden in saying that Israel “has a right to defend itself”. “A terrorist organisation, Hamas, slaughtered hundreds of young people at a concert,” she told the program. “By most estimates at least fourteen hundred Israelis are dead. Israel, without any question, has a right to defend itself. “That being said, it is very important that there be no conflation between Hamas and the Palestinians. The Palestinians deserve equal measures of safety and security, self-determination and dignity, and we have been very clear that the rules of war must be adhered to and that there be humanitarian aid that flows.” The US is not directing Israel what to do militarily, but Ms Harris said it was providing advice, equipment and diplomatic support. While American warships have travelled to the region and some 2000 troops have been told to prepare to deploy, the manoeuvres are meant to act as a deterrent to Iran and its sponsored militants in the region. “We have absolutely no intention nor do we have any plans to send combat troops into Israel or Gaza, period,” Ms Harris said. Israel air strikes ‘targeting hospitals’ A Palestinian aid organisation has accused Israel of deliberately targeting hospitals in northern Gaza, putting patients at risk. Palestinian Red Crescent Society levelled the accusation in a statement to the media, saying the Israeli Defence Force has repeatedly bombed the area surrounding Al-Quds hospital. “This has caused significant damage to hospital departments and exposed residents and patients to suffocation,” the statement read. “The Israeli army deliberately continues to launch rockets directly near Al-Quds hospital with the aim of forcing medical staff, displaced individuals and patients to evacuate the hospital.” The Israeli Defence Force issued an evacuation order for the hospital, which doctors told BBC was not possible without risking patient safety. A report from the BBC quotes a doctor at Al-Quds saying that “heavy bombardment has now begun in the vicinity”. “Everyone, everyone, especially the children, is terrified,” the doctor was quoted as saying. “They bomb the [residential] towers behind the hospital.” The BBC also quoted a resident near the hospital as saying: “They have bombed two residential towers and now they’re bombing the third one. God protect us.” Footage shared by the British broadcaster shows rooms inside the hospital filled with dust and with windows shattered. Israel vows ‘independence war’ as air strikes intensify A defiant Benjamin Netanyahu has declared Israel is fighting “its second War of Independence” as the country kicked off its ground offensive in Gaza. While the much-anticipated move is so far more subdued than the Israeli prime minister had been hinting at, relentless air strikes continue in the disputed territory. Mr Netanyahu stopped short of describing the operation as an invasion, but insisted Israel would not waver. The Israeli Defence Force confirmed 450 attacks had been carried out on Hamas targets throughout Palestine in the past 24 hours, including on the terrorist group’s headquarters and antitank positions. Palestine officials say the IDF has ordered the evacuation of multiple hospitals in Gaza, with air strikes occurring close to major health facilities. Hamas leaders killed in air strikes Two senior Hamas leaders have been killed in Israeli air strikes in Gaza, including the mastermind of an attack on a music festival by a group of paragliders. Israeli Defence Force officials reported Asem Abu Rakaba and Rateb Abu Tshaiban had been eliminated, alongside a number of other high-ranking members of the terrorist organisation. “IDF fighter jets struck Asem Abu Rakaba, The head of Hamas’ Aerial Array,” it said. Abu Rakaba orchestrated the massacre on the Supernova festival in Israel on 7 October, where hundreds of people were killed when terrorists parachuted in. Abu Tshaiban was the commander of Hamas’ naval forces and had planned an infiltration of Israel by sea – a plot that was ultimately foiled. More kids killed in Gaza than anywhere else More children have been killed in Gaza in the past three weeks than in all other global conflicts annually over the past four years, a leading humanitarian group claims. Save the Children made the stark assessment in a social media post about the worsening civilian cost of the Israel-Hamas conflict. The Palestinian health authority say 3195 children have died since 7 October. That figure cannot be independently verified and the terrorist group Hamas controls the information released. However, Save the Children said the death toll is staggering and has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. “The numbers are harrowing and with violence not only continuing but expanding in Gaza right now, many more children remain at grave risk,” Jason Lee, the organisation’s country director in Palestine, told CNN. According to the United Nations, 2985 children died in armed conflicts across 24 countries in 2022, while the figure was 2515 in 2021, and 2674 in 2020. Iran’s chilling warning to the US Iran has warned that Israel has “crossed the red lines” in Gaza and its ground offensive “may force everyone to take action”. The stark statement from Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, marks an escalation of rhetoric from the Islamic Republic. “The crimes of the Zionist regime have crossed the red lines, and this may force everyone to take action,” Raisi wrote. “Washington asks us to not do anything, but they keep giving widespread support to Israel.” He said the US has “sent messages to the Axis of Resistance” and received “a clear response on the battlefield”. The term ‘Axis of Resistance’ refers to Iranian allies across the region, including Hamas in Palestine, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shiite militants in Iraq and Syria, and Yemen group Houthis. It’s unclear what Raisi meant with the reference to “a clear response on the battlefield” however there have been a string of alarming encounters between the US and rebels. In the past few days, a US navy ship intercepted missiles launched by rebels in Yemen and two American bases in Syria briefly came under attack. Meanwhile, in Iraq, US troops came under fire from rockets and weaponised drones. Tensions are running high across the Middle East and the US has dispatched two carrier groups to the eastern Mediterranean, hoping to send a message to Iran and its allies to stay out of the conflict. Some 2000 American troops are also on standby for ground deployment if needed. Ben Wedeman is CNN’s senior international correspondent based in Beirut in Lebanon and wrote in an analysis piece that “across the Middle East the warning lights of more trouble to come are blinking red”. A combination of devastating factors are threatening to collide, Wedeman wrote. “It all amounts to this: the United States is careening closer to the very real possibility of direct involvement in a regional Middle Eastern war. “Now, at best, the US is scrambling to respond to events largely out of its control. “And in this dangerous terrain, suddenly the vulnerabilities of the sprawling American military presence across the Middle East are glaringly obvious.” In the past few days, a US navy ship intercepted missiles launched by rebels in Yemen and two American bases in Syria briefly came under attack. Meanwhile, in Iraq, US troops came under fire from rockets and weaponised drones. Pro-Palestine mob ‘hunting for Jews’ An angry mob took control of a large airport and surrounded a plane they believed had just arrived from Israel, searching for Jewish people. The frightening security breach took place at Makhachkala Airport in Russia’s Dagestan Republic on Sunday night local time. Videos posted to social media show a large group of men, some draped in or holding Palestinian flags, storming the airport after word spread that a flight from Israel had landed. Crowds can be seen running through the main terminal and then breaching a security screening area, smashing their way through locked doors in the process. Hundreds of men then make their way onto the tarmac and surround an aircraft. A photographer who shared one clip wrote alongside it: “The hunt for Jews at the airport in Dagestan continues, to the soundtrack of ‘Allahu Akbar’ screams. “They even look into the plane’s engines, maybe someone is hiding there. Pogroms, a proud Russian tradition, now carried out by Muslim mobs running free with zero police presence.” According to a report in the Moscow Times, some of the men blocked cars outside the airport and demanded identification documents from drivers and passengers, as they “searched for Israeli citizens among the motorists”. In one clip, a group can be seen attacking a white police vehicle. Officials insisted security measures were working and said order was eventually restored at the airport. “The government of the Republic of Dagestan is reporting that the situation is under control, law enforcement is working at the scene,” the majority-Muslim republic’s government said in a message shared on Telegram. Shortly after 10pm local time, Russian security forces seized back control of the airport and cleared out the demonstrators, with some 20 people injured in the process, Reuters reported. All flights have been diverted and the airport could remain closed for the next several days. It appears the plane that landed had not arrived from Israel, however the rumours that circulated in town were correct – a flight from Tel Aviv was scheduled to land on Sunday evening. However, the flight was diverted to a nearby air field after pilots were warned of the security breach on the ground, according to reports. Passengers on board the plane in Makhachkala that was surrounded are safe, authorities told Reuters. The government called on the mob to “stop illegal acts” and resist the urge to respond to “provocations” resulting from the Israel-Hamas conflict. “We recommend that all persons who have violated the operating procedures of the (airport) facility not to continue illegal acts and not to interfere with the work of airport employees,” a message from the government on Telegram read. “It is not easy for each of us to stand in one place while watching the inhumane massacre of a civilian population – the Palestinian people. “At the same time, we urge residents of the republic not to succumb to provocations of destructive groups and not to create panic in society.” The government added that “federal authorities and international organisations are taking all possible measures for a ceasefire against peaceful citizens in Gaza”. “We call on people of the republic to treat the current situation in the world with understanding.” Jordan asks US for missile system Jordan has asked the United States to deploy its Patriot air defence system to its border, concerned about an escalation throughout the region. The kingdom is facing growing threats from ballistic missiles, Jordanian military spokesman Brigadier General Mustafa Al-Hiyari told state television. America’s Patriot missile defence system is “the best weapon to confront such a threat”. “We asked the American side to strengthen our defence system with Patriot missiles. This system is expensive and cannot be employed with local capabilities, and we need a strategic partner.” Pointed post swiping pro-Palestine protests Israel has taken a swipe at pro-Palestine protesters in New York in a pointed post on social media. Vision of a demonstrator waving a combined Palestine and rainbow flag at a rally in Brooklyn quickly went viral, particularly after it was re-shared by Israel’s official account on X, formerly Twitter. “A combined LGBTQ + Palestine flag in New York protest today. Why are there so many ‘queers FOR Palestine’, but absolutely no ‘queers IN Palestine’? “Looking forward to seeing Hamas raise the rainbow flag across Gaza as a thank you for your solidarity.” Politician’s sick Hitler remark A politician in Pakistan has sparked outrage after taking to social media to invoke Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust to attack Israel over its conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Senator Afnan Ullah Khan posted an image of Hitler on X, formerly Twitter, with the caption: “At least now the world know [sic], why he did, what he did.” Countless users condemned his words and Mr Khan later deleted the message. It now appears his entire X profile has been removed. The politician was the youngest senator ever elected in Pakistan in 2021. He was educated in the United Kingdom and received a doctorate in IT from Oxford.  Foreign Minister Penny Wong has revealed 88 Australians, family members and visa holders remain stuck in Gaza. The government is working to secure safe passage amid the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict, hopeful the Rafah border crossing with Egypt can be opened. “We have 88 Australians and families, so that’s citizens, those on visas and family members, and we have been working since this conflict began to try and get them out of Gaza,” Senator Wong told the ABC. “We’re in the same situation, very sadly, that every other nation with foreign nationals is … in terms of foreign nationals in Gaza. There has not been exit permitted.” ‘We gotta go, f***’: Seven news crew flee An Australian news crew reporting from the Israel-Palestine border was forced to run for cover as a Hamas rocket exploded above them. Channel 7 journalist David Woiwod was crossing live to the network’s Early News program just after 6am when he and his cameraman had “a very close call”. “I don’t know if you can hear those blasts in the background,” Woiwod said as exploding rockets could be seen in the distance. “We have a flare going up there,” he added, pointing out Israel’s air defence system intercepting strikes. As the sound of firing rockets grew closer, Woiwod – who was near Sderot on the Israeli border – could be seen gazing upwards in panic. “In fact, I think we might have to go now,” he said. “We gotta go, f***.” As he ran out of shot, an explosion could be heard and the feed was cut. Back in a studio in Sydney, Channel 7 anchor Jodie Speers quickly moved on to other stories. Woiwod returned to screens about an hour later, where he told Sunrise about the chilling moment he had to run for his life. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

We have pushed right back, the IDF have detected what they believe to be an antitank missile in the area as well.” Israel launches air strikes in Lebanon The Israeli Air Force has carried out a series of strikes on Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon in response to rocket and missile fire from the militant group. Targets included “infrastructure for directing terror and military infrastructure” controlled by the group, a defence spokesman said in a statement. Aerial footage of the strikes has been distributed to media. Desperate scenes in Gaza The “fabric of society” in Gaza is deteriorating, an official from the United Nationals Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has declared. In an interview with CNN, UNRWA director of Affairs for Gaza Thomas White said desperate civilians have looted aid stockpiles in the war-torn region. “We have been warning for a couple days now that if essential public services and humanitarian aid would not be provided to the population in a sustained way we would see a breakdown in civil order,” Mr White told the cable news network. “What we are seeing right now is the first stages of that, and that some of our logistic bases were looted by hundreds of young men. “It’s a very worrying sign that the fabric of society is starting to break down.” UNRWA has called for a “humanitarian ceasefire” so aid organisations can “get the assistance that people need and stabilise society in Gaza”. Biden demands flow of aid US President Joe Biden has called for Israel to “immediately and significantly increase” the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Mr Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke via telephone about the ongoing conflict, a statement from the White House revealed. Access to clean water and fuel remains limited throughout Gaza, as does food and medical equipment. Hospitals are at risk of losing power, which would endanger thousands of patients, the World Health Organisation reports. “[The president] reiterated that Israel has every right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism and underscored the need to do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law that prioritises the protection of civilians,” the White House said. Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu also “discussed ongoing efforts to locate and secure the release of hostages, including American citizens who remain unaccounted for and may be held by Hamas”. The pair have committed to “remain in regular consultation both directly and through their respective national security teams”. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
‘Healthy ones only’: Hamas lie exposed,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/only-the-healthy-are-released-hamas-lie-that-hostages-have-been-released-for-humanitarian-reasons-exposed/news-story/53c50f74c4028805be7a73c14e1f2ba9,"In the high stakes game of hostage negotiations between Hamas and Israel, the reason why certain hostages are released while many more remain captive is unknown. But experts say the idea that those captured are released on “humanitarian grounds” because of poor health is simply a lie. Since the deadly October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, an American mother and daughter as well as two Israeli grandmothers have been released. Robert D’Amico, a former FBI agent who worked on hostage cases overseas told theNew York Times, that rather than suffering from ill health, the hostages may have actually been released because they are “healthy”. “I don’t know if you want to release critically wounded ones,” he said. “It just looks bad.” Several hostages were badly injured before they were captured, with some having limbs blown off by grenades, according to the publication. Children and babies are also among the captured. Hostage release a ‘PR exercise’ Professor Sally Totman from Charles Sturt University backed up the claim. She told news.com.au Hamas was “absolutely” only releasing healthy hostages. “You don’t want to release someone who is missing a leg or an arm as a result of their capture and being held,” she said. “You have to pick people who look reasonable to be released.” She described it as “all PR” by Hamas. Hostage conditions Speaking with reporters at Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv following her release from Hamas captivity, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz painted a surprisingly positive portrait of her captors in an extraordinary press conference. Ms Lifshitz is the only hostage so far to speak to reporters. But don’t be fooled. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

Some analysts suggest, given her comments, her press conference may have been part of the deal brokered with Hamas. Ms Lifshitz, a peace activist, declared that while she “went through hell” and was beaten on the day she was captured, she was treated “gently” and shown “care” over the two weeks she was held. She said a doctor was present and her captors “met all our needs” including for female hygiene. The diet she ate (cheese, cucumber and pita) was even the same as the captors, she noted. Hostage end game So what’s the purpose of this public relations exercise? Dr Ran Porat from the Australian Centre for Jewish Civilization at Monash University told news.com.au the terror group has three main goals. Firstly to reverse their image in western countries as the “Palestinian ISIS”. “Hamas is trying to undermine the countless, indisputable evidence … detailing the atrocious and vile acts of murder, rape, massacre of children, elderly and people with disability and how Hamas killers burnt down whole families, including babies that were beheaded,” he said. Secondly, the terror group hopes to pressure Israel to make concessions in a possible wider hostage release deal. “Hamas hopes that by slowly releasing hostages, one by one almost, the Israeli public opinion can pressure the government to cut a deal that would see the release of thousands of Palestinians, most of whom are terrorists convicted in a democratic court of law, in exchange for the hostages in Gaza,” he said. Most of all, Dr Porat speculated the terror group is hoping to delay a ground invasion which although deadly for all sides, will likely eradicate Hamas. The release of the US hostages could curry favour with the Biden administration. “Many of the hostages would either be killed during the fighting or be murdered by Hamas,” predicted Dr Porat. “Yet hopes for more hostage release deals constantly delay the attack.” Of course, nobody knows how the hostage situation will end. Analysts agree the situation is unprecedented. Previous hostage situations (such as the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange in 2011) have involved Israeli soldiers, not civilians. Prof Totman told news.com.au that hostage negotiations are a bit like “Chinese whispers” – what happens next is anyone’s guess.

Thousands flood streets as protests erupt,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/thousands-protest-across-sydney-and-melbourne-in-support-of-palestine-israel/news-story/cb312b23c1cbcbacb30e45f27dbfca5a,"Palestinian and Israeli supporters have congregated in their thousands in Sydney and Melbourne on Sunday after Tel Aviv declared the “second stage” of its war with Hamas, commencing a long-threatened ground offensive that took them into the Gaza Strip on Saturday. In Sydney, members of the Jewish community have organised a rally in solidarity with the people of Israel, bringing to attention the plight of the estimated 200 people, including 30 teenagers and young children and 20 people over the age of 60, who are being held hostage by militant group Hamas in Gaza. Organisers of the pro-Israeli “Bring them home” rally held in Martin Place on Sunday morning, arranged empty prams alongside empty shoes to represent the children and adults taken hostage. Protestors subsequently marched to Circular Quay, where the demonstration concluded with a song and prayer on the Museum of Contemporary Art’s eastern forecourt. Addressing the crowd, protest organiser Avi Efrat said the Australian Jewish community would not be cowed by the escalating conflict. “The reason we are doing [this] in the city is to give back confidence to the Jewish community in Australia and in Sydney,” he told the crowd. “Some of our community is scared to even go out. I have an answer to these people: not under this generation. This generation is a different generation. We will not be scared, we will come here and say what we have to say.” A similar pro-Israeli demonstration also occurred in Melbourne on Sunday, with protesters set to gather in Caulfield Park to call for the release of Israeli hostages. Separately, pro-Palestinian supporters have gathered outside Melbourne’s State Library for the third week in a row. Holding signs and waving flags, demonstrators chanted “free Palestine” and demanded an immediate ceasefire to safeguard the two million citizens ensnared in the Gaza strip. Speaking before the crowd, Australia Palestine Advocacy Network president Nasser Mashni, said history would “judge” this moment. “We’re taking receipts and we won’t forget it,” he said. Later on Sunday, thousands are anticipated to attend a rally in support of Palestine held in Sydney’s Hyde Park from 2pm on Sunday. Hosted by the Sydney arm of the Palestine Action Group, organisers expect to top attendance numbers for a protest it held last weekend. The group claimed some 30,000 people attended in opposition to the government’s support for Israel. “The Australian government continues to give full support to Israel's war crimes, even sending troops to the Middle East to act as Israel’s protector,” the rally’s organisers said in a statement on Facebook. “End the Australian government’s support for apartheid Israel and its war crimes against the Palestinians!” More than 1000 police officers are expected to be present at the demonstrations in Sydney to ensure the safety of protesters. The Australian government has supported Israel’s right to defend itself after the bloody incursion by Hamas in Israel that killed 1,400 people on October 7. In Gaza, the death toll has climbed to 7,650, according to the Palestinian health ministry, since Israeli air strikes began three weeks ago. Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton condemned the pro-Palestinian protests held earlier this month where some participants shouted anti-Semitic chants. Mr Dutton claimed similar events could rubbish Australia’s international standing. “Nobody wants to see a loss of life in the Middle East or anywhere else, nobody will tolerate discrimination against any Australian regardless of their religious faith or their background,” Mr Dutton said. “The scenes we saw at the Sydney Opera House, where people were cheering the slaughter of Israelis by Hamas terrorists, they're scenes that don’t belong in our country otherwise.” Speaking at a press conference in Tel Aviv on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “destroy the enemy above ground and below ground.” Warning that the war would be “long and hard”, Netanyahu reiterated his appeal for Palestinian civilians to evacuate to the south of the Gaza Strip, however air strikes have plunged the besieged enclave into communications blackout. ﻿“This is the second stage of the war whose goals are clear — to destroy Hamas’ governing and military capabilities and to bring the hostages home,” Netanyahu told reporters. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Israel’s ‘critical moment’ before all-out war,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-full-force-huge-retaliation-threatened-after-gaza-incursion/news-story/f9a22ab590d7f7e1084cdf74962687ea,"Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Israel’s president Benjamin Netanyahu has said its war with Hamas will be “long and difficult” but “we will win”. In a night time TV address, the PM also said the Israeli army was the “most moral in the world,” following comments from Turkey’s leader that Israel was a “war criminal”. Hamas has vowed to meet Israeli counter-attacks with “full force” after Israel’s military ramped up its air and ground attacks on Gaza. Israel had earlier made only brief sorties into Gaza during three weeks of bombardment to root out Hamas militants, who it said had killed 1400 Israelis, mostly civilians, on October 7. The armed wing of Hamas, the al-Qassam brigades, said its fighters were clashing with Israeli troops in Gaza’s north eastern town of Beit Hanoun and in the central area of Al-Bureij. “Al-Qassam Brigades and all Palestinian resistance forces are fully prepared to confront the aggression with full force and thwart the incursions,” it said. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, who reported live from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, described it as “the most difficult and bloodiest night since the beginning of this war” for Palestinians. Meanwhile efforts continue to free hostages, of which there are more than 200, and put in place at the very least a “humanitarian pause” to let aid supplies into the besieged strip of land. Read on for the latest updates. Israel is now in a ‘critical moment’ in Gaza crisis Images of the devastation in Gaza have fuelled anger in many countries. Now, tens of thousands of Israeli soldiers are waiting on the border for the toughest stage of a war that Netanyhu warned would be long and difficult. This showdown is Israel’s most perilous since the 1973 Arab-Israel war, when it was also taken by surprise, according to Jonathan Rynhold, a specialist on the Israel-Palestinian conflict at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. He said Israel will have to be ready for major casualties, which will be worse if Hezbollah turns its near-daily artillery exchanges with Israel into all-out conflict. Israeli troops have been given special training for urban warfare in the Palestinian territory’s narrow rubble-strewn streets and huge network of Hamas underground tunnels that they call the “Gaza metro”. “If Israel follows through on the stated aim of destroying Hamas military capabilities in the Gaza Strip and overthrowing its regime, then the scale and length of this war will be much bigger and much longer” than the four previous Gaza wars since 2005, the longest of which lasted seven weeks, said Rynhold. The expansion of ground of operations “will be the critical moment as to whether a second front opens with Hezbollah and that is a higher risk” than in previous wars, he added. ﻿- with AFP﻿ ‘A catastrophic failing the world must not tolerate’ The International Committee of the Red Cross has urged Israel to call off its ongoing bombardment of the Gaza Strip as the death toll continues to rise. “Two million civilians were trapped in Gaza with nowhere to flee amid massive bombardment and a military siege,” the ICRC said in a statement released on Saturday. The ICRC said the conflict was “catastrophic failing that the world must not tolerate”. “The absolute priority is the preservation of life, and that means allowing sustained deliveries of aid, and access for aid agencies,” the statement read. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has now updated the death toll since October 7 to over 8000. IDF commanders ‘deployed all over the Gaza Strip’ Benjamin Netanyahu says IDF commanders “are now in the Gaza Strip, they are deployed all over”. Israel’s primary goals are to eradicate Hamas from the region and release hostages still held captive by militants. Hamas’s armed wing said it was ready to release the hostages if Israel freed all the Palestinians held in its prisons. “The price to pay for the large number of enemy hostages in our hands is to empty the (Israeli) prisons of all Palestinian prisoners,” it said.“If the enemy wants to close this file of detainees in one go, we are ready for it. If it wants to do it step-by-step, we are ready for that too.” Facing increasing anger over the fate of the captives as Israel steps up its war on Hamas, Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed to meet representatives of hostage relatives. He made no commitment to any exchange deal but told the families authorities would “exhaust every option to bring (the hostages) home”. Gaza ‘disconnected from the planet’ An anonymous reporter in Gaza has revealed a snippet of life on the most dangerous streets on the planet, describing the city as “disconnected from the planet” as Israel’s assault continues. The BBC reported a short voice clip was sent through, with the reporter explaining how a communications blackout has added to the chaos in Gaza. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group, has reported a significant decline in connectivity in Gaza, leading to a virtual communication blackout. Civilians are now unable to contact their friends, family, or emergency services like ambulances to assist the injured. Palestinian Minister of Communications Ishaq Sider said they are is working around the clock on activating international roaming services in Gaza to patch up the communication crisis. The blackout has created even more confusion amongst Gaza’s population, with many still left in the dark about the fate of their missing loved ones. - with AFP ‘Long and difficult war’: Netanyahu In a TV address on Saturday night, local time, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu warned “this will be a long and difficult war.” He confirmed troops were in Gaza and said they had entered the “ that stronghold of evil”. This was Israel’s “second war of independence,” he continued, adding, “We will win. We will prevail.” “We will fight and we will not surrender. We will not withdraw. Overground and underground.” Mr Netanyahu also made remarks that appeared to be directed at Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who earlier on Saturday accused Israel of being a “war criminal”. “Don’t accuse us of war crimes. If you think that you can accuse our soldiers of war crimes that is hypocrisy. We are the most moral army in the world.” He insisted Israel was taking steps to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza and accused Hamas of using civilians has “human shields”. Hamas has said around 8000 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the conflict began, 40 per cent of who were children. ‘New phase of the war’ Israel’s defence minister Yoav Gallant said on Saturday, local time, that the country had progressed in its actions against Hamas. “We moved to a new phase in the war,” he said in a statement. “Tonight, the ground in Gaza shook. We attacked above ground and below ground. We attacked terrorist operatives at all levels, in all places. The instructions to our forces are clear: the operation will continue until a new order is given”. Most phone and internet connections were cut between Israel and Gaza as the new push took place, late on Friday. Israeli tanks and troops are now currently around Beit Hanoun, a community in the north of Gaza between Israel’s border and Gaza City itself. Israel Defence Forces chief of general staff Herzi Halevi confirmed on Saturday that Israeli forces were within the Gaza Strip. He added that the “best soldiers and commanders” were in Gaza and that it was continuing to “target and eliminate commanders of the Hamas terrorist organisation”. Northern Gaza now a ‘battlefield’ On Saturday, Israel dropped leaflets into northern Gaza warning the remaining residents to head to the south as the north of the territory was now a “battlefield”. Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari earlier said that it was an “urgent plea” to the citizens of northern Gaza and Gaza City to move. “The window to act is closing,” he said. Water turned back on in Gaza At the same time as Israel pummels Gaza it has also turned back on water supplies. Following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, Israel stopped all water entering the territory from three water pipes that linked it with Gaza. A key concern of the international community was the lack of water for Gaza residents It’s now been reported that two of the three water pipelines have been turned back on by Israel. Water should now be able to reach southern and central Gaza. But the Palestinian Water Authority says Israel’s bombardment and communications blackout may hamper efforts to restore water services to all. Turkish president calls Israel ‘war criminal’ The president of NATO ally Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has fronted a massive rally in Istanbul where he said he would declare Israel a “war criminal” following the Gaza “massacre”. “Israel, you are an occupier,” he told the Turkish and Palestinian flag waving sea of supporters. “Of course, every country has the right to defend itself. But where is the justice in this case? There is no justice -- just a vicious massacre happening in Gaza.” He also said the “main culprit behind the massacre unfolding in Gaza is the West”. Mr Erdogan added he does not consider Hamas as a terrorist organisation which is the classification many western nations, including Australia, have given the group. Turkey, which is officially secular, was the first Muslim majority country to recognise Israel back in 1949. But relations have in recent years been testy. Although, last year, Turkey and Israel restored diplomatic relations. Following the comments by Mr Erdogan, Israel said it would withdraw it diplomats from Ankara while it reassessed its relations with Turkey. Hamas massacre mastermind killed, says Israel The Head of Hamas’s aerial array, Issam Abu Rukbeh — who also helped organise the air assault into Israel — was killed overnight in an air strike, the IDF announced. “Abu Rakaba was responsible for Hamas’ UAVs, drones, paragliders, aerial detection and defence,” the IDF wrote in a post on X. The IDF claims Abu Rakaba oversaw the planning and execution of the attacks in Southern Israel earlier this month by directing the terrorists on hang gliders, as well as drone attacks on troops since Hamas’s invasion. ‘State of panic’: Israel escalates bombing The Israeli military said its fighter jets hit 150 “underground targets” in northern Gaza overnight as battles continued to rage on Saturday, local time. A military statement said the sites hit included “terror tunnels, underground combat spaces and additional underground infrastructure.” Its statement also said “several Hamas terrorists were killed” naming the head of Hamas’ aerial operations, Asem Abu Rakaba. The update comes after Israel warned it was “expanding operations” into the besieged area. On Saturday, a CNN team at an Israeli checkpoint near the Gaza Strip perimeter reported some of the explosions from artillery strikes in northern Gaza were so strong that the impact could be felt physically where they were, about a kilometre from the border. A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mark Regev, told CNN an “expansion” of ground operations in Gaza meant the army was “beefing up the pressure on Hamas.” He told the US-based network “that pressure will increase and continue to increase until we achieve our goal.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Horror festival video exposes painful truth,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/the-heartbreaking-stories-of-those-caught-in-the-crossfire-of-the-israelhamas-conflict/news-story/133fceaf0a648b17e3d98b363949f9c9,"On October 7, the world was left speechless when Hamas staged a surprise attack that kicked off the deadliest part in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. At the time of writing, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza claims that more than 7300 Palestinians have been killed in theIsraeli retaliatory strikes, with more than 18,900 wounded. Israeli authorities have claimed that more than 1400 people have been killed with more than 5400 injured since the Hamas attack. Countless lives have been lost, including aid workers, journalists and innocent civilians caught up in the crossfire. The past few weeks have been filled with heartbreaking stories from people within both the Israeli and Palestinian communities. News.com.au has spoken with people in Australia from both communities who have provided insight into the reality of the conflict and the impact it is having on their people and daily lives. ‘Bring Noa home’ For Israeli exchange student Evyatar Kopan, not knowing the fate of his close friendNoa Argamaniwho was kidnapped at the Supernova music festival has been torture. “I started following Hamas’ telegram channel because I knew that if anything bad happens to her, I could see it there. I didn’t even know what they were going to do but I am so worried, I just watch all the videos praying to God I wouldn’t see her face,” he said. At least 260 people were killed and countless others taken hostage when Hamas militants stormed the festival on October 7. Footage of Noa’s capture was widely shared in the wake of the attack, showing her screaming “don’t kill me” as she was grabbed by militants. She stretched her arms out towards her boyfriend Avi Natan as she was taken away on a motorbike. Later, footage showed her drinking from a water bottle in Gaza. Mr Kopan said he is constantly praying for his friend’s safe return. “I don’t see any footage [anymore]. They don’t release any video anymore. We can only assume what kind of hell that [the captives] are going through,” he said. “I’m praying and hoping that she’s alive. I just want to bring Noa home. All I want is for her to be safe.” ‘I often feel helpless’ Jonathan*, who was born in Israel but grew up in Australia, has tried to be strong for his mum who he says is “definitely struggling right now”. “The first couple of days [since the attack], I know my mum slept in front of the TV on the couch. She just didn’t want to miss anything … because of how raw it was and how close it was to home, how little information there was in the beginning,” he said. “Everyone is still on edge and trying to work out what’s happening.” ‘We suffer a lot of discrimination.’ As an Australian-Palestinian who often visits the West Bank, Ammar Abu Shamleh told news.com.au that Palestinians are often subjected to targeted discrimination. “As a Palestinian going into theWest Bank, even just at the border we suffer a lot of discrimination and abuse,” he said. “We’re put through really rough interrogations. We’re made to wait hours sitting at the border. We’re put through really invasive questioning in a way that is racially-profiled. People who go there and don’t have Palestinian names or looks don’t go through that. “A friend of mine who has an Australian passport and looks more caucasian in appearance doesn’t go through that and just walks straight through. Whereas myself — even the first time I went there, I get racially profiled and discriminated against.” Mr Abu Shamleh said many of the freedoms and liberties offered in Australia don’t exist for Palestinians living within the West Bank. “There’s no basic liberties and freedoms that we have here that we sort of take for granted. They [Palestinians] don’t have that and they’ve lived with that for over five decades now,” he said. “Even to just move around or for someone who wants to go and visit family in a city one hour away or move between towns, it’s all at the mercy of the Israeli military.” He said the West Bank has been “completely besieged” by Israeli forces since over the past few weeks since the start of this most recent conflict. ‘A lot of funerals’ Israeli exchange student Yotam Raz told news.com.au of his family’s heartbreak. “In Nahal Oz, in my family’s village, there are a lot of people [who have] died and a lot of people that we know in Gaza that are still absent and [we] don’t know what’s going on with them,” he said. “Because there are a lot of people [that have been] killed and the process of identification takes a lot of time to do, because there are a lot of bodies. So this is the reason why we still don’t know yet how many people are in Gaza, how many people have died. “At this moment, Israel has a lot of funerals because there are a lot of bodies. Every day we discover some new names and it’s really hard. It’s a really hard time for me as well.” ‘Every single day, waking up to news of more deaths’ For Jason Damouni it’s been a constant cycle of death, destruction and mourning the lives of those caught in the crossfire. “Last Sunday [October 22] we mourned the deaths of the Palestinian Christians that were bombed by Israel in the church, in Gaza,” he told news.com.au. “One of the survivors who has lost both of his legs, is now in critical condition,” he said, revealing the man’s daughter and wife were killed in the attack. Mr Damouni said losing so many loved ones has been devastating for him and the Palestinian community “Every single day has just been waking up to news of death, upon death of civilian life,” he said. “And being Palestinian here in Australia is extremely hard — especially in these last few escalations. We’ve had people calling for the deportation of people who attend the pro-Palestinian rallies. “People who are advocating or showing solidarity for Palestinians are seen as treacherous or terrorist sympathisers. The level of misinformation around this has made it very hard.” The suffering of two nations At the core of this conflict is the continuous suffering of people from two nations, says Western Sydney University (WSU) student Bakar Mohamad, which is something he believes is often forgotten. “There is [a] definite shared story between the Palestinians and the Jews and that is one of suffering, and it’s one of historic suffering,” the international relations student told news.com.au. “I think that shared identity gets taken away because of echo chambers, because of the partisan way that the issues are portrayed within a certain media scope.” Having studied the history of the conflict and created content to explain it to others, Mr Mohamad further broke down the pain and hardship both sides have endured. “From the Jewish perspective, it’s escaping millennia of persecution and cruelty. The Holocaust didn’t occur as an isolated event, Hitler was just an extension of what was already happening at the time,” he said. “On the other hand — there’s the Palestinian view point where they see it as, ‘We understand you’re suffering but what has that got to do with us and taking our lands?’ “There’s this idea that, ‘Sure, they’re suffering and should be granted a sovereign land and they should have peace. But why does that have to come at the expense of us? We’re just living peacefully in a land that was promised to us, that we fought with Britain for … we fought for this land’. “And once that shared history can be understood, that shared story of suffering … I think it’s one of those things that will allow us to move to our next step. Understand that we both suffer, so what do we do now?” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Hamas terror mastermind killed: Israel,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-army-says-it-will-intensify-gaza-strikes-very-significantly/news-story/921145de19c6fd1b1d71c3b9f10b1aee,"Hamas has vowed to meet Israeli counter-attacks with “full force” after Israel’s military ramped up its air and ground attacks on Gaza in what’s been described as the besieged territory’s “bloodiest night” since the start of the war. Israel had earlier made only brief sorties into Gaza during three weeks of bombardment to root out Hamas militants, who it said had killed 1400 Israelis, mostly civilians, on October 7. “The forces are still in the field and continuing the war,” Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a news briefing on Saturday morning. The armed wing of Hamas, the al-Qassam brigades, said its fighters were clashing with Israeli troops in Gaza’s northeastern town of Beit Hanoun and in the central area of Al-Bureij. “Al-Qassam Brigades and all Palestinian resistance forces are fully prepared to confront the aggression with full force and thwart the incursions,” it said. The increased fighting came amid heavy air bombardments which knocked out communications to create a near-blackout of information, largely cutting off the 2.3 million people in besieged Gaza from contact with the outside world. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, who reported live from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, described it as “the most difficult and bloodiest night since the beginning of this war” for Palestinians. Terror mastermind killed, says Israel The head of Hamas’s aerial array, Issam Abu Rukbeh — who also helped organise the air assault into Israel — was killed overnight in an air strike, the IDF announced. “Abu Rakaba was responsible for Hamas’ UAVs, drones, paragliders, aerial detection and defence,” the IDF wrote in a post on X. The IDF claims Abu Rakaba oversaw the planning and execution of the attacks in Southern Israel earlier this month by directing the terrorists on hang gliders, as well as drone attacks on troops since Hamas’s invasion. ‘State of panic’: Israel escalates bombing The Israeli military said its fighter jets hit 150 “underground targets” in northern Gaza overnight as battles continued to rage on Saturday, local time. A military statement said the sites hit included “terror tunnels, underground combat spaces and additional underground infrastructure.” Its statement also said “several Hamas terrorists were killed” naming the head of Hamas’ aerial operations, Asem Abu Rakaba. The update comes after Israel warned it was “expanding operations” into the besieged area. On Saturday, a CNN team at an Israeli checkpoint near the Gaza Strip perimeter reported some of the explosions from artillery strikes in northern Gaza were so strong that the impact could be felt physically where they were, about a kilometre from the border. A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mark Regev, told CNN an “expansion” of ground operations in Gaza meant the army was “beefing up the pressure on Hamas.” He told the US-based network “that pressure will increase and continue to increase until we achieve our goal.” BBC correspondent Rushdi Abualouf, who is in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said there was a “state of panic, fear and chaos” on Saturday as Israeli air strikes continued around the city, even though it is meant to be a safe southern part. He said with cell phone and internet services cut, Palestinians were cut off from the outside world and were also “unable to communicate with each other”. Extensive and intense bombing of the northern area of Gaza lit the night skies on Friday, local time, while internet services and phone networks were cut. Rockets were also fired from Gaza into Israel overnight. The Israeli military said one raid had killed Asem Abu Rakaba, who it said played a key role in the October 7 attacks that set off the current war. According to the Israeli military, Abu Rakaba oversaw Hamas drones, paragliders, aerial detection and aerial defence. “He directed the terrorists who infiltrated Israel on paragliders and was responsible for the drone attacks on IDF (Israel Defence Forces) posts,” said a statement. While the number of casualties are not yet known, the civil defence service in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory said the overnight air strikes had destroyed hundreds of buildings. “Hundreds of buildings and houses were completely destroyed and thousands of other homes were damaged,” spokesman for the Gaza Civil Defence, Mahmud Bassal, told AFP. He said the intense bombardments had “changed the landscape” of northern Gaza. The strikes left wide craters in the streets and flattened many buildings in the area. Continue reading for earlier updates. Israel launches ground incursion into Gaza Israeli troops and tanks are on the ground in Gaza as they expand their military operation. Its army has also begun an aerial bombardment — with strikes of “unprecedented” intensity hitting the region. “Our troops and tanks are inside the Gaza Strip. They’re shooting and they’re operating,” IDF Major Nir Dinar confirmed to theNew York Times. He added: “But our troops and tanks were inside Gaza yesterday as well.” Hamas’s armed wing the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said: “We are confronting an Israeli ground incursion in Beit Hanoun (in the northern Gaza Strip) and east Bureij (in the centre) and violent engagements are taking place on the ground.” The United Nations warned of a looming “unprecedented avalanche of human suffering” inside the Gaza Strip, while the General Assembly called for an “immediate humanitarian truce”. Australia didn’t vote for Gaza truce Australia’s representative to the United Nations has joined a global chorus calling for a ceasefire to the Israel-Gaza war butstopped short of backing a resolution. In New York on Friday, UN member nations overwhelmingly voted for a “sustained humanitarian truce” in the conflict to allow aid to reach Gazan civilians. The resolution, brought by Jordan, was backed by 120 countries, while 14 nations voted no and 45 – including Australia – abstained. Ambassador James Larsen said Australia agrees with the “central proposition” but could not back the resolution without condemning Hamas. Israeli Foreign Minister ‘rejects’ ceasefire Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen has taken to social media to “reject outright” the UN General Assembly’s overwhelming vote calling for a ceasefire in the Middle East. Mr Cohen called the vote “despicable” and vowed that Hamas would be crushed in a post to X, formerly Twitter. “Israel intends to eliminate Hamas just as the world dealt with the Nazis and ISIS,” he wrote. Israeli forces active in new location, unconfirmed Unconfirmed reports from Palestinian media say Israeli forces are active in the town of Zawata, near Nablus in the West Bank, The Australian reports. Other reports suggest forces are also engaged in Nablus itself. US Speaker talks with Israeli PM Newly-minted US House speaker Mike Johnson has spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express solidarity with his nation as it widens expands its ground operations in Gaza. “It was a privilege to speak this evening with my friend Netanyahu,” the Republican House leader said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday (AEDT) “The House of Representatives stands with Israel and I reaffirmed our strong support.” The update comes as Mr Johnson is set to grapple with the Biden administration’s request for $US106 billion in emergency funds for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the US border – as conservative Republicans seek to keep funding inside the US. Rallies against war around the world Demonstrations will continue to take place around Australia and the world to protest the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The Palestine Action Group will hold a “Stop the Genocide in Gaza” rally in the Sydney CBD on Sunday, the third gathering in as many weeks. Last week’speaceful demonstration through the cityattracted about 30,000 people, the group said on Facebook. Meanwhile, pro-Palestine protesters are also fathering in Perth, Melbourne, and Hobart. Meanwhile, a sit-in organised by Jewish Voice for Peace has shut down New York’s Grand Central terminal on Saturday (AEDT). Hundreds of supporters wore black shirts chanting “ceasefire now” and “let Gaza live” during the demonstration, according to reports. UN truce vote ‘will go down in infamy’, Israel says The UN general assembly has voted overwhelmingly for an “immediate, durable, and sustainable humanitarian truce” in the Middle East to deliver aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. A resolution drafted by Jordan received the support of 120 countries – the United States and Israel were among the 14 member nations that voted against it – that condemned all acts of violence aimed at Palestinian and Israeli civilians, including terrorism. It passed without an amendment from the US and Canada to specifically condemn Hamas and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages. Israel’s ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan condemned the vote for not singling out Hamas in the resolution. “Israel categorically rejects the General Assembly resolution passed this afternoon that does not even name Hamas — not once! As if this war started on its own!” Mr Erdan wrote on X. He said the decision would “go down in infamy” for not acknowledging the hostages held in the conflict. “Israel will continue to defend itself. Israel will do what must be done to eradicate Hamas’ capabilities and bring the hostages home.” IDF can’t guarantee journalists’ safety in Gaza The Israel Defence Force has said this week it can’t guarantee the safety of journalists in Gaza, after a request from the Reuters news agency and AFP that media not be targeted in the ongoing conflict. In response to the request, the IDF reportedly said Hamas was deliberately putting its military operations “in the vicinity of journalists and civilians”, according to Reuters. “The IDF is targeting all Hamas military activity throughout Gaza,” the IDF said in a letter to Reuters.“Under these circumstances, we cannot guarantee your employees’ safety, and strongly urge you to take all necessary measures for their safety.” The Committee to Protect Journalists says it has documented the deaths of at least 29 journalists since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel. Israel: ‘Tonight we are starting payback’ A senior adviser to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel is “beefing up the pressure” on Hamas as it escalates air strikes on Gaza. “Tonight we are starting payback,” Mark Regev said in an interview with MSNBC, per The Guardian. “When this is over, Gaza will be very different.” Mr Regev said Israel would continue its strikes until it had destroyed the Hamas “military machine” and dismantled its control of Gaza. He also addressed reports of a communications blackout across the Gaza Strip, and said such tactics had been “standard operational procedure” when other countries were involved in military operations. “If we want to hit targets in Gaza. we want to see that their command and control is disrupted, I think that’s good military logic.” ‘Moment of truth’ UN secretary-general Antonio Gueterres posted on X a short time ago to call for a ceasefire, saying “this is a moment of truth”. “I repeat my call for a humanitarian ceasefire in the Middle East, the unconditional release of all hostages, and the delivery of lifesaving supplies at the scale needed,” he said. “Everyone must assume their responsibilities. This is a moment of truth. History will judge us all.” It comes as a ground invasion of by Israel could be imminent after two days of overnight incursions by tanks into the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip. But around 200 hostages remain in the Palestinian territory with just four freed. Multiple nations, including the US, have pleaded for at the very least “humanitarian pauses” so the millions of Palestinians in Gaza can get access to food, water and international aid. Israel declared war after 1400 people were killed on October 7 by Hamas in a bloody cross border raid. Subsequent air strikes by Israel on Gaza are now said to have killed as many as 7000 Palestinians, although the numbers have been disputed. “We will continue to strike in Gaza City and around,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised address on Friday. “In recent hours we have increased the attacks in Gaza. The air force widely attacks underground targets and terrorist infrastructure, very significantly.” Internet, phones down: ‘Lost contact’ At around the same time as the Israeli military announced it was stepping up operations, communications went down on the Gaza Strip. The Palestine Red Crescent Society has said that it has “completely lost contact” with its staff. Israel has not commented on the communications outage. But the Hamas government said Israel “cut communications and most of the internet” across the Gaza Strip. The government’s media office accused Israel of taking the measure “to perpetrate massacres with bloody retaliatory strikes from the air, land and sea,” as heavy strikes hit northern Gaza. AFP journalists in Gaza confirmed they were only able to communicate in limited areas where they could connect to Israeli networks across the border. Palestinian telecoms provider Jawwal announced “the total cut of all communication services and internet” in the territory. “The heavy bombardment in the last hour destroyed all remaining international routes connecting Gaza to the outside world,” Jawwal wrote on its Facebook page. Global internet monitor NetBlocks reported “a collapse in connectivity in the Gaza Strip with high impact to Paltel,” Jawwal’s owner, citing live network data. “The company is the last remaining major operator to supply service as connectivity declines amid ongoing fighting with Israel,” NetBlocks wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Hamas command centre under hospital – Israel Israel has accused Hamas of housing its main command centre beneath Gaza City’s Al Shifa hospital. It is the biggest hospital in the territory. It said entrances to the infamous tunnel network lead from the hospital grounds but Hamas has denied the accusations. Earlier, US fighter jets carried out air strikes against two facilities in Syria. It follows a number of rocket attacks against US bases in the Middle East. The US has said Iran had a role in the attacks. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said the sites were used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and militias backed by Tehran. He added that the strikes were not directly connected to the situation in Israel and Gaza but rather were “narrowly tailored in self-defence”. “Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them,” he said. – with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

‘Unbelievable’ ancient find in Middle East,https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/archaeology/dig-in-iraq-uncovers-massive-2700yearold-winged-deity-sculpture-in-unbelievable-condition/news-story/fa781fa0570f052872471dad810ec557,"A dig in the Middle East has uncovered statue of a winged deity, which was almost entirely intact despite its size. The 2700-year-old alabaster statue depicting the winged Assyrian deity Lamassu was found in northern Iraq on October 24, AFP reports, in almost one piece. Only the head was missing from the massive sculpture, but that was already in the possession of the Iraq Museum in Baghdad after being confiscated from smugglers by customs officers in the 1990s. French archaeologist Pascal Butterlin, who led the dig, said he had “never unearthed anything this big in my life before”. The sculpture weighs 18 tonnes and measures 3.8 by 3.9 metres. “Normally, it’s only in Egypt or Cambodia that you find pieces this big,” he said, AFP reports. The statue was erected at the entrance to the ancient city of Khorsabad, some 15 kilometres north of the modern city of Mosul. It shows the Lamassu: an Assyrian deity with a human head, the body of a bull, and the wings of a bird. Mr Butterlin, who is a professor of Middle East archaeology at the University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne, said “the attention to detail is unbelievable”. He said the piece was commissioned during the reign of King Sargon II who ruled from 722 to 705BC and erected at the city’s gates to provide protection to the Assyrian capital. It was first mentioned in the 19th century by French archaeologist Victor Place, the relief – the sculptural method of raising the figure from a solid background – dropped from public records until the 1990s when Iraqi authorities earmarked it for “urgent intervention”. It was during this period that looters pillaged the head and chopped it into pieces to smuggle abroad. Professor Butterlin said the rest of the relied was spared destruction by the Islamic State jihadist group when it overran the area in 2014 because residents of the modern village of Khorsabad hid it before fleeing to government-held territory. – with AFP.

Israel leads insane new global backlash,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/the-revealing-backlash-against-un-chief-antonio-guterres-and-the-hypocrisy-it-exposes/news-story/64f042f25e5fc3430e77e607b66ea31e,"Comment The war between Israel and Hamas has awoken a hypocrisy in most of us, hasn’t it? A twisting of standards. A willingness to accept the unacceptable from our own side, so to speak, and condemn any hint of an indiscretion from the other. Selective outrage, selective empathy, selective morals, selective concern for civilian life. Selective humanity, really. And to that list you can add a depressingly common symptom of our current poisonous, polarised politics: selective hearing. This is the art of listening to someone of another political persuasion speak, seizing upon a small handful of words that sound vaguely incriminating, and then studiously ignoring all the surrounding context that would expose your fury as hollow. I hesitate to express too much sympathy for the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, who after all gets paid a perfectly comfortable-without-quite-being-embarrassingly-exorbitant salary tozip around the worldimpotently stating the obvious to people. Any job that involves bouncing between luxury hotels as frequently asTaylor Swift changes outfitsis hardly a prison of human suffering. And yet. This week Mr Guterres’ message was no less obvious, and no more objectionable, than his usual vanilla diplospeak: civilian deaths bad. Dead kids bad. As political material goes it had all the edge of a bouncy castle. But goodness me, did it make people angry. I’m going give you the quote that launched a thousand shouty TV panel segments. First in isolation, and then, after we’ve covered some of the reaction, in context. “It is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.” Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said this amounted to “justifying terrorism”, and called for Mr Guterres to resign. Its Foreign Minister, Eli Cohen, claimed the Secretary-General had “expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder”. Mr Cohen was “so upset” by Mr Guterres’ speech that he cancelled a scheduled meeting with him. The Israeli government announced it would refuse visas to UN representatives, such as the body’s Under-Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs, to “teach them a lesson”, which strikes me asMean Girls-level petty. “Antonio Guterres is a fugly slut. DO NOT TRUST HIM.” These are just the official channels of the Israeli government, never mind the hyperbole merchants of social media, who do rather tend to blur together. Now, here is the same remark in context. “I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented October 7 acts of terror by Hamas in Israel. “Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilian targets. All hostages must be treated humanely and released immediately, and without conditions. I respectfully note the presence among us of members of their families. “It is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing. “But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. Even war has rules.” You see the selective deafness, yes? We are to believe that Mr Guterres “justified terrorism”, in a speech that stressed “nothing can justify” terrorism, and said whatever grievances the Palestinian people have “cannot justify” Hamas’s atrocities. Even the supposedly offending paragraph, listing various examples of Palestinian misery, is not remotely inaccurate. Not a word of it. My email’s at the end of this article, readers – by all means, tell me where that paragraph is wrong. It’s not really a matter of accuracy, is it? It’s a matter of emphasis. Of the facts we choose to highlight and those awkward ones we prefer to ignore. Yes, the Palestinianshavebeen displaced, and encroached upon, and economically hamstrung. They’ve endured the bad faith of others for decades - not just Israel, but the duplicitous Arab states who pose as their allies. They have seen Israeli settlements spread and the Israeli government’s interest in a two-state solution dwindle. None of that excuses terrorism. It is not an attack on Israel, nor an expression of support for Hamas, to note the basic facts of the Palestinians’ suffering or the growing hopelessness they must feel. But it is not enough for the Israeli government, it seems, that we condemn Hamas and its barbaric methods. It’s not enough to oppose the killing of civilians, any civilians, without qualification. What’s demanded of us is a refusal to accept any nuance; fealty to the idea that Israel is 100 per cent in the right and the Palestinians 100 per cent in the wrong. Any expression of support or sympathy for the Palestinians who, whatever the crimes perpetrated in their name, have suffered countless indignities, is heresy. Forbidden. Worthy of a diplomat losing his job, or of a humanitarian mission being scuppered. It works in reverse as well. There are supporters of Palestinian rights who are wilfully blind to Hamas’s horrors, and consider any expression of solidarity with victimised Israeli civilians to be evidence of some vile moral rot. Who fail to notice the obvious evil standing over their shoulder in the mirror, glaring into their eyes. It’s so very, very tiring, and so often disingenuous. It is a paltry challenge, barely a challenge at all in fact, to acknowledge that innocents, victims, blameless people live on both sides; that the Israelis and Palestinians are all trapped in the same cycle of torment. The greatest cause for pessimism is, quite remarkably, not the decades of stalled diplomatic progress. It’s the stubborn refusal to see that the other side’s suffering also counts, and also matters – and that it’s OK to say so.

Israel’s ‘doll’ claim about dead boy,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/its-a-doll-death-of-4yo-palestinian-boy-falsely-denied-on-social-media/news-story/985c461d2c5dd6197ac2b30668f001f4,"The death of a Palestinian boy has been used to spread false claims online, after social media users, including the State of Israel, denied the boy had died and instead claimed he was a doll. Four-year-old Omar Bilal al-Banna was killed on October 11 following an Israeli air strike on Zeitoun, east of Gaza City. The young boy had been playing outside with his older brother when the strike hit their neighbour’s house, causing rubble to fall on Omar, theBBCconfirmed after watching footage where his brother described the attack. However, posts circulating on social media following the strike later claimed the four-year-old’s death was a lie. According to theBBC, a pro-Israeli account on X, shared a video of a man in a grey shirt holding Omar’s body, wrapped in a white blanket, and claimed the boy wasn’t a real person. “Hamas is desperate!” the caption read, adding the militant group had “released a video showing a dead Palestinian baby. But wait for the catch. It’s not a real baby; it’s a doll”. The post claimed the video “exposes how hard the lying and slanderous propaganda arm of Hamas and the Palestinians works”. The video, along with a still of the footage showing Omar’s face, was also shared by the State of Israel’s official account on X. “Hamas accidentally posted a video of a doll (yes a doll) suggesting that it was a part of casualties caused by an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] attack,” it wrote, according to theBBC. BBC disinformation and social media correspondent Marianna Spring said the false claims around Omar’s death, as well as another boy in a similar case, is “emblematic of how the information war is playing out right now on social media” amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. As part of an investigating into Omar’s death, Ms Spring confirmed the boy had died with a photographer who filmed the original video, as well as another photojournalist who was in Gaza at the time and took a photograph of the same man holding the same child, wrapped in the white sheet. “I chatted quite extensively to both of these photojournalists and they provided me with more details to corroborate the photo had been taken outside the morgue of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City,” she toldBBC’spodcastThe Conflict: Israel-Gaza. “They gave me infromaiton about the man in the t-shirt who turned out to be one of the relatives of Omar.” Ms Spring said one reason why people may have thought Omar was a doll, was the colour of his skin. However, one of the photojournalists told her several children killed in air strikes in Gaza had been photographed with similar pale skin. Ms Spring also confirmed Omar’s death with his mother, Yasmeen, who said lies about the “killing of children and innocent people are untrue and fake”. “They have no right to say he is a doll,” Yasmeen said. “They [the Israeli government] are lying and evading their crimes and massacres.” Disinformation battle amid Israel-Hamas war Ms Spring said the disinformation spreading in the weeks following Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel has become “more sinister”, often targeting individual cases. “Disinformation is at its most effective when it’s very emotive, when it makes us react,” she told the podcast. In a strikingly similar case, a four-year-old boy’s death in Israel has also been denied on social media. At the time of their death, Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, shared a post on social media, writing the entire family has been “murdered in cold blood”, alongside a photo of the family. “Look at their happy faces. Their love. All of them murdered by Palestinian terrorists at Nir-oz kibbutz. Just because they’re Jews,” he wrote. However, some people online denied the deaths, suggesting Omer was a “paid actor” because Hamas “didn’t kill kids”. A friend of the family, from Sydney, told theBBCthis kind of online disinformation was “evil and cruel”. “To deal with their death is hard enough, and all these comments make it even worse.” TheBBCsaid spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in the UK did not comment directly on the social media posts and instead accused the BBC of spreading misinformation.

Alarming Gaza picture proves one thing,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-fears-of-unimaginable-humanitarian-crisis-in-gaza-grow-further/news-story/7357a6b6ac332f75cb5aeba8150166f3,"Israel launched its second “targeted” nighttime raid into besieged Gaza as it prepares for a full-scale ground invasion. Columns of tanks backed by fighter jets, helicopters and drones smashed through border defences, wiping out Hamas terror targets and infrastructure, the IDF claimed. Israel has been bombarding the Palestinian territory since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping more than 220 others, according to Israeli officials. Read on for the latest updates. Israel ground forces raid central Gaza The Israel Defence Force released pictures of tanks rolling into Gaza for a second night in a row in a clear sign they are preparing for a full scale ground invasion. Israeli infantry backed by warplanes mounted an incursion deeper into Gaza on Friday. The hours-long raid took place near the Shuja’iyya neighborhood in the east of Gaza City as drones and combat helicopters swarmed overhead. Israel’s military said: “During the last day, IDF ground forces, accompanied by IDF fighter jets and UAVs, conducted an additional targeted raid in the central Gaza Strip. “The IDF identified and struck numerous terror targets, including anti-tank missile launch sites, military command and control centres, as well as Hamas terrorists,” it said. Black-and-white footage released by the military showed a column of armoured vehicles as a thick cloud of dust billowed into the sky after the strikes. Escalation as US carries out airstrikes US President Joe Biden sent a message to Iran warning against strikes on US troops, as the Pentagon confirmed the US military struck two facilities in Syria used by Iranian-backed militia groups. The US military struck two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Thursday. “The precision self-defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17,” he said in a statement. One US citizen contractor died from a cardiac incident during the attacks, and 21 US military personnel suffered “minor injuries, but all have since returned to duty”, Mr Austin added. The strikes in Syria follow a direct warning earlier on Thursday from President Joe Biden to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei against the strikes on US troops, the White House said. “There was a direct message relayed. That’s as far as I’m going to go,” US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters, declining to say how it was delivered. In his statement, Mr Austin sought to distance the strikes against facilities used by the IRGC in Syria from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. “These narrowly tailored strikes in self-defence were intended solely to protect and defend US personnel in Iraq and Syria,” he said. “They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict.” ‘Hell on earth’: Arab nations’ grim warning Representatives from Israel and Arab countries exchanged sharp accusations on Thursday at the UN General Assembly, as the body discussed the Israel-Hamas war following the Security Council’s failure to take action. The matter has exposed deep divisions in the Security Council, with a total of four resolutions gaining insufficient traction or being blocked by a veto in less than two weeks. Arab countries are hoping that the General Assembly, which has a different power balance and where no country holds a veto, will be able to act, even if any resolution would be nonbinding. But the back-and-forth on Thursday remained in attack mode, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, who spoke on behalf of 22 Arab countries, accusing Israel of “making Gaza a perpetual hell on Earth”. “The trauma will haunt generations to come,” he said, adding that “the right to self defence is not a license to kill with impunity … collective punishment is not self defence, it is a war crime”. The death toll in Gaza is expected to rise substantially if Israeli troops massed near the border move into the Palestinian territory. “To stop this madness, you have a chance to do something, to give an important signal. Choose justice, not vengeance,” said Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour. Jordan has circulated a draft resolution that is still under discussion, which is meant to be put to vote on Friday. The text focuses largely on the humanitarian situation, calling for an “immediate ceasefire” and “unhindered humanitarian access” to the Gaza Strip. It also calls on all parties to comply with the “protection of civilians”, but makes no mention of the Hamas attack. Israeli UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan blasted the text. “The drafters of the resolution claim to be concerned about peace,” he said. “Yet the depraved murderers who initiated this war are not even mentioned in the resolution. The only place this resolution belongs is in the dustbin of history.” ‘Harsh’: White House spokesman hits back White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby has angrily hit back at a reporter during a press briefing after she suggested President Joe Biden’s stance on Palestinian casualties was “harsh”. Mr Bidenon Wednesdaycast doubt on the figures produced by the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, saying he was “sure innocents have been killed, and it’s a price of waging war, but I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using”. “Don’t you think this is insensitive?” Brazilian journalist Raquel Krahenbuhl asked Mr Kirby on Thursday, noting there had been “very harsh criticism” of the comments by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which called on Mr Biden to apologise. Mr Kirby said there would be no apology. “What’s harsh — what’s harsh is the way Hamas is using people as human shields,” he said. “What’s harsh is taking a couple of hundred hostages and leaving families anxious, waiting and worrying to figure out where their loved ones are. What’s harsh, is dropping in on a music festival and slaughtering a bunch of young people just trying to enjoy an afternoon. “I could go on and on. That’s what’s harsh. That is what’s harsh and being honest about the fact that there have been civilian casualties and that there likely will be more is being honest because that’s what war is. “It’s brutal, it’s ugly, it’s messy. I’ve said that before. The President also said that yesterday. “That doesn’t mean we have to like it, and it doesn’t mean that we’re dismissing any one of those casualties — each and every one is a tragedy in its own right, and each and every one we should try to prevent. That is why we’re in close contact with our Israeli counterparts to do everything we can to help them minimise the risk to civilians that are in harm’s way. “It would be helpful if Hamas would let them leave. Leave their homes, leave areas, not shelter in tunnels underneath their houses and in hospitals, and let them get out, let them get out of Gaza if they want to leave. We know that there are thousands waiting to leave Gaza writ large and Hamas is preventing them from doing it. That is what is harsh.” Families say ‘patience has run out’ Families of some of the hostages held by Hamas have demanded the Israeli government act immediately, saying in a statement obtainedby CNNon Thursday that their “patience has run out”. “They have been there for 20 days, 20 days that we have no idea of their condition, if they are being cared for, if they are breathing, 20 days that we are asked to be patient,” Meirav Leshem Gonen, whose daughter Romi Gonen was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, said in the statement. “We have been extremely patient, but enough. Our patience has run out. All of us families of the hostages and the entire State of Israel that stands behind us say — enough! Our patience has ended.” Ditza Or, the mother of Avinatan Or, who was also kidnapped from the Nova music festival, said if the hostages were not returned Israel had “an existential problem”. “I call on all the rulers in this country — I do not call them leaders because they do not lead us,” she said. “This is not right or left-wing. If you do not bring them back, your place is in the garbage bin of history.” The statement came as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday promised a “supreme effort” to return the hostages. “I am determined to make every effort to return the hostages to their families, this is my supreme obligation, along with the effort for absolute victory in the war,” he told reporters. Local media on Thursday suggested Israel may be considering offering something in exchange to release a significant number of hostages, but the IDF has pushed back on a reported fuel-for-captives deal as Hamas “relies on fuel”. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged he would “have to give answers” for the intelligence failures that led to the worst terror attack in the country’s 75-year history. US forces attacked 16 times this month American and allied forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked at least 16 times this month, the US Defense Department said on Thursday, blaming “Iranian-backed militia groups”. The latest attack took place in the autonomous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq on Thursday, causing “no casualties” and “some minor damage to infrastructure”, Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told journalists. Since October 17, “US and coalition forces have been attacked at least 12 separate times in Iraq [and] four separate times in Syria,” Mr Ryder said, referring to the international coalition against the Islamic State jihadist group. The attacks were carried out with “a mix of one-way attack drones and rockets”, he said. “We know that these are Iranian-backed militia groups that are supported by Iran and of course we hold Iran responsible for these groups,” Mr Ryder said of who is behind the attacks. American forces in the Middle East are facing a spike in attacks linked to the latest war between Israel and Hamas. There are roughly 2500 American troops in Iraq and some 900 in Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of IS, which once held significant territory in both countries but was pushed back by local ground forces backed by international air strikes in a bloody multi-year conflict. Hamas says 50 hostages killed Approximately 50 hostages have been killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza, the spokesman for Hamas’ al-Qassam Brigades has claimed. “Al-Qassam Brigades estimates that the number of Zionist prisoners killed in the Gaza Strip as a result of Zionist bombing and massacres reached approximately 50 people,” Abu Obaida wrote in a statement on the group’s Telegram channel on Thursday. The claim has not been independently verified. Israeli authorities say Hamas kidnapped 224 hostages during the October 7 attacks on southern Israel that left 1400 dead, mainly civilians. Israel has retaliated with relentless strikes that Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry claims have killed more than 7000 people, also mainly civilians. Hamas has previously executed hostages as revenge for Israeli bombings, then claimed they died during the air strikes. The Palestinian terror group made a similar claim earlier this month, announcing Israeli air strikes had killed nine hostages, including four foreign nationals. At the time, Hamas wrote on Telegram that the hostages were killed “because of the Zionist bombardment on the areas they were staying in”, according toThe Jerusalem Post. Al Jazeerasubsequently reported those hostages had been executed by Hamas as revenge for attacks on its military buildings. Bachar Houli asked to remove video AFL great Bachar Houli was asked by senior figures in the sport to take down a controversial pro-Palestine video posted on social media,theHerald Sunreports. The video, originally posted by rugby player turned boxer Sonny Bill Williams, describes Israel’s actions in Gaza as “genocide” and says “don’t let biased media push you to support the oppressor”. Houli shared the video, but was requested by Richmond management to take it down. When the 35-year-old refused, the matter was then escalated to the AFL, according to theHerald Sun. AFL commissioner Paul Bassat spoke to Houli, as well as prominent Jewish community member and Richmond fan Paul Naphtali. The three-time premiership player deleted the video on Sunday and replaced it with a statement stressing he does “not condone killings of any innocent people regardless of their faith or culture”. Iran’s dark warning for US Iran, a nation that has bankrolled and is a major supporter of Hamas, has continued to make threats about Israel’s actions in Gaza. On Thursday at the United Nations in New York, Tehran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the US “will not be spared from the fire” if the “genocide” continues in Gaza. He was speaking at an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the conflict. “I say frankly to the American statesmen, who are now managing the genocide in Palestine, that we do not welcome [an] expansion of the war in the region,” said Mr Amir-Abdollahian. “But if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire.” Mr Amir-Abdollahian added that Iran was ready to act as an intermediary on the hostage situation alongside the roles played by Qatar and Turkey. The Foreign Minister continued that while Israel was pushing for the release of around 200 hostages in Gaza then around 6000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons should also be released. Why Israel hasn’t invaded yet Israel’s looming, much-discussed ground invasion has been anticipated for quite some time now. You might wonder what it’s waiting for — and here we might have an answer. The Wall Street Journalreports Israel has agreed totemporarily delayits invasion to give the United States time to move air defence systems in place, the point being to protect American troops in the region. The US is reportedly “rushing” to deploy about a dozen of these systems, and they could be in place by the end of the week. Senior Hamas leader visits Russia Russian state media reports a delegation representing Hamas is in Moscow. And Russia’s Foreign Minister says the Deputy Foreign Minister of Iran, Ali Baghiri Kani, is also in the city. Those two facts aren’t necessarily connected — but Russia has ties to both Iran and Hamas. Officially, the Putin regime’s position on the war in Israel is that a ceasefire should be declared, with the resumption of talks for a permanent peace deal. Diplomacy is a matter of emphasis though. Russia has blamed the current explosion of violence between Israel and Hamas on American foreign policy — a sign that it finds the whole situation quite useful. One member of the Hamas delegation is reportedlyAbu Marzuk, who’s among the terrorist group’s senior leaders. He is from Hamas’s political wing, not its military wing, but the entire group is considered a terrorist organisation by most major Western countries. Gaza Strip ‘becoming a graveyard’ Philippe Lazzarini is head of the UNRWA, the United Nations agency responsible for helping Palestinian refugees. He has written a piece forThe Guardianin whichhe warnsthat Gaza is becoming a “graveyard” and “hell on Earth”. “Entire neighbourhoods are being flattened over the heads of civilians in one of the most overcrowded spots on Earth,” Mr Lazzarini says. “The IDF has been warning Palestinians in Gaza to move to the southern part of the Strip as it bombs the north, but the strikes also continue in the south. There is nowhere safe in Gaza. “Gaza has been described over the last 15 years as a large open-air prison, with an air, sea and land blockade choking 2.2 million people within 365 square kilometres. Most young people have never left Gaza. Today, this prison is becoming the graveyard of a population trapped between war, siege and deprivation. “The generations to come will know that we watched this human tragedy unfold over social media and news channels. We will not be able to say we did not know. History will ask why the world did not have the courage to act decisively and stop this hell on Earth.” Warning of ‘explosion’ of refugees Israel has been accused of “politicising” the humanitarian aid it’s allowing into Gaza, and limiting it to such an extent that an “explosion” of refugees is becoming inevitable. Several dozen trucks carrying aid have been allowed into the Gaza Strip via its border with Egypt in recent days. Human rights advocates claim it’s nowhere near enough. “They are politicising the aid. They have put conditions on the type of aid that is allowed into Gaza. They are asking Palestinians to choose between water or food,” Tamer Qamout, a professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, toldAl Jazeera. “All these items are crucial. It is a crime, by all means. “They are also keeping the scale very low. They are building the momentum for a huge crisis. There will be an explosion. There will be hundreds of thousands of people, at some point, marching to Egypt if aid is not scaled up. “We are heading into a disaster.” Meanwhile the World Health Organisation has renewed its calls for “immediate and uninterrupted access into and across Gaza”, saying its “ailing health system” needs to be revived urgently. “Without fuel, medicines and health supplies, Gaza’s hospitals are on the precipice of an unimaginable humanitarian catastrophe,” it said. ‘Excruciating decision’ must be made The United Nations agency helping displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip says its supply of fuel, which it has been sharing, will run out today unless it makes an “excruciating” choice. The fuel has been used to help hospitals keep vital equipment, like life support machines and incubators, working. It’s also been used to power bakeries, ensuring people in shelters can be fed. But there isn’t enough fuel left to continue doing all of those things at once. “Do we give [it to] the incubators or the bakeries? It is an excruciating decision,” a spokeswoman, Tamara Alrifai, told the Associated Press. The World Health Organization says a third of Gaza’s hospitals have already stopped running. Israel conducts ‘targeted raid’ in Gaza The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has conducted a “targeted” night raid in northern Gaza, with tanks seen rolling into the area ahead of the “next stages” of conflict. “Overnight, the IDF conducted a targeted raid using tanks in the northern Gaza Strip, as part of preparations for the next stages of combat,” the army said in a statement on X. During the raid, the military said tanks and infantry struck a number of terrorist cells, infrastructure and antitank missile launch posts. Accompanying footage shows bulldozers and tanks driving into northern Gaza, before armoured vehicles fire at a number of targets. “The soldiers exited the area at the end of the activity,” the IDF said. ‘Genocide’: Law firm threatens PM The Prime Minister and federal government have been threatened with legal action by a Sydney-based law firm acting on behalf of Palestinian Australians. Birchgrove Legal has sent a letter of demand to Anthony Albanese saying the government “appears to have contravened domestic and international law” over its stance on Israel and warned it was considering whether comments made by senior ministers amounted to “complicity in genocide and other crimes”. The 32-page letter references public statements made by the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister Penny Wong, Defence Minister Richard Marles and Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil. It includes Mr Albanese’s October 10 statement that “we will stand with Israel, we always will”. The letter issues a series of demands to avoid legal action being taken, stating, “Immediate action must be taken to ensure that Australian government policy towards the unfolding catastrophe in Gaza complies with international law and places the core humanitarian principles of proportionality, distinction, precaution and humanity at its heart.” Birchgrove Legal solicitor Rita Jabri Markwell told radio station 3AW while it’s “within the right of Australian government ministers to stand with an ally” the line is crossed when the government is “standing with an ally that is acting outside the bonds of the rules of law”. “Under international criminal law if you know that another country is committing a crime, and you don’t say anything or you say just encouraging things and give moral support, that can have an encouraging effect on the person. And if they’re aware of your support, that brings you into the bounds of being complicit,” she said. “We’ve called for Albanese to issue a statement which acknowledges the breaches by Israel of international law, and … to take all means available to the Australian government to protect civilians in Gaza.” —with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
"Word lands MP, journo in hot water",https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/tony-burke-patricia-karvelas-blasted-by-jewish-australia-for-palestine-interview/news-story/12754674b238085f903c95691f5b8d7c,"The peak Australian Jewish body has criticised an ABC journalist and cabinet minister Tony Burke for “entertaining the notion” that Palestinians were subject to a genocide during a morning radio interview. The Employment and Workplace Relations Minister was asked by Radio National host Patricia Karvelas on Friday morning whether he considered the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza as an act of genocide. Mr Burke said he would “prefer to describe the facts” and leave it to listeners to “find their own words”. “I think when we go straight to ‘do we use this word, do we use that word’, we end up in an argument about linguistics. What I want to talk about is what’s happening to individuals,” he said. “The people who are going to be most affected by (Israel’s attacks), the people who will die first as a result of that, are not Hamas. They are families who live in Gaza. “Many of them live in Gaza already as refugees who are now refugees again because they’ve evacuated.” Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said the interview was a clear example of how “language matters and leadership matters”, adding that the council “expect better”. “Genocide isn’t a buzzword. It is the most heinous crime a nation can commit and involves the deliberate extermination of an ethnic group,” Mr Ryvchin said. “For a respected journalist to give the claim credibility and from a cabinet minister to have even entertained the notion is deeply irresponsible. “In any way likening Israel’s war with Hamas and mission to rescue its captives to that crime degrades the understanding of actual genocide and inflames passions locally.” An ABC spokesperson defended Karvelas for her “outstanding job covering this complex, unfolding situation”. “As part of a lengthy, detailed interview with Federal Minister Tony Burke, she put the use of the word “genocide” to him and asked for his thoughts on its usage,” the spokesperson said. “The usage of the word is being widely discussed, for example in a UN statement last week. She doesn't use the word herself.” Mr Ryvchin’s warning about risks to social cohesion comes as national security officials fear terrorist groups could take advantage of community tensions. Media at a briefing on Friday were told that the fallout from the war in the Middle East could pose threats to Australians in the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia and inspire domestic attacks. The terrorism threat level remains “possible”, but officials are said to be on guard given the risk of sporadic violence inspired by the war. It’s understood officials are not concerned about any attacks being planned. National security officials are also understood to be concerned about the risk of escalating violence in the Middle East, with diplomatic efforts concentrated around preventing Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the war. Officials warn that would be more likely should Israel carry through with their threat of a ground incursion. Jewish journalist and political activist Theodor Herzl - considered the father of the modern Zionist movement - founds the World Zionist Organisation in 1897. The aim of the organisation is to establish a national home for the Jewish people secured by public law. Earlier, Mr Burke also threw his support behind the Canterbury-Bankstown council – which is in his electorate – over its decision to raise the Palestinian flag until a ceasefire was declared. “It’s a flag that gives people the chance to know that there is recognition and not selective grief,” he said. “We can’t say we only grieve for certain people who are slaughtered. We can’t have a situation as a nation where we only formally acknowledge particular deaths.” There are a number of Australians trapped in Gaza. It’s understood Australian agencies are in near daily contact with most of those people. A landmark green energy scheme to keep the lights on as ageing coal fired power generation exits the grid has been unveiled, but the government reveal how much the scheme will cost. Labor has been slammed for being “out of date” on nuclear energy and having an “obsession” with renewables, just days away from a major climate conference in the Middle East. A major change is coming for dual citizens convicted of terrorism with the government vowing to fix “broken” laws.",
‘Barbaric’: Israeli soldier’s shock at Hamas act,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/barbaric-exisraeli-soldiers-shock-over-vile-hamas-acts/news-story/baf14427e4f04b5dec706017b86f9b9f,"An ex-Israeli soldier has expressed his shock over the vile acts committed by Hamas fighters in an escalating conflict he’s labelled “worse than the Holocaust”. Sydneysider, Avi – who didn’t want his full name to be published – spent four years in the Israeli special forces. He condemned the atrocities committed by militants, who have reportedly defiled bodies in the weeks since their October 7 attack on Israel. Speaking to news.com.au, the 41-year-old said he never would have been ordered to carry out such horrific acts during his time in the army. “Would I have gotten an instruction to go house by house and kill people and cut bodies? Never, not in the worst dream,” he said. “There is a big, big difference in the barbaric way [things have] happened … They are going house by house, shooting families, shooting kids. The way they treat the bodies … It’s worse than the Holocaust.” He said the conflict, including the deaths of 1400 Israelis and the abduction of 200 people, is one that will never be forgotten. “You hear stories, real stories [about the Holocaust] but it’s actually happening now,” he said. “This is what your kids are going to read about it.” More than 6500 Palestinians, mainly civilians, have been killed across Gaza in relentless Israeli bombardments in retaliation for the attacks by the Palestinian Islamist militant group, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Avi’s comments came after Israel’s government showed a 43-minute clip of killings and mutilations committed by Hamas in a private screening for hundreds of foreign journalists earlier this week. In one shocking clip, Hamas militants were seen lobbing a grenade into a home bomb shelter, killing a father inside, while another showed a militant attempting to use a garden hoe to try to decapitate a man. The footage, which was captured by security and body cameras worn by fighters, also showed fighters shooting civilians on the road and a man being executed in a living room chair through his screen door. As the war rages on, Avi said witnessing the aftermath of horrific acts carried out by Hamas will only make Israeli soldiers “stronger”. “Soldiers over there, they feel that another 9/11 happened in Israel,” he said. “It makes them understand that the protection of Israel is very, very important.” After serving in the army from the ages of 19 to 23 and witnessing people being killed and injured, Avi’s military days are long behind him. He’s now a business owner in Sydney, where he lives with his three children and wife, who he met when he moved to Australia in 2004. Like others in the Israel-Australia community, watching the war unfold back home has left the 41-year-old “devastated” and worried for his family members overseas. “My friends have lost brothers and sisters … I know one guy that left his wife in a safe room went to grab weapons and they kidnapped his wife and three kids,” he recalled. Given his military background, Avi requested to return home and join the war effort but he was told he was “not trained and too old already”. “When you’re not in the army, and you’re not trained for so many years, they are not interested,” he said. “And there are so many volunteers because it was such a big shock to the community that everybody wants to go and help to protect Israel.” Instead, he is focusing efforts on the ground in Sydney, where he has distributed 10,000 ‘kidnapped’ posters of 78 people who have been taken hostage in Israel. The posters, which have been plastered in bus and train stations among other locations around the city, match other posters distributed in cities around the world. “Some people don’t read the news, because people are busy with life, and unfortunately people forget very fast,” he said. “I want to educate people and bring awareness that 1400 people have been killed. I want people to stop and ask questions and to open a conversation.” Avi said he is undeterred by posters taken down in other cities, including in New York where students were caught tearing down posters outside a business school. “If they tear it down, it’s OK. We will put it back up again to bring awareness.” He is also urging the Australian government to continue to push for the release of more than 200 hostages in Hamas, four of which have been freed in the last week. “There are civilians, and they are innocent,” he said. “There is no room for radical groups in modern society around the world.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Flag man’s attempt to escape media,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/courts-law/man-attempts-to-avoid-media-in-first-court-appearance-over-alleged-antiisraeli-act/news-story/7c7244fc577982b277bcea9a6ab0cb04,"A man accused of an anti-Israeli incident where he allegedly threatened to kill four teenagers attempted to evade media by not coming into court as his lawyer entered pleas to the charges. Abdullah Al-Taay is accused of verbally threatening four teenagers on Bellevue Rd at Bellevue Hill in Sydney’s east on October 9 after the teens tried to display an Israeli flag on their car. A video of the incident emerged online, appearing to show Mr Al-Taay telling the group to “put that thing back” before allegedly threatening them. “I swear if I f**king see youse with that flag I’ll f**king kill youse all,” he allegedly says in the video. “I’m telling youse right now – all of youse,” he allegedly added before retreating from the car. Mr Al-Taay was then charged with four counts of stalk/intimidate intending to cause fear or physical harm, “one for each of the (alleged) victims”, according to Detective Superintendent Jodie Radmore. He was charged on October 11 and spent one night in custody before he was released on bail following an application to a magistrate at Downing Centre Local Court the following day. He was due to face the same court on Friday to enter pleas to the charges, but his lawyer Aqib Javed told a deputy registrar that Mr Al-Taay was “present in the vicinity” of the Downing Centre Court but was “not inside due to media coverage and controversial issues”. “For that reason he is not making an appearance … he is downstairs, if I could just indicate,” Mr Javed told the court. He told the court that his client was “reluctant” to make an appearance due to the media presence outside court and “kindly” requested the court proceed without Mr Al-Taay present due to the “controversy”. The registrar asked Mr Javed to bring his client to court as he didn’t have “any order to be excused”. Minutes later, Mr Al-Taay walked into the courtroom as Mr Javed formally entered pleas of not guilty to all four charges. Mr Al-Taay did not answer questions outside court from a large media scrum but pulled out his phone and filmed as he walked away. In the days following the incident, Superintendent Radmore told the media the group of teenagers were fixing the Israeli flag to their car before heading to a vigil to commemorate the lives lost in the first attack by Hamas on Israel earlier this month.

He is also banned from attending any protest or rally and must abide by an 8pm to 6am curfew. The matter will return to court on December 15.

‘War crimes’: Senator rages over Israel,https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/penny-wong-joins-calls-for-gaza-humanitarian-pause-for-aid/news-story/9723608b0f9ad672e3a298af344b2f57,"Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has criticised the government and opposition for failing to condemn Israel for “committing war crimes” against Palestinians in Gaza. The deputy Greens leader said the situation was worsening every day, and that Israel was inflicting collective punishment against Palestinians. “I think people are horrified, and I think it is completely untenable and disgraceful the Australian government do not come out and call it what it is – collective punishment and war crimes,” she said. For weeks, the government and the opposition have voiced their support for Israel to defend itself after Hamas launched its deadly attacks on October 7. But on Thursday Senator Faruqi said “committing war crimes is not defending yourself”. “Throwing bombs of white phosphorus is not defending yourself, denying 2.3 million people of food, water, electricity, fuel is not defending yourself. Let’s call it for what it is … this is not self-defence … this is collective punishment, and is absolutely a war crime,” she said. So far, Labor MPs Ed Husic and Anne Aly have been the only government members to voice their concern over innocent Palestinians. Senator Faruqi said she hoped more MPs came out. “But what is more important is that the prime minister and the minister for foreign affairs actually call it what it is,” she said. The Coalition’s foreign affairs spokesman Simon Birmingham was asked whether Israel cutting off food, water, and energy, and blocking aid envoys into Gaza was an “appropriate response”. Senator Birmingham said there was a lot of “disinformation” circling. We give, again, all support to parties to work with Egypt and others to try to get those foreign nationals out, get the humanitarian assistance in and critically, those people who should be able to get out of Gaza are the hostages who we should not forget are still being held by Hamas and along with the Palestinian people in general are being used as a human shield by the terrorists,” he told ABC News. He said Israel was acting to “remove Hamas from a position of influence”. “That is an appropriate response, they should act in accordance with international laws and they should be absolutely mindful in terms of civilian lives lost … but this is a very challenging, very difficult situation that Israel finds itself in to attempt to remove a terrorist power acting on its doorstep,” he said. Senator clashes with Wong Earlier in foreign affairs estimates on Thursday, Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong stopped short of saying the suffering in Gaza amounted to collective punishment when asked during a fiery exchange with a Greens senator. Greens senator Jordon Steele-John asked whether the government would condemn the “siege of Gaza” as a “crime of collective punishment”. Senator Wong acknowledged the “terrible suffering” of civilians in the Gaza Strip but declined to adopt Senator Steele-John’s characterisation. “This is precisely why the government has called for a humanitarian pause, along with others, to find the space to enable the convoys we’ve talked about already, to get assistance to innocent civilians in Gaza,” she said. Senator Wong said “this is an extraordinarily difficult, complex and distressing crisis”. But Australia believed in “Israel’s inherent right to exist and … right to defend itself”. “There is clearly widespread suffering in Gaza, there clearly is. And we know that Hamas, which is a terrorist organisation, has burrowed itself into Gaza’s civilian population, so none of this is easy. This is all tragically difficult,” she said. Senator Steele-John pushed back: “It is a complete siege, a textbook definition of collective punishment … Why won’t your government condemn this crime against humanity.” “They are your words – I will use my words and I have responded,” Senator Wong responded. DFATs acting chief counsel Marie-Charlotte McKenna told the committee that “sieges are not in themselves prohibited under international humanitarian law”. Thousands of Aussies in Lebanon Australians have been warned to leave Lebanon amid fears the Israel-Hamas conflict could spiral into a wider regional conflict. About 15,000 Australians are in Lebanon but less than 400 people have registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, officials confirmed on Thursday. “Our travel advice is do not travel to Lebanon due to the volatile situation,” Senator Wong said. “If you are an Australian in Lebanon, you should consider leaving on the first available commercial departure option if it is safe to do so.” But department officials raised concern that their message was not being heeded. “I think we have every indication that it’s not,” deputy secretary Craig Maclachlan said. “We are not alone in that experience either. We are obviously co-ordinating our efforts with like-mindeds and other partners. “We have, as the minister outlined, increased our messaging … but frankly the levels of calls that we receive in relation to Lebanon have diminished to very low numbers.” He cited Australians’ long-term connections with family and friends in the country and said people might not be leaving because they hoped a diplomatic solution might be found. “We don’t have the luxury in the sense of relying on hope. We are trying to, we are doing everything we can to plan for a future crisis,” Mr Maclachlan said. “We can’t be certain, despite all of the planning that is under way now, that we will be able to exercise those plans because we cannot know at this point what the nature of the security environment will be like at that time.” In 2006, the Australian government evacuated more than 5000 Australians from Lebanon when war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah. Mr Maclachlan said the 2006 evacuation was “seared” into consular officials minds. On Tuesday, Israel’s ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, said his country was prepared for war in Lebanon if provoked by the militant group Hezbollah. “We do not have any desire or interest to open another front but, if forced to, Israel is ready. We will not be surprised again,” Mr Maimon told the National Press Club. The Hezbollah leader met with senior Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad leaders to discuss “an all out victory” over Israel, according to a Hezbollah statement. Additional $15m in aid to be given to Gaza Meanwhile, the federal government’s announcement of an additional $15m in aid to civilians in Gaza has brought the total package of humanitarian assistance to $25m. Senator Wong said the funding would be delivered “through trusted partners to help address immediate and emerging needs including food, water, medicine and other essential services”. The first-aid package, department officials said, provided through the International Committee of the Red Cross, helped with the provision of beds and medical supplies including stretchers and body bags. “They were able to also support the installation of 25 water storage tanks within Gaza,” Humanitarian division’s first assistant secretary Beth Delaney said. More than 5000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes since Hamas’s attack on Israeli civilians on October 7 killed at least 1400 people. After the Hamas attack, Israel cut off access to water, food and electricity to Gaza. Several aid trucks have crossed from Egypt to Gaza in recent days but the Foreign Minister said the access was “nowhere near enough”. “We call for humanitarian pauses on hostilities. So food, water, medicine and other essential assistance can reach people in desperate need, and so civilians can get to safety,” she said. Prior to the crisis, 400 trucks a day were allowed to pass over the border between Egypt and Gaza, department officials confirmed. She reiterated her position that Australian wanted “an enduring peace in the Middle East grounded in a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can live securely behind internationally recognised borders”. The Foreign Minister said Australia “stands with Israel” and recognised its inherent right to defend itself but insisted “the way Israel exercises its right to defend itself matters”. “It matters to civilians throughout the region, and it matters to Israel’s ongoing security. Innocent Palestinian civilians should not suffer because of the outrages perpetrated by Hamas.” The government has assisted more than 600 Australians and 242 foreign nationals leave Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories through eight flights. Another 79 people are trapped in Gaza and have been unable to leave, while 51 Australian citizens remain in the West Bank. “We are deeply distressed that international efforts to secure civilian passage out of Gaza, efforts Australia has engaged in and is actively supporting, are yet to be successful,” Senator Wong said. The Greens leader has issued a warning to the major political parties as he joins a blockade at a major port to demonstrate for environmental change. Holland’s hard-right new leader Geert Wilder’s victory has exposed an issue that Australia needs to learn from. A minister’s office has been vandalised for the second time in as many weeks amid growing tensions within the community over the Israel-Hamas conflict.",
Deputy Mayor ’untenable’ after Hamas stance,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/politics/waverley-council-deputy-mayor-likely-to-be-removed-following-hamas-stance/news-story/bdda9e3490db9dd1561a55646c6427cb,"The deputy mayor of a Sydney council with a large Jewish population has been voted out of the position after he refused to back a motion condemning the Hamas attacks on Israel. Waverley Council held an extraordinary council meeting on Thursday night to vote on a motion to remove Greens councillor Ludovico Fabiano as the deputy mayor. The meeting was at times highly emotional, with Mayor Paula Masselos-Mayor threatening several times to kick out people in the gallery who were making loud interjections. Mover of the motion to eject Mr Fabiano, Liberal Councillor Will Nemesh said it was untenable for Mr Fabiano to continue as deputy mayor. “He should have done the honourable thing and resigned, barring that, which he hasn’t. council will now endeavour to remove him as deputy mayor,” he added. Mr Fabiano had voted against a motion after the October 7 attacks that condemned Hamas, expressed “sympathy and condolences” to the families and friends of the dead and injured, and acknowledged the loss of civilian lives in Israel and Gaza “as a direct consequence of Hamas’s terrorist attack”. Mr Nemesh rejected Mr Fabiano’s claims the council had politicised the issue. Mr Nemesh also said Mr Fabiano had amended the original motion to also acknowledge “the war crimes perpetrated by a right-wing Israeli government”. “If anyone’s politicised it, he has. The amendments he did was about the Middle East and Middle Eastern politics,” Mr Nemesh, who also follows the Jewish faith. said. “What he said is really quite disgraceful and I think goes to the heart as to why he should have resigned.” Mr Fabiano will remain as a councillor. The deputy mayor role is elected by councillors for a period of one year. In a statement issued by Mr Fabiano on Wednesday night before the meeting, the 13-year councillor said he was “surprised and deeply disappointed”. “It has been a great honour and privilege to serve the wonderful people of the Waverley Council area as their Deputy Mayor,” he said. “It is an amazing community – diverse, inclusive and a community that I believe cares deeply about each other and the many complex issues that face communities around Australia.” He said he would continue to “condemn the killing of Palestinian civilians by the Israeli military”. “With this tragic conflict in Gaza and Israel, this is not the time for politicians to seek political mileage from this conflict on the other side of the planet.” NSW Council for Civil Liberties (NSWCCL) president Lydia Shelly called on the motion “undemocratic”. She said Mr Fabiano and Mr Kanak’s comments were “non controversial,” and reflected the views held by many Australians. “If our society is serious about protecting and defending human rights, no one should be subjected to oppressive conduct for speaking in support of human rights, regardless of whether that is at home or abroad,” she said. “This motion signifies a very concerning slide towards silencing those whose views may not conform with those who wield political power. There is no place in Australia for this to be normalised.” Mr Fabiano also said he and Mr Kanak had since received “offensive and deeply unsettling” social media posts and emails. “Some of the emails have used threatening language. One email has been referred to the police,” he said. “We have been shocked at the online attacks and hate speech we have received. Most people would be.” Protesters dressed in hazmat suits were kicked out of the NSW Liberal Party conference for calling Opposition Leader Peter Dutton the “MP for Fukushima”. A former Liberal candidate who nearly ousted now NSW Premier Chris Minns from his seat, has been endorsed as the candidate to win back John Howard’s old seat. One of the victims of a pedophile former state MP says he “never got back on track” after being sexually abused as a boy.",
Deputy mayor faces sack over Hamas stance,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/politics/ludovico-fabiano-breaks-silence-after-he-was-dumped-as-waverley-councils-deputy-mayor-over-hamas-motion/news-story/a98e8d6d73e44902524c842262947e07,"The deputy mayor of a Sydney council has said he is “surprised and deeply disappointed” after his colleagues moved to oust him from his role for voting against a motion condemning the Hamas attacks in Israel. Councillors at Waverley Council in Sydney’s east will gather for an extraordinary council meeting where they will call to remove Ludovico Fabiano as the Deputy Mayor. This comes after Mr Fabiano, and his fellow councillor Dominic Wy Kanak, voted against a motion condemning the Hamas attacks on Israel. The motion also expressed “sympathy and condolences” to the families and friends of the dead and injured, and acknowledged the civilian lives in Israel and Gaza “as a direct consequence of Hamas’s terrorist attack”. Mr Fabiano and Mr Kanak also attempted to amend to motion to acknowledge “the war crimes perpetrated by a right-wing Israeli government, including the bombing of Palestinian civilians,” and called “for all perpetrators to be held accountable,” however they were voted down. In a statement released on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Fabiano said he was “surprised and deeply disappointed” at the plans. “With this tragic conflict in Gaza and Israel, this is not the time for politicians to seek political mileage from this conflict on the other side of the planet,” he said. “I have, and will continue to, condemn the attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians. “I have, and will continue to, condemn the killing of Palestinian civilians by the Israeli military.” Mr Fabiano said he had spoken “extensively” about his “commitment to the wellbeing of our local Jewish community,” and said he “personally believed” the amendments to the motion “responded to the tragic events overseas”. “At last week’s meeting of Waverley Council the Liberals and Labor jointly put forward a one-sided motion on the events in Israel and the crisis in Gaza. The Greens councillors’ attempts to have input to the draft motion prior to the meeting were ignored,” he said. The deputy mayor said he has also received several “offensive and deeply unsettling emails and social media posts,” since voting against the motion, one of which has been referred to the police. “Some of the emails have used threatening language,” the statement said. “We have been shocked at the online attacks and hate speech we have received. Most people would be.” Condemning the messages, Mr Fabiano said the behaviour did nothing to help his “hurting” community. “This has taken a heavy toll on me and my family. A healthy democracy is not one where people feel at risk for doing their job,” he said. “These attacks on me, seemingly for some sort of political power grab at our local Council are a complete distraction from the need for healing and understanding of each other’s viewpoints.” According to agenda notes released for Thursday night’s meeting, Mr Fabiano and Mr Kanak could also be removed from several committees. These include the Access and Inclusion Advisory Panel, Reconciliation Action Plan Advisory Committee, and Multicultural Advisory Committee. If the motion succeeds, it would declare the position of Deputy Mayor as vacant.

‘Back to the Stone Age’: Chilling new threat,https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/back-to-the-stone-age-chilling-new-threat-in-israelhamas-conflict-could-bring-the-whole-region-to-its-knees/news-story/265b44a0ac4625ada1784d2ce33ba624,"A chilling new element in the Israel-Palestine conflict could bring the entire region to its knees, spark all-out war and force the involvement of the United States, experts warn. The Israeli Defence Force says it’spreparing an imminent ground offensivein Palestine after days of air strikes on the crippled region. While its mission is to rid Gaza of Hamas’ leaders, the military action has caused asignificant loss of life, including many civilians, and sparked outrage across the Middle East. In neighbouring Lebanon, the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has vowed to go to war if Israeli troops are to enter Gaza. Experts say that would spark disaster for the Lebanese people and inevitably have broader and deadly ramifications for the entire region. Hezbollah has beengearing up for actionfrom the moment Israel launched retaliations against Hamas for the terror attacks on October 7. Rockets fired from inside Lebanon have killed dozens and forced the evacuation of Israeli locals. But Nicholas Blanford, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tankAtlantic Council, said that’s just a small preview of what could be to come. Lebanon’s involvement in the Israel-Hamas conflict “could trigger a full regional war” that leaves the West with no choice but to become involved, he warned. “With the unprecedented and deadly Hamas assault on Israel and Israel’s punishing response on Gaza, the Arab-Israeli conflict has entered uncharted, unpredictable and extremely dangerous waters,” he said. “The coming days will determine whether the region heads to a full-scale war.” ‘Unification of the fronts’ Hezbollah has in the past spoken of its so-called “unification of the fronts” military strategy, which defence analysts say would involve an Iran-sponsored formation surrounding Israel. Mr Blanford said it could see a “closer co-ordination between anti-Israel groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, along with myriad other Iran-backed groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen”. An Israeli ground offensive in Gaza would be the trigger for such a dire reality unfolding, Michael Young, the senior editor at the Malcolm H Kerr Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut, predicted. “Hezbollah’s priority would be to open a second (and maybe a third and fourth) front against Israel to halt the Israelis’ momentum,” Mr Youngwrote forThe National. “In doing so, it would bring in armed militias from Iraq and perhaps Yemen to bolster its forces, which could widen the scope of operations. “Once that happens, it would mean a radical intensification of the conflict and the very real prospect that it mutates into a regional war. Under those circumstances, Israel’s military actions may come to encompass Iran, which could draw in the US, leading to an extremely dangerous situation globally.” Realistically, neither Hezbollah nor Israel really wants a war, Mr Blanford said, knowing that the consequences would be serious. However, an escalation of tensions could see individual clashes evolve into several days of sustained fighting, and that scenario would raise the “risk of miscalculation”. “In such a scenario, Hezbollah’s Radwan Brigade might mount its own cross-border raids – it has been training for such operations since at least 2007,” said Mr Blandford. “In response, Israel might launch air strikes on Lebanese infrastructure targets and stage limited armoured incursions across the Blue Line.” The Blue Line is a term the United Nations uses to describe the demarcation between Lebanon and Israel. “After, say, five days of fighting, Hezbollah’s military commanders might assess that Israel is on the brink of launching a major pre-emptive strike against the organisation’s arsenal of long-range precision-guided missiles,” Mr Blanford added. “They might then recommend to the group’s leadership that a mass missile attack must be launched against targets across Israel before the weapons can be destroyed, a case of ‘use them or lose them’. “Such a move would guarantee all-out war. By the same token, the Israelis might conclude that, after five days of fighting, Hezbollah is about to launch its missiles toward Israeli cities and that Israel must launch a pre-emptive strike, thus guaranteeing a full war that neither side had sought.” ‘Back to the Stone Age’ Should Hezbollah become involved in the Israel-Hamas conflict, Tel Aviv has vowed to respond in such a way that it sends Lebanon “back to the Stone Age”. That was the warning from Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in a video message, in which he vowed to “use all our power [to] erode every inch of Hezbollah and Lebanon if we have to”. “If an escalation or conflict develops here, we will return Lebanon to the Stone Age. Don’t mistake us, we don’t want war, but we are ready to protect our citizens, our soldiers and our sovereignty.” Hezbollah’s chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah quickly responded, saying Israel “will also go back to the Stone Age”. Nasrallah said it would only take “a few high-precision missiles” to decimate targets in Israel – seemingly a chilling reference to its support from Iran. The US State Department acknowledges that Tehran provides most of Hezbollah’s weapons, training and finances, making it a well-resourced militia group with a sizeable army. It has an arsenal of 150,000 precision-guided missiles and hundreds of long-range rockets that can reach every part of Israel. A report inThe Wall Street Journalearlier this month alleged Iran helped Hamas to plot its attacks on Israel on 7 October, citing senior members of Hezbollah as its sources. The sources said a meeting between Hamas leadership and Iranian officials was held in Beirut just days before the co-ordinated attacks, which killed almost 1400 people, including women and children. Disaster for Lebanon Lebanon is already “teetering on the edge of economic and political collapse”, Asher Kaufman, a history professor from the University of Notre Dame said. “Hezbollah’s decision whether to fully join the war may answer a question that has been preoccupying analysts of the organisation for decades,” Professor Kaufman wrote for The Conversation. “Is its priority the wellbeing of Lebanon or acting as a proxy for Iran?” Should Hezbollah choose to honour its allegiance to Tehran, he said “Lebanon itself would move closer to the brink of absolute and irreversible collapse”. Professor Kaufman explained that Lebanon and its politics are dominated by a sectarian system that sees government and state positions divided among 18 officially recognised religious sects in the country. Sunnis, Maronite Christians, Druze and Shiites, among others, each have a mandated representation in government. “Today, the Shiite population is the largest sect in the country, making up 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the general population – but no exact figure is available because the sensitivity of the matter has meant no official census has been conducted since 1932,” Professor Kaufman said. After Hezbollah formed in the early 1980s, it grew to become “the country’s strongest political, socio-economic and military force”. “This is due to the support of Iran and a strong and cohesive internal social structure among its Shiite followers in the country. Not all Shiites identify with Hezbollah, but no doubt many of them sympathise with its causes.” Its own military force is far stronger than Lebanon’s and the militant group provides its own forms of social, economic and education services to Shiites, he added. A regional tinderbox For a long while, Lebanon enjoyed a period of stability and vitality, but the meltdown of its economy in 2019 sparked severe civil unrest. Its political system is now “gridlocked”. “Some already see Lebanon as a failed state, so the last thing the country needs is to become part of another war,” he said. Hezbollah holds significant political and social sway in Lebanon. When Hamas claimed Israel had deliberately bombed a hospital in Gaza last week, which it said killed hundreds and injured scores more, Hezbollah leaders encouraged civil unrest in Lebanon. Ugly protests broke out across Beirut, but similar demonstrations were also inspired in several other countries in the region, from Jordan and Iran to Syria and Yemen. Israel has said it has intelligence proving the hospital blast was the result of a misfiring rocket launched at Tel Aviv by the terror group Islamic Jihad. Regardless of the cause, the furious response shows Hezbollah is itching for a fight. The European Council on Foreign Relations said it would take “concerted diplomacy and considerable luck” to avoid a broader conflict in the region. “An escalation in the conflict would upturn a fragile period of regional calm which witnessed a détente between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and Israel’s increasing normalisation with key Arab states,” it said. “For now, regional players are keen to avoid a destabilising conflict which would threaten their own delicately balanced interests. Europeans should urgently join forces with them to support preventive diplomacy before it is too late.” “Risky behaviours” by China towards Australia could be pointing to a dangerous escalation which could blow up any moment. An Australian citizen has died in Ukraine, with reports suggesting the man was caught in heavy fighting in the east of the country. China has called Australia’s complaint over a dangerous incident between two warships “vague and one-sided”.",
‘For all’: Israeli diplomat’s big call on war,https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/israeli-ambassador-defends-strikes-against-gaza-claims-war-is-not-against-innocent-palestinians/news-story/bf1636871adf8f899959085e92ac594e,"Israel's ambassador to Australia has declared the escalating war crisis as the darkest moment in the state’s history and claimed Israel posed no threat to Palestinian civilians. Ambassador Amir Maimon addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday. He said the developing conflict was not about Israel but “the future of the entire Middle East” and “the world in which we live”. “It will have implications for all of us and a valuable and importance alliances forming between like-minded countries such as the United States, the UK, Australia,” Mr Maimon said. “On the other side, an evil coalition of rogue states and terrorist groups of which Hamas and Hezbollah are the most prominent are attempting to reshape the world of curling to their dangerous agenda.” Palestine’s health ministry has claimed more than 5000 people have died since Israel began launching retaliatory air strikes on October 7 following an attack by Hamas that killed 1400 people. Mr Maimon said Israeli attacks were “not against the Palestinian people” and declared the IDF was not responsible for civilian casualties. “The only actors that should be blamed for the death of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip are Hamas and the other extremist organisations in Gaza who hide among women and children, their own people,” he said. “Israel is defending itself and fighting for its life as a true democracy. It is doing everything in its power to avoid harming the innocent.” When asked about the Israeli military’s role in protecting innocent civilians, Mr Maimon said buildings struck by Israeli air strikes were “legitimate military targets” in accordance with international law. “We do no have any intention to harm innocent Palestinian civilians,” he claimed. Earlier, Australia’s foreign minister Penny Wong called for “humanitarian pauses on hostilities” in Gaza for the delivery of aid and evacuation of civilians. This echoed calls from the United Nations on Tuesday that proclaimed supplies were “barely making a dent”. Mr Maimon disagreed with Senator Wong’s assertions that not enough aid was flowing into Gaza. “With all due respect, she (Senator Wong) represents Australia and I represent Israel,” he said. “According to my information, the humanitarian situation is fair and once again, in recent days, we are allowed the passing of about 30 trucks from the Rafah passage from Egypt to the Gaza Strip.” “Risky behaviours” by China towards Australia could be pointing to a dangerous escalation which could blow up any moment. An Australian citizen has died in Ukraine, with reports suggesting the man was caught in heavy fighting in the east of the country. China has called Australia’s complaint over a dangerous incident between two warships “vague and one-sided”.",
‘Unimaginable’: Panic as new crisis ‘explodes’,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-live-updates-israel-blocks-united-nations-visas-amid-calls-for-un-head-to-resign/news-story/673e7ecd8e919dc4925f05e15cf0a7c0,"Welcome back to our live coverage of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The Israel Defense Force (IDF) carried out a “targeted raid” in Gaza overnight, with tanks rolling into the Strip. It said the raid was carried out as “preparation for the next stage of combat”. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said a date has been set for a ground incursion into Gaza - but has refused to reveal how many troops will enter the area or when it will begin. In a televised address, the Israeli Prime Minister described the war against the Palestinian terror group as a battle of “light” versus “darkness” and said Israel would “realise the prophecy of Isaiah”. It comes as human rights organisations warn not enough aid is making it into Gaza, with the WHO saying an “unimaginable catastrophe” is looming. Read on for the latest news. ‘There’ll be an explosion’: ‘Unimaginable’ disaster looms Israel has been accused of “politicising” the humanitarian aid it’s allowing into Gaza, and limiting it to such an extent that an “explosion” of refugees is becoming inevitable. Several dozen trucks carrying aid have been allowed into the Gaza Strip via its border with Egypt in recent days. Human rights advocates claim it’s nowhere near enough. “They are politicising the aid. They have put conditions on the type of aid that is allowed into Gaza. They are asking Palestinians to choose between water or food,” Tamer Qamout, a professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al-Jazeera. “All these items are crucial. It is a crime, by all means. “They are also keeping the scale very low. They are building the momentum for a huge crisis. There will be an explosion. There will be hundreds of thousands of people, at some point, marching to Egypt if aid is not scaled up. “We are heading into a disaster.” Meanwhile the World Health Organisation has renewed its calls for “immediate and uninterrupted access into and across Gaza”, saying its “ailing health system” needs to be revived urgently. “Without fuel, medicines and health supplies, Gaza’s hospitals are on the precipice of an unimaginable humanitarian catastrophe,” it said. Israel’s plans will ‘take years’ Benny Gantz, a former Israeli general who joined the country’s war cabinet in the wake of Hamas’s attacks on October 7, has issued yet another blunt warning to foreign groups that might consider interfering in the conflict. “The danger of destruction will not be our destiny, but rather the fate of those who would do evil to us,” he said. The message was presumably aimed mostly at Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon, which has been trading sporadic fire with Israeli positions across the border for weeks. Israel does not want a second front to open on its northern border while it is busy fighting Hamas down in the south. Gantz said the anticipated ground invasion of Gaza would be merely one step in a years-long process to secure southern Israel. “The battle against Gazan terror will continue within the Strip’s territory, going deep, anywhere and at any time requried to ensure security for the communities that will be restored and rebuilt in the region,” he said. “The manoeuvre will be but one stage of a long process that will include defensive, diplomatic and social aspects, (and) that will take years.” ‘Excruciating decision’ must be made The United Nations agency helping displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip says its supply of fuel, which it has been sharing, will run out today unless it makes an “excruciating” choice. The fuel has been used to help hospitals keep vital equipment, like life support machines and incubators, working. It’s also been used to power bakeries, ensuring people in shelters can be fed. But there isn’t enough fuel left to continue doing all of those things at once. “Do we give (it to) the incubators or the bakeries? It is an excruciating decision,” a spokeswoman, Tamara Alrifai, told The Associated Press. The World Health Organisation says a third of Gaza’s hospitals have already stopped running. Israel conducts overnight ‘targeted raid’ in GazaThe Israel Defence Force have conducted a “targeted” night raid in northern Gaza, with tanks seen rolling into the area ahead of the “next stages” of conflict. “Overnight, the IDF conducted a targeted raid using tanks in the northern Gaza Strip, as part of preparations for the next stages of combat,” the army said in a statement on X. During the raid, the military said tanks and infantry struck a number of terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts. Accompanying footage shows bulldozers and tanks driving into northern Gaza, before armoured vehicles fire at a number of targets. “The soldiers exited the area at the end of the activity,” the IDF said. ‘Complicity in genocide’: Law firm threatens legal action against PMThe Prime Minister and federal government have been threatened with legal action by a Sydney-based law firm acting on behalf of Palestinian Australians. Birchgrove Legal has sent a letter of demand to Anthony Albanese saying the government “appears to have contravened domestic and international law” over its stance on Israel and warned it was considering whether comments made by senior ministers amounted to “complicity in genocide and other crimes”. The 32-page letter, included public statements made by the prime minister, Foreign Minister Penny Wong, Defence Minister Richard Marles, and Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil, including Mr Albanese’s October 10 statement that, “we will stand with Israel, we always will”. The letter issues a series of demands to avoid legal action being taken, stating: “Immediate action must be taken to ensure that Australian government policy towards the unfolding catastrophe in Gaza complies with international law and places the core humanitarian principles of proportionality, distinction, precaution and humanity at its heart.” Birchgrove Legal solicitor Rita Jabri Markwell told radio station 3AW while it’s “within the right of Australian government ministers to stand with an ally” the line is crossed when the government is “standing with an ally that is acting outside the bonds of the rules of law”. “Under international criminal law if you know that another country is committing a crime, and you don’t say anything or you say just encouraging things and give moral support, that can have an encouraging effect on the person. And if they’re aware of your support, that brings you into the bounds of being complicit,” she said. “We’ve called for Albanese to issue a statement which acknowledges the breaches by Israel of international law, and… to take all means available to the Australian government to protect civilians in Gaza.” ‘Hellfire’: Worrying sign of full-scale war Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is readying a ground war in Gaza, pressing ahead with plans that have troubled allies and threaten to worsen an already cascading humanitarian crisis. Facing ever-louder international calls to temper Israel’s ferocious 19-day bombing campaign in the Hamas-controlled territory, Mr Netanyahu delivered a nationally televised address. He told fellow Israelis still grieving and angry after Hamas’s bloody attacks: “We are in the midst of a campaign for our existence”, while insisting Israel will decide how the war is prosecuted. US President Joe Biden is among the foreign leaders stepping up public calls for Israel to “protect innocent civilians” and to follow the “laws of war” as it pursues Hamas targets. Thousands of Gazans are already believed to have died in Israel’s aerial assault, with the toll expected to rise substantially if tens of thousands of Israeli troops massed around Gaza move in. Mr Biden on Wednesday said he had privately suggested Israel should get hostages out if possible before any ground invasion. “It’s their decision, but I did not demand it”, Mr Biden said, as he called on Congress to allocate more money for Israeli defence. Speaking in Cairo, French President Emmanuel Macron warned: “A massive intervention that would put civilian lives at risk would be an error.” But boasting of “raining down hellfire on Hamas” and killing “thousands of terrorists”, Mr Netanyahu said his war cabinet and the military would determine the timing of a “ground offensive” to “eliminate Hamas” and “bring our captives home.” “I will not detail when, how or how many,” he said. It comes after Mr Netanyahu earlier invoked an apocalyptic Old Testament prophecy often linked to the Second Coming of Christ in a televised speech on Wednesday night, when he described the war against Hamas as a battle of “light” versus “darkness” and said Israel would “realise the prophecy of Isaiah”. -with AFP Hamas holding 54 Thai hostages More than half of the estimated 220Israeli hostagescaptured by Hamas are also citizens of other countries, Israeli officials announced on Wednesday. At least 138 of the of the hostages had foreign passports, including 12 Americans, 12 Germans, 15 Argentinians, and six from both France and Russia, according to Reuters. Many of those people are believed to have dual nationality with Israel, except 54 Thais, five Nepalese, and single hostages from China, Sri Lanka, and two from both Tanzania and the Philippines. Thailand is one of Israel’s largest sources for foreign laborers — about 30,000 are employed in the country’s agricultural sector. At least 24 Thais have been confirmed killed in Hamas’ October 7 surprise attack on Israel, while 21 remain unaccounted for. Foreign victims identified as dead or missing in Hamas’ massacre totalled 328 people from 40 different countries, Israel said. Besides Thailand, foreign nations that experienced high death tolls included the United States with at least 34 dead and five still missing, Ukraine with 25 dead and two still missing, France with 23 dead and one missing, and 23 Russians dead and four missing. One Australian citizen, 66-year-oldGalit Carbone, was killed. — NY Post Al Jazeera journalist’s family killed The family of an Al Jazeera journalist have been killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza, the Qatar-based network said in a statement on Wednesday. Al Jazeera said the wife and two children of its Arabic-language channel’s Gaza bureau chief, Wael Al-Dahdouh, were killed in a strike on the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. “Members of the family of our colleague Wael Al-Dahdouh, including his wife, son, and daughter, were martyred in an Israeli bombing,” Al Jazeera wrote in an on-air message,per CNN. “The indiscriminate assault by the Israeli occupation forces resulted in the tragic loss of his wife, son and daughter, while the rest of his family is buried under the rubble.” The network reported that Al-Dahdouh’s grandson was declared dead two hours later. Israel has yet to respond to the claims. CNN noted Al Jazeera had not provided evidence directly linking the source of the blast to an Israeli air strike. In images and footage run by Al Jazeera and shared on social media, Al-Dahdouh was shown mourning over the bodies of his wife and children at a hospital in Deir el-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip.

Al Jazeera said the family were staying in a temporary home after evacuating Gaza City following Israel’s warning for residents to move south as its forces intensified strikes targeting Hamas. “This is the safe zone the occupation [Israeli] army was talking about,” Al-Dahdouh said on Al Jazeera. The media organisation said “their home was targeted in the Nuseirat camp in the centre of Gaza, where they had sought refuge after being displaced by the initial bombardment in their neighbourhood”. “Al Jazeera is deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of our colleagues in Gaza and hold the Israeli authorities responsible for their security,” it added. The International Press Institute described thereported killingas “horrifying and outrageous news”. “Journalists in Gaza forced to fear not only for their own lives, but for their lives of their families as they courageously cover this war,” the group said on X. According to a statement from the Committee to Protect Journalists earlieron Wednesday, at least 24 journalists have died since the war broke out on October 7, including 20 Palestinians, three Israelis and one Lebanese reporter. It comes after Israel last week approved emergency regulations paving the way toshut downAl Jazeera’s offices in the country, claiming the foreign broadcaster was harming its national security. “Al Jazeera’s broadcasts and reports constitute incitement against Israel, help Hamas-ISIS and the terror organisations with their propaganda, and encourage violence against Israel,” Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said in a statement on Friday. US forces face spike in attacks American and allied forces deployed in Iraq and Syria as part of an international anti-jihadist coalition have been repeatedly targeted by drone and missile attacks this month. Although the attacks have not been claimed by a known group with documented links to Iran, Washington says Tehran is involved and has threatened to respond “decisively” to strikes by its proxies. The recent spike in attacks is linked to the latest war between Israel and Hamas. Armed factions close to Iran have threatened to attack US interests over Washington’s support for Israel, with one of them — Ketaeb Hezbollah — demanding that American forces leave Iraq or “taste the fires of hell”. The Pentagon said there were 10 attacks on American and allied forces in Iraq and three in Syria between October 17 and 24, involving a “mix of one-way attack drones and rockets”. Many — though not all — of the recent attacks have been claimed by the “Islamic Resistance in Iraq”. It is not one of the established militant groups operating in the region and has not publicly claimed affiliation with or backing from a specific government. But its claims of attacks on US forces have appeared in Telegram channels used by pro-Iranian armed factions, and the Pentagon has said the organisations “conducting these attacks are supported by the IRGC and the Iranian regime” — a reference to Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The White House has meanwhile said Iran is “actively facilitating” attacks on US forces in the Middle East. Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, said the “Islamic Resistance in Iraq is a media claiming name, it’s not a group”. It is the result of various existing Iran-backed groups in Iraq deciding “during the duration of this Gaza conflict to jointly claim all of their attacks,” he said. The impact of the attacks has been relatively limited so far, but the possibility of escalation is high. The Pentagon said Wednesday that 21 US personnel “received minor injuries due to drone attacks” in Iraq and Syria last week, but that all of them returned to duty. And a US civilian contractor suffered a “cardiac episode” and died while sheltering at a base in Iraq after early warning systems indicated a threat was approaching, according to the Pentagon, which said an attack ultimately did not occur in that case. There is significant potential for the situation to worsen, especially in the event that a drone or rocket directly kills American personnel. “What we are seeing is the prospect for more significant escalation against US forces and personnel across the region in the very near term coming from Iranian proxy forces, and ultimately from Iran,” the Pentagon said. There are roughly 2500 American troops in Iraq and some 900 in Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group, which once held significant territory in both countries but was pushed back by local ground forces backed by international air strikes in a bloody multi-year conflict. US forces and other personnel from the international coalition against the jihadists are deployed at bases in Iraq and Syria that have been the target of the attacks, but the facilities are ultimately controlled by local forces rather than international troops. American troops in Iraq are playing a training and advisory role following the official end of the coalition’s combat mission in December 2021, while those in Syria conduct frequent raids against IS. ‘Prophecy of Isaiah’: PM’s doomsday warning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has invoked an apocalyptic Old Testament prophecy often linked to the Second Coming of Christ in a televised speech about the war against Hamas. In a night-time address on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu described the war against the Palestinian terror group as a battle of “light” versus “darkness” and said Israel would “realise the prophecy of Isaiah”. “Our war against Hamas is a test for all of humanity, it is a struggle between the axis of evil of Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, and the axis of freedom and progress,” he said, according to a translation by Israel’si24 News. “We are the people of the light, they are the people of darkness, and light shall triumph over darkness. “As Prime Minister I am responsible for guaranteeing the future of this country and now my role is to lead all Israelis, the state of Israel and the people of Israel, to an overpowering victory. “It is now a time to come together for one purpose, to storm ahead to achieve victory. With joint forces and a profound belief in our justness, a profound belief in the eternity of the Jewish people, we shall realise the prophecy of Isaiah.” Isaiah was anIsraelite prophetwho lived in the 8th century BC. In addition to foreshadowing the coming of the Messiah — interpreted by Christians in the New Testament to be Jesus Christ —Isaiah’s propheciescover the worldwide persecution of Jews and the restoration of Israel. Mr Netanyahu has previously quoted the Book of Isaiah in public speeches, telling the United Nations in 2017 that Israel is “a light unto the nations, bringing salvation to the ends of the earth”. Writing for Bloombergon Wednesday, Professor of History at the University of Georgia, Stephen Mihm, noted that many American evangelical Christians see the Israel-Hamas war as “part of a prophecy” linked to the Second Coming of Christ. “Israel first became central to evangelical eschatology four centuries ago, when Protestant theologians, especially those of a millenarian bent, seized upon very specific passages about the end times,” Prof Mihm said. “For example, in the Old Testament, the prophet Isaiah predicted that God ‘shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the Earth’. “Exegetes took this to mean that the return of Christ would take place once the Jewish diaspora returned to Palestine. Eager to put God’s plan in motion, these Christian Zionists — not an oxymoron — began to push their governments to take active steps to get Jews back to Palestine.” Following Israel’s triumph over its neighbours in the Six Day War of 1967, evangelicals “felt increasingly confident” that Israel embodied the “final countdown” to the Armageddon. “All that remained was for Israel to secure a final victory over its enemies and rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem,” he said. “And then, if the prophets were right, some pretty unpleasant things would happen — a false messiah known as the Antichrist would take over Jerusalem and install himself as the saviour before inaugurating the Tribulation, a seven-year period of death and destruction, with most Jews perishing. Finally, Jesus would return to earth, overthrowing the pretender and inaugurating a thousand-year reign of peace on Earth.” Prof Mihm said for decades the two groups had formed an unusual alliance with a “shared ambition to see Israel conquer its enemies” — for rather different reasons. “The Israelis had practical aims, hoping that American support would preserve their embattled nation,” he said. “The evangelicals, by contrast, prayed that aid would trigger the apocalypse and set the stage for the coming of Christ.” Release hostages on ‘health grounds’: WHO The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday called for Hamas to provide proof of life of the hostages it is holding and release them all on health grounds. The WHO said the International Committee of the Red Cross should be allowed immediate medical access to ascertain their health status, while it stands ready to provide the ICRC with any health support required for the hostages. The WHO said it was “gravely concerned” for the health of the hostages, which, it said, include health workers and up to 30 children. “There is an urgent need for the captors of the hostages to provide signs of life, proof of provision of health care and the immediate release, on humanitarian and health grounds, of all those abducted,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. He held talks on Wednesday with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli non-governmental organisation which represents families of those abducted. He said he “heard first-hand the tragedy, trauma and suffering they are facing”. “Many of the hostages, including children, women and the elderly, have pre-existing health conditions requiring urgent and sustained care and treatment. The mental health trauma that the abducted, and the families, are facing is acute and psychosocial support is of great importance,” he said. Mr Tedros said the UN health agency would do “all we can to support the health and humanitarian needs of those being held captive”. “All civilians who are suffering in this conflict must be protected,” he added. He called on all 194 WHO member states to put people’s health first and “take immediate action to end the ongoing suffering”. The UN health agency has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire for the safe delivery of health supplies and fuel throughout the Gaza Strip. Biden says Israel must protect civilians US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that Israel has the right to respond to the October 7 Hamas attack but must do everything it can to protect civilians. As international pressure mounts for a ceasefire, Mr Biden told a press conference with visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that he “did not demand” that Israel delay a ground invasion of Gaza. “Israel has a right, and I would add responsibility, to respond to the slaughter of its people,” Mr Biden told reporters in the Rose Garden at the White House. Mr Biden accused Gaza’s rulers Hamas of “hiding behind” Palestinian civilians, as Israel bombards the territory, but said Israel must follow the “laws of war”. “Israel has to do everything in its power, as difficult as it is, to protect innocent civilians. It’s difficult,” he said. Mr Biden also called for an immediate end to Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank. “That’s pouring gasoline on the fire,” he said. “They’re attacking Palestinians in places that they’re entitled, and … it has to stop now.” Mr Biden, however, cast doubt on civilian casualty figures put forward by the Palestinians. “I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s a price of waging war,” he said. “But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.” US media have meanwhile reported that Mr Biden has pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on a ground invasion of Gaza while Hamas still holds hostages, but Mr Biden denied it. “What I have indicated to him is that if that’s possible to get these folks out safely, that’s what he should do. It’s their decision,” Mr Biden said. “But I did not demand it. I put it out to him, if it’s real, it should be done.” Ten Americans remain unaccounted for after the Hamas attacks and a number are believed to be among the hostages. Two US women were released by the militant group last week. Mr Netanyahu said in a televised address minutes before Mr Biden and Mr Albanese spoke that “we are preparing the ground offensive” but refused to say when or what form it would take. The US President meanwhile said there “has to be a vision of what comes next” after the conflict. “In our view it has to be a two state solution,” he said. “It means a concentrated effort for all the parties [including Israel, the Palestinians and regional powers including Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia].” Mr Biden reiterated that he was “convinced” that one of the reasons for the Hamas attack was to derail his bid to normalise relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Israel PM: Date for Gaza offensive set In a night time address on Israeli television on Wednesday local time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out his plans for an incursion into Gaza. “We are preparing for a ground operation,” he said, adding that “the timing of the operation was decided unanimously by the war cabinet”, reported Israeli newspaperHaaretz. However, he did not say when the move might happen with reports an invasion is on hold under pressure from the US. According toThe Wall Street Journal, Israel has agreed to delay any incursion into Gaza until the US can reinforce its defence installations in the Middle East. The US has bases in Iraq, Syria, Qatar and other countries. Already some missiles, believed to be from Iran-backed proxies, have been targeted at bases. The US is said to be rushing missile defence systems to a number of air bases as it expects attacks to increase if Israel moves into Gaza. In his address Mr Netanyahu also appeared to acknowledge some of the blame for Israel’s failure in not knowing an attack would take place would fall on him. “Everyone will have to answer [for the attack], including me, but that will only happen after the war,” he said. He added work was ongoing to free more than 200 hostages. Queen hits out at ‘glaring double standard’ The Queen of Jordan has said the West has a “glaring double standard” over the conflict. Talking toCNN, Queen Rania said Western leaders had quickly expressed outraged at the Hamas atrocities on October 7 but claimed they had failed to condemn the killing of civilians in Gaza due to Israeli air strikes. Jordan borders Israel and the West Bank and is a major ally of the US in the region. It signed a peace deal with Israel in 1994. “In the last couple of weeks, we have seen a glaring double standard in the world,” Queen Rania said. “When October 7 happened, the world immediately and unequivocally stood by Israel and its right to defend itself and condemned the attack that happened. But what we’re seeing in the last couple of weeks, we’re seeing silence in the world.” Queen Rania made comparisons between how Hamas killed Israelis and Israel killed Palestinians. “Are we being told that it is wrong to kill a family, an entire family, at gunpoint, but it’s OK to shell them to death?” she said. “It is just shocking to the Arab world.” UN chief hits back: ‘This is false’ United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has said he was “shocked” at the reaction to comments he made at the UN and claimed they had been “misinterpreted” amid a huge row with Israel. On Tuesday, Mr Guterres had said Hamas’ massacre “did not happen in a vacuum”. He also called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire” and said “clear violations of international humanitarian law” were occurring every day in Gaza. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, hit back at Mr Guterres, demanding he “resign immediately” and claiming he was “not fit to lead the UN”. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen then said he would not meet with Mr Guterres and that his comments were “shocking” and “disconnected from the reality in our region”. Israel later announced it would halt visas for UN officials. “It’s time we teach them a lesson,” Mr Erdan told the Israeli Army Radio on Wednesday. But on Wednesday, US time, Mr Guterres said he in turn was “shocked” at the reception to his statement. He reiterated that his comments placed the current conflict against the backdrop of 56 years of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza but repeated that did not justify Hamas’ actions which saw 1400 people die. “As if it was justifying acts of terror by Hamas,” he tells reporters. “This is false. It was the opposite.” Turkey calls Hamas a ‘liberation group’ In a speech which is sure to anger Israel, Turkey’s President has said Hamas is not a terrorist group, but rather a “liberation group”. Turkey is a member of NATO and an ally of the US. While it is a Muslim majority country it is officially a secular government. In a speech to parliament on Wednesday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey “doesn’t owe” Israel anything. Mr Erdogan did say that Turkey had “no problem with the state of Israel”, but said it disapproved of the “atrocities” he said had been caused by Israel. “Killing people, women and children, innocent people cannot be justified, even if in response to some acts which we do not condone,” he said. Mr Erdogan, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York just last month, has now said he has cancelled a planned trip to Israel. US warns against all-out ground assault Israel says it may be poised to move into the Gaza Strip, but the US is further advising caution against what could be a bloody and difficult battle. According toCNN, US military officials have told Israel that the lesson it learned in Iraq was not to get embroiled in brutal house-to-house combat. Specifically, military planners have recalled the battle of Fallujah in 2004 as an example of what could lie ahead. It was the deadliest battle of the Iraq War for US troops with almost 100 killed and more than 500 wounded. Around 800 civilians died. CNN said the view in Washington was a plan to invade Gaza was “half baked” and could lead to many deaths and Israeli forces unable to leave the territory. “I don’t think Israel has a strategy for what they do next,” a source familiar with the US government told the network. UN warns power will run out within hours The United Nations says fuel in Gaza will run out on Wednesday night, local time, unless fresh supplies are delivered immediately. Hospitals are now being forced to only operate on life-threatening injuries as essential medical reserves deplete. The World Health Organization’s Dr Richard Peeperkorn said healthcare facilities were running on the lowest possible generator levels as they await further aid. “We have teams on the ground in Gaza and we know from the ground that fuel is absolutely limited,” he said. “The hospitals we work with, they all run the generator at minimum levels, only for lifesaving operations.” Syrian soldiers killed in Israel air strikes Eight Syrian soldiers have been killed and a further seven wounded after Israeli strikes on military positions in the nation’s south. Syria’s state news agency SANA said the attack occurred after midnight local time on Wednesday. Israel’s military confirmed it had attacked Syrian targets near the Jordan border, reporting that fighter jets carried out a strike on military infrastructure and mortar launchers after rockets were fired. Female IDF squad ‘kills 100 militants’ An all-female Israel Defence Force unit eliminated nearly 100 Hamas terrorists, according to their commander, who cited it as proof there “are no more doubts about female combat soldiers”. Israeli Caracal Battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Or Ben-Yehuda praised her unit for its bravery in the southern Gaza Strip, where the female troops took down approximately 100 Hamas terrorists Ms Ben-Yehuda said she received a message reporting an infiltration of heavily armed terrorists near Sufa and Nirim and told her soldiers, “We are going out to eliminate terrorists. Infiltration into Israel is happening, and it’s spreading.” “Stay alert. We might cross paths. We are a strong squad,” she told her unit as they headed to Sufa. Combat between the female battalion and the terrorists lasted nearly four hours and included large firefights. It took the IDF about 14 hours altogether to secure the base. Australia sends troops, planes Australia is sending troops and two military transport aircraft to the Middle East as concern grows for Australian citizens in the region. Defence Minister Richard Marles said a “significant number” of troops were being sent but declined to give the number. Two C-130J Super Hercules aircraft had also been deployed. Mr Marles would not say where the aircraft and troops would be based. The planes will add to a C-17A Globemaster heavy transport aircraft and a KC-30 air refueller already in the area. “The point of this is to provide support to Australian populations who are in the Middle East if this gets worse,” he told the ABC. More than 800 Australians have been flown out of Israel since October 13. Mr Marles said the Australian government is trying to help 79 citizens in Gaza and 51 in the West Bank who have asked to leave. The chief of the ADF, General Angus Campbell, warned the conflict was in its early stages. “The conflict that we see between Israel and Hamas appears to be in its early stages, and we want to be well-positioned,” he said. “I would very much encourage Australians to follow DFAT’s advisories in regard to travel and to pay attention to their safety.” — with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Cruel hostage moment Hamas didn’t show,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/idf-slams-manipulation-after-elderly-hostages-freed/news-story/41df5264dc2e4480df4d34a6a7fc6f49,"Israel has urged the world not to be “manipulated” by Hamas after the Palestinian terror group released two more hostages this week. Israel was left stunned after militants from the Palestinian Islamist movement stormed across the Gaza border on October 7 and went on a rampage that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people. They also snatched more than 220 hostages in the worst-ever attack in Israel’s history, which has prompted a ferocious Israeli bombardment of the coastal Palestinian territory which Gaza’s Hamas rulers say has killed 5,791 people. Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and Nurit Cooper, 79, were released on Monday after more than two weeks in captivity. Both of theiroctogenarian husbands are still in Gaza. Hamas has now freed four women following the release of an American mother and daughter, Judith Tai Raanan and Natalie Raanan, 17, on Friday, for “humanitarian reasons”. “This is how Hamas manipulates the world,” the IDF captioned a video on X. “They keep 222 civilians hostage and then make the world believe they are humane. The worst part is, the world believes.” In the video, the IDF urged viewers not to lose sight of the horrific October 7 invasion of southern Israel by Hamas terrorists. “Three weeks before being served coffee for the cameras, these 80-year-old women were brutally abducted from their homes and held hostage in Gaza,” the video said. “Two may have been released, but 222 are still held hostage. Don’t let Hamas manipulate you.” Elderly Israeli woman recalls hostage ‘hell’ An 85-year-old Israeli woman freed after more than two weeks in Hamas captivity spoke Tuesday about the “hell” of her abduction. Ms Lifshitz, one of two elderly Israeli women released Monday, recalled how gunmen raided her kibbutz home, throwing her over the back of a motorbike and beat her on the way to Gaza. “They didn’t break my ribs, but they hurt me very much,” she told reporters after being freed with 79-year-old Nurit Cooper on what Hamas said was “compelling humanitarian” grounds following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. Both of their octogenarian husbands are still in Gaza. Hamas has now freed four women following the release of an American mother and daughter at the weekend. After the violence of her abduction, Lifshitz said their captors had “treated us well”, describing them as courteous and explaining how a doctor visited every few days. ‘Epic suffering’ Meanwhile on the ground in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry said on Tuesday evening that “about 50” people had been killed across the Strip in one hour as Israel “expands” its air raids. In the southern city of Rafah a man in a wheelchair could be seen being transported by a donkey-drawn cart to safety inside a UN school in Rafah while elsewhere in the southern city, people dug through the rubble to try and reach people trapped underneath. “In Rafah, there’s one machine while around five houses get bombarded per day,” said Jamal Abu Ahmed, pleading for more machinery to help “retrieve children from under collapsed houses”. UN figures show more than 1.4 million people — out of a total population of 2.4 million — have been displaced within Gaza since the war began, with nearly 590,000 people taking shelter in its schools. The ongoing bloodshed and humanitarian crisis in Gaza sparked stormy exchanges at a UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday with the UN chief saying there had been “clear violations” of international law, prompting an angry exchange with Israel’s top diplomat. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Minns’ big admission on Opera House protest,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/politics/nsw-premier-chris-minns-says-he-shouldnt-have-allowed-sydney-opera-house-protests/news-story/034dcb4f9f6ccd82d488a713cc2a183e,"NSW Premier Chris Minns has issued a mea culpa over his role in failing to control the events in the lead up to the Opera House protests which lead to 1400 pro-Palestinian protesters storming the forecourt. Confronted with a barrage of questions during budget estimates on Wednesday, Mr Minns said the government should have not allowed protesters to advance to the Opera House while it was being illuminated with the colours of the Israeli flag, as a tribute to the victims of the Hamas attacks. Chaotic scenes showed some attendees chanting anti-Semitic slurs, burning the Israeli flag and throwing flares at police. “I deeply regret that and I have to take responsibility for it,” he told the committee. Although he had been made aware of the escalating tensions, including revised plans by the Palestine Action Group to march to the Opera House, he said he didn’t think at the time to issue orders to prevent the rally from happening. “I should have, in retrospect, (not allowed) protests from Town Hall to the Opera House” he said. “We should have made the Opera House Forecourt in the immediate precinct an opportunity for the Jewish community to come together and if there were other protests in other parts of the city, then that should have been allowed to happen but well away from the community that wanted to come together and grieve. “So I’m admitting that and the only thing I can is we apologise, and we want to learn from it.” Mr Minns also detailed the conversations he had with his staff during the day, including 11 conversations with his chief of staff, seven conversations with Multiculturalism Minister Steve Kamper, about three calls with Jewish Board of Deputies president David Ossip, plus a call with the Police Minister Yasmin Catley, and Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House, Penny Sharpe. On Tuesday, internal communications between senior NSW Police staff revealed police held concerns over the impact of illuminating the Opera House sails, and feared it could exacerbate community tensions. In an email time-stamped at 6.10pm on Sunday, October 8, a senior staffer in Police Commissioner Karen Webb’s office said the Acting Commissioner David Hudson and herself were “both equally concerned” at how lighting the sails of the Opera House would impact “our streets,” and the “potential further escalation of current tensions in the Jewish Israeli communities”. The same email also included a request for “an urgent threat assessment” on the impact and risk. However, the Premier said that he would have committed to the Opera House tribute regardless. “I think we made the right decision and given the circumstances, I would have made the same decision,” he said. “Municipalities and cities around the world would have been faced with exactly the same set of circumstances and I think it’s important for the committee to note most jurisdictions made exactly the same call.” The Premier was also quizzed about NSW’s drug policy, including when the government would hold its drug summit. Giving more details into the inquiry, Mr Minns said the government was “tracking” to hold the summit next year but wasn’t able to offer any more details. Previously, the government said the summit would be held in the current term of government that ends in 2027. “I can’t give you a month. I can’t announce that today, but obviously it would be better to have it earlier in the term than later and there are pressing issues that are affecting a lot of people’s lives,” Mr Minns said. Although the Premier said he was “not closing the door in relation to reform” on the management of drugs at music festivals, including pill and drug testing, he said the policy wasn’t “straightforward”. “I had a close look at (drug testing), as well as the Minister for Health, and my concern is that mobile testing facilities at music festivals will determine whether there’s an alien substance in drugs … but it won’t measure potency,” he said. “Examining the tragic deaths associated with drug use at music festivals, potency, generally speaking, is the reason people die, not a toxic substance or an alien substance in their drugs.” Liberal upper house MP Damien Tudehope also asked Mr Minns about an overseas trip he took to China in 2015. Mr Minns said he wasn’t aware who funded the trip but believed it was an Australia-Chinese business organisation. The controversial trip was taken with other government figures, including Labor frontbencher Chris Bowen. Mr Minns was also asked about comments he made in his maiden speech to NSW parliament that all NSW students should learn Mandarin. He said he no longer maintained those views. “Australia’s relationship with China has changed significantly since 2018, and I believe that while second languages are important, and that they should be encouraged in school, young people in particular should have access to a whole range of secondary languages,” he said. “The truth is, for the sake of both our multicultural communities and future trade and investment opportunities, we should, in effect, let as many languages be taught and learned by young people as possible.” Protesters dressed in hazmat suits were kicked out of the NSW Liberal Party conference for calling Opposition Leader Peter Dutton the “MP for Fukushima”. A former Liberal candidate who nearly ousted now NSW Premier Chris Minns from his seat, has been endorsed as the candidate to win back John Howard’s old seat. One of the victims of a pedophile former state MP says he “never got back on track” after being sexually abused as a boy.",
‘Teach them a lesson’: Israel’s bitter move,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-live-updates-abc-smashed-over-disgraceful-interview-with-hamas-official/news-story/5e19d3158ae16f05ca13d58e162bbaeb,"Welcome back to our live coverage of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. More than 1400 people have been killed in Israel since Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on October 7, according to Israeli authorities. The Gaza health ministry, which is under the control of Hamas, says the Palestinian death toll has risen to 5791, including 2360 children, with 704 deaths in the last 24 hours. Those numbers have not been independently verified. A statement from the Palestinian media office said “more than 80 people” were killed and “hundreds wounded” after raids by Israel were carried out on Tuesday night. Australia has now committed troops and aircraft to the Middle East as the global leaders continue to show support for Israel. “The deployment of Australian aircraft and supporting Defence personnel is a precautionary measure to support whole of Australian Government contingency options due to the risk of the security situation deteriorating further,” Defence Minister Richard Marles said on Wednesday. Read on for the latest news. UN warns power will run out tonight The United Nations says fuel in Gaza will run out tonight, unless fresh supplies are delivered immediately. Hospitals are now being forced to only operate on life-threatening injuries as essential medical reserves deplete.

Syria’s state news agency SANA said the attack occurred after midnight local time on Wednesday. Israel’s military confirmed it had attacked Syrian targets near the Jordan border, reporting that fighter jets carried out a strike on military infrastructure and mortar launchers after rockets were fired. ‘Teach them a lesson’: Tensions flare at UN Security Council UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire” saying that “clear violations of international humanitarian law” are occurring every day in Gaza. Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan hit back immediately at Mr Guterres, demanding he “resign immediately” and claiming he was “not fit to lead the UN”. It came as Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who was at the United Nations on Tuesday, said he would not meet with Mr Guterres and that “there is no place for a balanced approach”. Mr Cohen described Mr Guterres’ comments as “shocking” and “disconnected from the reality in our region”. Israel later announced it would halt visas for UN officials following Mr Guterres’ comments. “As a result of this, we will refuse visas to UN representatives,” Mr Erdan told the Israeli Army Radio on Wednesday. “It‘s time we teach them a lesson.” Meanwhile, US military officials are attempting to persuade Israel against a full-scale ground invasion, citing past experiences with urban combat against insurgents during the Iraq War. Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong also called for an immediate “pause on hostilities”. “We call for humanitarian pauses on hostilities, so food, water, medicine and other essential assistance can reach people in desperate need, and so civilians can get to safety,” Ms Wong said in a statement posted on her official X account. Female IDF squad eliminates nearly 100 Hamas militants An all-female Israel Defense Force unit eliminated nearly 100 Hamas terrorists, according to their commander, who cited it as proof there “are no more doubts about female combat soldiers.” Israeli Caracal Battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Or Ben-Yehuda praised her unit for its bravery in the southern Gaza Strip, where the female troops took down approximately 100 Hamas terrorists Ben-Yehuda said she received a message reporting an infiltration of heavily armed terrorists near Sufa and Nirim and told her soldiers: “We are going out to eliminate terrorists.

Combat between the female battalion and the terrorists lasted nearly four hours and included large firefights. It took the IDF about 14 hours altogether to secure the base. At least 1,400 Israelis and 5,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, while tens of thousands on both sides have been injured or displaced from their homes due to the conflict, officials on both sides have said. Australia sends troops, planes Australia issending troopsand two military transport aircraft to the Middle East as concern grows for Australian citizens in the region. Defence Minister Richard Marles said a “significant number” of troops were being sent but declined to give the number. Two C-130J Super Hercules aircraft had also been deployed. Mr Marles would not say where the aircraft and troops would be based. The planes will add to a C-17A Globemaster heavy transport aircraft and a KC-30 air refueller already in the area. “The point of this is to provide support to Australian populations who are in the Middle East if this gets worse,” he told the ABC. More than 800 Australians have been flown out of Israel since October 13. Mr Marles said the Australian government is trying to help 79 citizens in Gaza and 51 in the West Bank who have asked to leave. The chief of the ADF, General Angus Campbell, warned the conflict was in its early stages. “The conflict that we see between Israel and Hamas appears to be in its early stages, and we want to be well-positioned,” he said. “I would very much encourage Australians to follow DFAT’s advisories in regard to travel and to pay attention to their safety.” Hamas planners used ‘hardwired phones’ Hamas operatives used hardwired phones built into the vast tunnel network beneath Gaza to plan the deadly October 7 attack without being spied on by Israeli or US intelligence, according to a new report. Hamas claims to have a network oftunnels underneaththe Gaza Strip stretching 500 kilometres, complete with plumbing and electricity, which it uses to store rockets and ammunition and hold prisoners. The deadly assault, which completely blindsided Israel’s vaunted intelligence agencies, was planned over two years by a small Hamas cell, who stayed dark until it was time to call on hundreds of terrorists to launch the attack,CNN reports. Sources briefed on the matter told the broadcaster that intelligence shared with the US by Israel suggested the planners used hardwired phone lines in the tunnels to communicate, and avoided using computers or mobile phones during the two years to evade detection. The intelligence reportedly revealed how Hamas hid planning of the operation using old-fashioned measures such as conducting meetings in person and staying off digital communications. “There wasn’t a lot of discussion and back and forth and co-ordination outside of the immediate area,” one of the sources told CNN. The planning cell waited until just before the attack to prep a larger group of fighters above-ground. At least 1500 Hamas terrorists poured across the border into southern Israel on October 7, brutally massacring 1400 people and abducting more than 200 hostages. Sources told CNN that Hamas fighters were being trained for months and kept at a state of general readiness, but were only informed of the specific plans in the days leading up to the attack. One source said some of the training above-ground was observed but did not ring major alarm bells, as the thinking was “oh they always train people like this … it didn’t look different”. Israel hits ‘military infrastructure’ in Syria The Israeli army said on Wednesday that it had struck military infrastructure inside Syria in response to earlier launches towards Israel. The IDF said in a statement that its “fighter jets struck military infrastructure and mortar launchers belonging to the Syrian Army in response to the launches toward Israel yesterday [Tuesday]”. A military spokesperson told AFP the strikes were inside Syria. Fears are growing that Israel’s war with Hamas will create wider regional turmoil, and especially further inflame existing tensions with Syria and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon. Israeli strikes on Sunday put war-torn Syria’s two main airports out of service, according to Syrian state media. While Israeli strikes have repeatedly caused the grounding of flights at the government-controlled airports in the capital Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo, it is the second time since this month’s conflict between Israel and Hamas began that the two sites have been struck simultaneously. Earlier in the month, Israeli strikes targeted Aleppo airport, wounding five people, a war monitor reported, and also put it out of service, according to the authorities. During more than a decade of war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of air strikes on its northern neighbour, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters, as well as Syrian army positions. Israel rarely comments on individual strikes it carries out on Syria, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow its arch-foe Iran, which supports President Bashar al-Assad’s government, to expand its presence there. Hamas’ fiendish plan for hostages Hamas is following a fiendishly “calculated” blueprint in itshostage releaseto try to curry global favour — and it likely doesn’t include freeing any Israeli soldiers without major quid pro quo, a top expert says. The move by the Palestinian terrorists to release an American mother and daughter first last week was probably designed to pressure the Biden administration into urging Israel to delay its planned scorched-earth ground invasion of the Gaza Strip to buy time in the hostage crisis, former FBI agent and hostage-team expert Christopher O’Leary told theNY Poston Tuesday. Hamas’ release of another pair of women, two elderly Israelis, late Monday was also a “very calculated” move — this time to try and show the world that it is “a legitimate negotiator with some kind of humanitarian leaning”, Mr O’Leary said — even though the terrorists brutalised women and children during their bloody invasion of Israel on October 7. After former hostage Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, was released Monday, she revealed that she and a few of herfellow captiveswere separated from the main group into a smaller room in Hamas’ infamous “spiderweb” of Gaza tunnels. Mr O’Leary said the move wasn’t surprising. “Hamas has [probably] bucketed the victims into different groups — women and children, people with medical conditions, dual nationals like Americans, Israeli civilians and Israeli military,” he said. “You don’t want soldiers mixed with civilians. Because the soldiers are going to be looking for an opportunity to break out or gather information, and they’re going to need more security on them.” Mrs Lifschitz — who was beaten during capture but did not have any visible physical injuries when released — said the terrorists were “friendly in their own way” to the hostages she saw, making sure they had food and proper medical care. “Hamas looks at [hostages] as currency,” Mr O’Leary explained. “Like a cattle farmer, they want to keep their herd healthy and well-looked-after. And they want to be able to conduct a transaction at some point. But it’s not for any humanitarian reason.” Both Mrs Lifschitz and her neighbour, 79-year-old Nurit Cooper, were released without their husbands, who remain in captivity in Gaza. Mr O’Leary speculated that such civilian hostages “will be allowed to drip out over time” to delay the Gaza invasion and rehabilitate Hamas’ image. But Hamas will not unilaterally release the soldier hostages, who are their most valuable bargaining chips, he said. “Hamas held one Israeli soldier hostage from 2006 to 2011 — and [the terrorists] were able to negotiate the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners,” Mr O’Leary said, referring to the prisoner exchange deal for Israeli Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit. Unfortunately, the number of hostages that Israeli and US authorities believe have been taken is likely higher than they’ve said, according to the expert. “I don’t think the Israeli number [of around 200 hostages] is completely accurate,” he said. “They are putting out what they can confirm, and they are not going to confirm someone is a hostage unless they have information that corroborates that.” — NY Post Australia calls for ‘humanitarian pause’ Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong has called for “humanitarian pauses in hostilities” so aid can be delivered to Gaza. “The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire and human suffering is widespread,” she said in a statementon Wednesday. “Australia has consistently called for the protection of civilian lives. “We have consistently called for safe, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access, and safe passage for civilians. “There has been access in recent days but nowhere near enough. “We call for humanitarian pauses in hostilities, so food, water, medicine and other essential assistance can reach people in desperate need, and so civilians can get to safety. “The way Israel exercises its right to defend itself matters. It matters to civilians throughout the region, and it matters to Israel’s ongoing security. “Innocent Palestinian civilians should not suffer because of the outrages perpetrated by Hamas. “Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people and undermines the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.” ‘Triumph’: Fury over TV interview UK broadcaster ITVhas apologisedafter airing an interview with a British Palestinian woman for a segment on “Islamophobia”, days after she celebrated the Hamas terror attack as a “homecoming” and “moment of triumph”. Latifa Abouchakra, a reporter for Iranian state news channel Press TV, was interviewed for the ITV program about her experiences of Islamophobia in the UK, telling the program she had been “called a terrorist” by strangers in the street. But Jewish groups have blasted the TV channel for “staggering failures of due diligence”, after it emerged Abouchakra had produced a report hailing the October 7 terror attacks as a “homecoming by the Palestinian resistance” and describing the hundreds of hostages as “prisoners of war”. She also shared a video on Instagram shortly after the attacks, giddily celebrating the massacre. “Nothing will ever be able to take back this moment,” she said. “This moment of triumph, this moment of resistance, this moment of surprise, this moment of humiliation on behalf of the Zionist entity. Nothing, ever.” In a letter to ITV, Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said the decision to give a platform to Abouchakra was “an astonishingly bad one”. “As a 20-second internet search could have informed your channel’s researchers, Ms Abouchakra is a reporter forPalestine Declassified, a show produced by Press TV, the state channel of the Iranian regime,” she wrote. “This was a catastrophic breach of your channel’s journalistic standards. I sincerely hope that your channel will be issuing a public apology for this egregiously incompetent decision.” ITV News editor Andrew Dagnell apologised in a letter on Tuesday. “Please be reassured that we would not have included the contributor you refer to had we been aware of her previous comments,” he wrote. “We recognise that better due diligence should have taken place before she was featured. We apologise for this. ITV News London will tighten up the procedures around booking interviewees. ITV News has a responsibility to accuracy and due impartiality. We take these responsibilities particularly seriously while reporting on the situation in Israel and Gaza.” ‘Ask Hamas’: IDF mocks UN fuel warning Israel has hit back at the United Nations after its Palestinian refugee arm warned it was running out of fuel, telling it to “ask Hamas” for some. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said on Tuesday that Gaza was facing a “catastrophic” humanitarian crisis after Israel cut off almost all water supplies as well as food, fuel and electricity, warning its crucial aid operations were poised to grind to a halt without fuel. “If we do not get fuel urgently, we will be forced to halt our operations in the Gaza Strip as of tomorrow night,” UNRWA wrote on X. In response, the IDF shared a satellite image of what it claimed were Hamas-controlled fuel supplies. “These fuel tanks are inside Gaza,” it wrote. “They contain more than 500,000 litres of fuel. Ask Hamas if you can have some.” Although dozens of trucks carrying desperately-needed aid began entering Gaza at the weekend following a US-brokered deal, there were no deliveries on Tuesday, an AFP correspondent at the Rafah border crossing said. The World Health Organization (WHO) also said fuel supplies were critically low. The WHO, which works through UNRWA, said it delivered 34,000 litres of fuel on Monday to four hospitals and the Palestine Red Crescent. That amount was only enough to keep ambulances and critical hospital functions running for just over 24 hours, theTimes of Israelreports. Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the Hamas-run health ministry, claimed the Gaza Strip was hours away from no longer being able to provide any medical services. “We have reached the stage of complete collapse,” he told Al Jazeera. UN figures show more than 1.4 million people — out of a total population of 2.4 million — have been displaced within Gaza since the war began, with nearly 590,000 people taking shelter in its schools. Hostage with arm blown off dragged away Horrifyingfootage surfacedon Tuesday showing American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin looking dazed and shocked just moments after Hamas terrorists blew off his arm. The bone from the young man’s mangled left limb was visibly protruding when he pulled himself into the bed of a truck under gunpoint by Hamas terrorists shortly after they opened fire at the Tribe of Nova music festival in the southern Negev on the morning of October 7, according tovideo releasedby CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Mr Goldberg-Polin’s arm was blown off when the terrorists lobbed a grenade into a shelter that the festival-goer was taking refuge in during the carnage. The disturbing footage — which Cooper’s team filmed off the phone of an Israeli soldier who later arrived at the scene — showed several Hamas fighters dragging three other men into the truck with Mr Goldberg-Polin before driving back into Gaza. Cooper said he realised he had possible footage of Mr Goldberg-Polin’s capture while doing a live remote interview with the 23-year-old’s parents, Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, last week. He later sent the parents the footage, and they confirmed that the bleeding, stunned-looking young man was indeed their missing son. “As horrible as it is as a parent to your kid under gunpoint, with one arm … the composure with which he’s walking on his own legs, pulling himself with his one weak hand onto the truck, gave me a real dose of strength,” Mr Polin told Cooper. — NY Post ‘Not showing’: Brutal truth of hostage release Israel has urged the world not to be “manipulated” by Hamas after the Palestinian terror group released two more hostages this week. Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and Nurit Cooper, 79, were released on Monday after more than two weeks in captivity. Both of their octogenarian husbands are still in Gaza. Hamas has now freed four women following the release of an American mother and daughter, Judith Tai Raanan and Natalie Raanan, 17, on Friday, for “humanitarian reasons”. “This is how Hamas manipulates the world,” the IDF captioned a video on X. “They keep 222 civilians hostage and then make the world believe they are humane. The worst part is, the world believes.” In the video, the IDF urged viewers not to lose sight of the horrific October 7 invasion of southern Israel by Hamas terrorists, who massacred, mutilated, raped and burnt alive more than 1400 people and took hundreds hostage. “Three weeks before being served coffee for the cameras, these 80-year-old women were brutally abducted from their homes and held hostage in Gaza,” the video said. “Two may have been released, but 222 are still held hostage. Don’t let Hamas manipulate you.” PM insists ground offensive ‘is coming’ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told troops that the ground offensive into Gaza “is coming”, despite growing signs the long-awaited invasion has stalled. Mr Netanyahu made the comments on a visit to the IDF’s Yahalom Unit, a special unit of the Combat Engineering Corps, according to a press release from his office on Tuesday. “I want to tell you where we are at the moment,” he told the troops. “We are striking the enemy with great force. Yesterday, in our attacks in Gaza, we struck the enemy the harshest blow they have taken in a single day. We killed dozens of terrorists, possibly even more. At this very moment, we are clarifying the exact magnitude of the strike. However, we also know that even as we are active in additional sectors in the north, we are hitting whoever tries to attack us, in Judea and Samaria as well. “We stand before the next stage, it is coming. You know it and you are part of it — you are part of the vanguard. I greatly appreciate what you know how to do, your fighting spirit, your readiness to save our country from these animals, and I am certain that you will succeed. “We have only one mission — to smash Hamas. We will not stop until we complete it, with your help. I rely on you — the people of Israel rely on you. I am proud of you and I salute you.” Why Israel hasn’t invaded yet Israel has not launched a ground invasion of Gaza, despite announcing its imminence, a delay media reports and experts attribute to international pressure, political-military divisions and concerns over hostages. Eighteen days after the deadliest attack ever launched into Israel by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas that rules Gaza, the Israeli military is relentlessly pounding the territory. But apart from some relatively minor incursions, the much-vaunted land offensive has not been unleashed. “There’s a crisis of confidence between [Israeli Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF,” noted editorial writer Nahum Barnea in the dailyYedioth Ahronoth. “The government is having difficulties taking decisions that everyone agrees on about the top issues.” According to government and military sources cited by Barnea, “Netanyahu is angry at the generals and blames them for what happened” during what Israelis are calling “the October 7 fiasco”. Unanimity has brought together the left and right wings of mainstream Israeli politics. “Disputes over these operations are creating tensions, especially between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant,” wrote columnist Amos Harel in Tuesday’s left-leaningHaaretzdaily. State radio noted “dissent between the premier and senior ranks in the military”, with mutual accusations of failing to prevent the bloody attack by Hamas militants. Commentators say the fact that official statements often mention convergence of views at the highest level means the opposite, revealing the artificial nature of a united front. “The Prime Minister, the Defence Minister and the IDF chief of staff are working in close and full co-operation, around the clock, to lead the State of Israel to a decisive victory over Hamas,” said a communique on Tuesday from the Government Press Office. “There is total and mutual trust between the Prime Minister, the Defence Minister and the IDF chief of staff — the unity of the goal is clear.” Patrick Bettane, an intelligence specialist at Israel’s International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) think tank, confirmed “disagreement about a ground offensive”. “But the fact that there are hostages being held in the Gaza Strip complicates everything,” he said. “Israel is waiting to see how this problem can be resolved before it acts.” Relatives of those seized and taken to Gaza have staged daily demonstrations outside Mr Gallant’s home in Tel Aviv. Akiva Eldar, an expert on Israeli politics, asserted that “after the emotions aroused by this terrible massacre, Bibi [Netanyahu] and the generals are starting to think differently”. He said the presence in Israel of US military personnel was aimed at preventing any move that could mean the death of hostages, including Americans. Political analyst Daniel Bensimon said, “Disagreement or not, it’s a fact that Americans and the Europeans are coming to Israel to caress it with honeyed words with the aim of preventing a ground offensive.” Israel calls on UN head to resign The Israeli ambassador to the United Nations has called on the head of the international body to resign. The demand came after UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said “humanitarian law” was being broken in Gaza and that the Hamas attacks that killed more than 1000 Israelis did not occur in a “vacuum”. Israel’s ambassador Gilad Erdan said Mr Guterres had shown “understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children, women, and the elderly,” and so was “not fit to lead the UN”. “I call on him to resign immediately,” said Mr Erdan. “There is no justification or point in talking to those who show compassion for the most terrible atrocities committed against the citizens of Israel and the Jewish people.” Israel’s foreign minister has now said he will refuse to meet with Mr Guterres. “After the October 7th massacre, there is no place for a balanced approach. Hamas must be erased off the face of the planet!” Eli Cohen wrote on Twitter, now called X. The row erupted at a meeting of the UN Security Council in New York on Tuesday where Mr Guterres said: “The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their lands steadily devolved by settlements and plagued by violence. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.” However, he added that it could not justify “the appalling attacks by Hamas”. Mr Guterres added that there had been “clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza”. He called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire Sydney council to fly Palestinian flag A Sydney council will fly the Palestinian flag until a cease fire is declared — but the same gesture will not be extended to the flag of Israel. Canterbury-Bankstown Council, in Sydney’s south west, will fly the Palestinian flag from its main administration building in Campsie and at Paul Keating Park in Bankstown. Labor councillor Karl Saleh introduced the motion at Tuesday evening’s council meeting “in support of the Palestinian people” until “a cease fire is declared”. “Of course we have no place for anti-Semitism or Islamophobia in our city but let’s not pretend that the Palestinians have only been suffering since the 7th of October this year.” NSW Jewish Board of Deputies president David Ossip told theCanterbury-Bankstown Expressthe move could harm “community cohesion”. “An act of support for Palestinian civilians caught up in Hamas’ war is understandable but without also condemning the Hamas terror regime, you’re just giving comfort and support to Hamas who have proven to be worse than ISIS”. ‘They will pay’: Top Israeli general speaks In new remarks, the chief of staff of the IDF, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, has said that: “Israel is in the midst of a war that was launched by the Hamas terror group. (Hamas) already regrets it”. “We are making use of every minute to be even more prepared. And every minute that passes on the other side, we strike the enemy even more. Killing terrorists, destroying infrastructure, collecting more intelligence for the next stage. “This war has one address: the Hamas leadership and all those who acted under its command. They will pay the price for what they did.” Gen Halevi said the IDF was fighting Hamas, not “Gaza’s populace”, and that Israel wanted Gaza’s residents to remain “as unharmed as possible”. ‘Didn’t take it seriously’: Hostage lashes IDF There is something else worth noting from the remarks of freed Israeli hostage Yocheved Lifschitz, beyond her description of the “hell” she went through in Hamas custody: she accused the IDF of failing to take the threat from Hamas seriously. Ahead of the October 7 incursion, she said, Hamas had issued a warning by sending “balloons with fire and burning our fields”. “The IDF didn’t take that seriously,” Ms Lifschitz said. Israel’s military response to Hamas is one aspect of this story. But as time passes, massive questions will be asked about how the IDF and Israel’s intelligence apparatuses allowed itself to be so catastrophically blindsided. ‘Dangerous juncture’: Global turmoil looms The war between Israel and Hamas could deal a terrible blow to the global economy, leading figures in the banking industry said at a forum in Saudi Arabia today. “What’s just happened recently in Israel and Gaza – at the end of the day, you put all this together, and I think the impact on economic development is even more serious,” said the President of the World Bank, Ajay Banga. “I think we’re at a very dangerous juncture.” Among the chief risks is that the war draws in other countries, most likely Lebanon, in which the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah wields immense influence. “If these things are not resolved, it probably means more global terrorism, which means more insecurity, which means more of society is going to be fearful. Less hope. And when there is less hope, we see contractions in our economies,” said Larry Fink CEO of Blackrock. So throw global economic instability into the soup of potential problems here. Bold suggestion for alliance against Hamas French President Emmanuel Macron was the latest Western leader to visit Israel today. He came armed with a bold suggestion: the formation of an international coalition to fight Hamas, similar to the one that was formed to battle the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Indeed he proposed that the existing Global Coalition against Daesh (an alternative name for ISIS) “should also fight against Hamas”. “We should build a regional and international coalition to battle against terrorist groups that threaten us all,” said Mr Macron. The anti-ISIS coalition has 86 members, which include both countries and broader groups like the European Union and Arab League. However he cautioned that any conflict should be conducted under international law. “The fight must be without mercy, but not without rules,” Mr Macron said. “Because we are democracies which fight against terrorists, democracies which respect the right to war and assure humanitarian access.” He also appeared to push Israel towards launching “targeted operations” instead of the full-scale ground invasion of Gaza that’s widely anticipated. And Mr Macron said the “first objective” must be “the release of all hostages”. He spoke of the need to “relaunch” the peace process with Palestinians, saying “the Palestinian cause must be heard with reason” and “Israel’s security cannot be sustainable” otherwise. Speaking alongside the French President, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared Israel’s situation to having “ISIS in the suburbs of Paris”. “We cannot live like that,” he said. A third of Gaza’s hospitals stop functioning The World Health Organisation says nearly two-thirds of all the health facilities in Gaza have stopped functioning amid Israel’s continuing bombardment of the Strip. The WHO identified 72 such facilities, 46 of which have ceased to function. Among them are 12 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals. The crisis is being blamed not just on the damage from air strikes but on the Strip being starved of fuel and electricity by Israel. Palestinian death toll rises further Gaza’s health ministry, which is run by Hamas, says the Palestinian death toll has risen to 5,791, including 2,360 children. It claims that 704 Palestinians were killed in the last 24 hours. The figures have not been independently verified. Hostage reveals life as Hamas captive An 85-year-old woman taken hostage by Hamas said she had “been through hell” but described some of her Hamas captors as surprisingly “gentle”. Yocheved Lifschitz was visibly shaken as she fronted the press on Tuesday, explaining her husband was still a hostage inside Gaza. Her daughter Sharone said she had been beaten with sticks and forced to walk kilometres on wet ground after being taken by Hamas militants on a motorbike on October 7. Lifschitz said that captives are being forced to sleep on mattresses in tunnels, but admitted Hamas had treated her “gently” with a paramedic regularly coming to bring he medicine. “They gave us pitta bread, hard cheese, some low fat cream cheese and cucumber and that was our food for the entire day,” she said, adding that the militant group was “really prepared” for the situation. She also claimed Hamas had sent a warning weeks before the October 7 attacks, sending “balloons with fire and burning our fields”. “The IDF didn’t take that seriously,” she said. Hostage rescue groups continue to operate by the minute but information is patchy. “My father is there. There’s so many other people. We’re waiting for good news about everyone. My heart is with all my friends and loved ones,” Sharone said. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Aussie wine bar’s ‘venomous’ sign slammed,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/dumb-white-dogs-melbourne-radio-station-and-wine-bar-under-fire-for-propalestine-protest-bannermaking-event/news-story/1e720ba5cfd086acd91af04f2e7a86b1,"A Melbourne wine bar and community radio station have come under fire for hosting a pro-Palestine event that saw participants make protest banners describing Israelis as “dumb white dogs”. Indigenous group This Mob Arts Collective organised the banner-making workshop atHope St Radioon Monday afternoon, ahead of a protest schedule for later today. The community station is based in a wine bar and restaurant within an arts and community hub called Collingwood Yards in the city’s inner north. Images from the event show signs being painted that have now been deemed offensive by members of Melbourne’s Jewish community. One reads: “Free Palestine from the colonising dumb white dogs!! Abolish Israel!! Pussy ass baby killing bitch ass Bibi.” Bibi is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s nickname. Dvir Abramovich, chair of the Anti-Defamation Commission, slammed the poster’s open call for the “destruction of the Jewish state”. “I never thought I would see such hate-fuelled events taking place in the country that I love, and the ripple effects of such demonisation are being felt deeply by us,” Dr Abramovich said. “This venomous poster, calling for Israel to be erased, fans the flames of hostility at a dangerous time when anti-Semitism in Australia is skyrocketing, when young Jewish students are being called ‘bombers’ and are harassed schools and when Jews are singled out for abuse online. “Words matter and such incitement can lead to verbal and physical attacks and those who crafted the banner bear responsibility. “It is hard to escape the conclusion that these individuals are excusing the beheading of Israeli babies, the raping of women and the execution of entire families by the Hamas terrorists. This is demonisation of the worst kind and deserves condemnation.” An image of the banner was shared on X, formerly Twitter, by Peter Horovitz – a Melbourne-based management consultant who describes himself as a “proud Zionist and fighter of anti-Semitism”. “Just a wine bar in Collingwood calling for the destruction of #Israel and the extermination of 7m #Jews,” Mr Horovitz wrote. “It’s called Hope St Radio. I won’t be going.” Other banners made carried the pro-Palestine slogan “from the river to the sea”, which refers to the goal of liberating the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. When the images of the “dumb white dog” and “abolish Israel” remarks began circulating online, Hope St Radio issued a statement in response to “a number of reviews and messages accusing us of anti-Semitism”. “Hope St Radio should be a place that all people feel welcome and safe,” it read. “Many members of our immediate and more broad communities are Jewish and we treasure our relationships with them. Hope St Radio whole heartedly condemns antisemitism, Islamophobia, and all racism, bigotry and systems of oppression. “This is why we are proud to stand in solidarity with our First Nations neighbours, with our grieving Arab and Jewish friends, and with all of those calling for an end to the violence in occupied Palestine.” Dr Abramovich said the “so-called apology” was “deeply disappointing”. “You cannot reject anti-Semitism while not rejecting the poisonous sentiments of the banner. How do they expect their Jewish employees to feel safe in the workplace. This is not good enough.” Hope St Radio’s statement sparked upset in the comments, with one asking how Hope St’s Jewish staff might feel “about coming to work now knowing that you supported these ‘paintings’”. “Food has this wonderful ability to bring people together,” another wrote. “A missed opportunity to create an event that called for peace, unity and open/ safe conversation. The last thing we need is division – especially were we eat.” Another said: “Really disappointed. This apology is as dry as your cheesecake.” Some others in the comments were supportive and expressed solidarity with the cause. The Hamas-Israel conflict and pro-Palestine protests in Australia have heightened tensions here, with Dr Abramovich receiving multiple reports of threats, intimidation and violence against Jewish people. “In the 37 years I’ve lived in Australia, I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. “I never thought I’d see these kinds of things – people chanting ‘gas the Jews’ and open calls for the destruction of Israel. “People are afraid. They’re very afraid to be Jewish at the moment.” The Anti-Defamation Commission has received multiple reports of mezuzahs being ripped from the doorframes of Jewish front doors in Melbourne in recent weeks. A mezuzah is a small case that contains a tiny scroll of parchment inscribed with a prayer from the Torah and is hung on the doors of homes. “It’s a symbol of Jewish faith and is a hallmark of a Jewish home,” Dr Abramovich said. “It’s either their neighbours or people walking around Jewish neighbourhoods looking for them.”  This Mob promoted the banner-making workshop on its social media channels, writing: “Here and in Palestine, Indigenous peoples are mourning the ongoing and unrelenting violence of settler colonialism. “As Indigenous peoples, we are united with our Palestinian siblings in our collective fights against settler colonialism. Following the controversy, it called for its supporters to “go and show Hope St some love”. “They’re so supportive of us and are copping it for hosting our banner painting,” an Instagram story read. A post sharing the image on Reddit quickly went viral, with commenters slamming the conduct of attendees. “White privilege on its finest display,” one wrote. “You get to make uneducated historical statements, from such a comfortable position and face little to no repercussion for it.” “61% of the Israeli Jewish population are descendants from Mizrahi Jews, the ones exiled from Arab nations from the 1940s to 1950s,” another said. “So the idea that all Jewish Israelis are European ‘colonialists’ is comical. “Not to mention 20% of Israeli citizens are Arabs with full citizenship rights as any other Israeli. Seriously so many uninformed people.” This afternoon’s protest is organised by Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance and Free Palestine Melbourne and will take place on the steps of Victoria’s Parliament at 4pm. “Around the world First Nations communities and Palestinian communities are hurting,” the groups wrote. “But in the face of ongoing injustice and genocide, we will not be silent. We will come together. We will rise up condemn Israel‘s ongoing genocide and Australia’s complicity and support of Israel.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Reason hostage shook hands with captor,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/reason-hamas-hostage-shook-hands-with-captor/news-story/976b785f9531895e40feb552881de03e,"An 85-year-old Israeli woman was seen shaking hands with her Hamas captor after she was freed by the militant group on Monday. In video footage released by Hamas, Yocheved Lifshitz is seen being led away from Hamas soldiers by two Red Cross workers who tell her, “It’s OK. Let’s go”. After walking with the workers for a few steps, she turns back to one of the masked militants and pauses to shake his hand. “Shalom,” she said, meaning hello, goodbye and peace in Hebrew. When later asked by reporters why she turned back to shake his hand, Ms Lifshitz said her captors had treated her with “with softness and supplied all our needs”. Following her release, the 85-year-old, who was freed along with 79-year-old Nurit Cooper, said she “went through hell” during her abduction but had been treated well while held captive in Gaza. The gunmen “beat me on the way, they didn’t break my ribs but hurt me very much”, she said. Mr Lifschitz said a paramedic regularly came to bring her medicine while held hostage and captives are being forced to sleep on mattresses in tunnels. “They gave us pitta bread, hard cheese, some low fat cream cheese and cucumber and that was our food for the entire day,” she said, adding that the militant group was “really prepared” for the situation. She also claimed Hamas had sent a warning weeks before the October 7 attacks, sending “balloons with fire and burning our fields”. “The IDF didn’t take that seriously,” she said. Hamas still holds the elderly husbands of Lifshitz and Cooper, among more than 200 other hostages. The release of the two Israelis comes three days after that of an American woman and her teenage daughter. The Hamas-run health ministry said 5,791 Palestinians have been killed since the war started, 2,360 of them children. In Israel, over 1,400 people have been killed. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned it would be forced to stop working in Gaza unless fuel deliveries were made to the territory by Wednesday. “Time is running out. We urgently need fuel,” said UNRWA communications director Juliette Touma. Six Gaza hospitals have already had to shut down because of a lack of fuel, the World Health Organisation said. A small number of aid trucks have entered Gaza since the weekend, but they are only a fraction of the usual flow across the border. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Suburb’s controversial move on Palestine,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/canterburybankstown-council-votes-to-fly-palestine-flag-in-support-of-gaza-residents/news-story/751e009514e4b81ea92a2434f6564d76,"A Sydney council has unanimously agreed to show their support for the residents of Gaza and fly the Palestinian flag. Canterbury-Bankstown council has voted to raise the flag over Paul Keating Park in Bankstown and the Campsie administration building until a ceasefire is declared in Palestine. Labor councillor Karl Saleh tabled the motion at Tuesday night’s council meeting as a “mark of respect” and to “convey their condolences” to the more than 5000 Palestinians killed in the conflict. “The media often ask, do we condemn all acts of violence targeting civilians and of course we condemn terrorism and violence in any form,” he said. “Of course we have no place for anti-Semitism or Islamophobia in our city but let’s not pretend that the Palestinians have only been suffering since the seventh of October this year.” He also suggested plans to create a space at the park close to the flagpoles where locals can pay their respects by laying wreaths and flowers. The move comes as another Sydney council backflips on its decision to fly the Palestinian flag as part of honouring International Day of Solidarity in November. Randwick councillor Daniel Rosenfeld brought forward the urgent motion to reverse the decision after the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, fearing it would be disrespectful to the area’s large Jewish community. “Hamas atrocities really deeply affected the Jewish community,” he said during Monday night’s council meeting. “Fourteen-hundred people of my fellow Jewish persons were slaughtered on October 7, 200 more were abducted.” A ﻿fierce debate ensued and the motion was opposed by the mayor and three councillors. Mr Rosenfeld, whose grandparents were Holocaust survivors, said the recent pro-Palestine protests in Australia had caused anguish for many Jewish people, including himself. Randwick council area is home to two synagogues, a Jewish high school, primary school and an aged-care provider. The council held a minute’s silence at the end of the meeting in honour of all those affected by the war, including the Palestinian community. A landmark green energy scheme to keep the lights on as ageing coal fired power generation exits the grid has been unveiled, but the government reveal how much the scheme will cost.

Aussie soldiers deployed to Middle East,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/australia-to-deploy-additional-adf-personnel-and-aircraft-to-the-middleeast/news-story/0e3a831aec58b9dbe8ffef2bfff1c47b,"The government will deploy more Australian military forces to the Middle East in response to the deepening war crisis in Gaza. Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles announced on Wednesday two additional RAAF planes and a small detachment of army personnel has been flown to the region as a precautionary measure. “We're not saying we’re in the Middle East for operational reasons, but we are putting that in place, really, as a contingency to support Australian populations,” Mr Marles said on the Today show. “Bearing in mind that this is a very volatile situation and we just don't absolutely know which way it goes from here.” Mr Marles did not confirm specific details but said a “significant number” of additional defence force personnel has been sent to an undisclosed location. He said two extra Royal Australian Air Force planes, a C-17 aircraft and a KC 30 tanker refueller, have been sent to help evacuatecivilians stuck in the region. This comes after four Australians were rescued after crossing the Palestinian border from the West Bank into Jordan overnight. About 79 Australian citizens are now awaiting rescue from Gaza, according to the Acting Prime Minister. “I think the message I really want to give today is that if you are in the area in a place like Lebanon, for example, and you are looking and want to leave, you should be taking all the options that are available to you now,” Mr Marles said. “The people we’re really concerned about are those in Gaza, where it’s a much, much more difficult situation. We’re urging those people to move south.” “We’re working with the international community to try and establish that humanitarian corridor that we‘ve seen operating in terms of getting humanitarian goods in to Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.” The chief of the ADF, General Angus Campbell, warned the conflict was in its early stages. “The conflict that we see between Israel and Hamas appears to be in its early stages, and we want to be well-positioned,” he said. “I would very much encourage Australians to follow DFAT’s advisories in regard to travel and to pay attention to their safety.” More than 700 Palestinians were killed in overnight Israeli air raids on Gaza on Tuesday, according Palestine’s Health Ministry. United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths made a plea for additional aid for civilians trapped in the area overnight, posting on social media that supplies were “barely making a dent.” This comes as Israel’s military continues to signal a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip after Hamas fighters killed at least 1,400 people in a surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7. Mr Marles affirmed Australia’s stance of supporting Israel’s right to defend itself. “We do respect and acknowledge that Israel has a right to defend itself and to move against Hamas. We've been making that clear from the very beginning,” he said. “Obviously, in doing that, we urge Israel to adhere to the rules of war ... and make the protection of civilian life front and centre in all that they do.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Fears of arson attacks on Aussie mosques,https://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/sa-police-investigate-alleged-arson-attacks-on-adelaide-mosques/news-story/f2a3c7fd0a41d394efeabe7fe9cbdb03,"Foreign Minister Penny Wong has called on Australians to stand against Islamophobia after two suspected arson attacks hit two mosques in South Australia over the past week. The most recent incident occurred at 2am on Monday when a gas cylinder was set on fire outside the Al-Khalil Mosque in Adelaide’s north. The Islamic Society of South Australia confirmed the incident and said it had been reported to the police. “Such actions are entirely unacceptable and we are aware that the wider community strongly condemns these cowardly acts,” the society said. The Islamic representative body said an earlier attack hit the Marion Mosque on October 19 when two grass fires were lit on Condada Avenue, which runs alongside the house of worship. No one was injured in either incident. A South Australian police spokesman confirmed the police were investigating the two fires. “Police are investigating the fires but do not believe that the fires are linked and do not believe that they are racially motivated at this time,” the spokesman said. It is believed the grass fires at Marion were deliberately lit. Senator Wong, in a Twitter post on Tuesday evening, said she was “appalled” by the reports of the alleged arson attacks. “All of us, including every political leader, must stand together against Islamophobia,” she said. “We all have a responsibility to call out discrimination, hate speech and prejudice wherever we see it.” Tensions have flared across Australia in response to the escalating violence in Israel and Palestine following terror group Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians on October 7. Some pro-Palestine protests held in the wake of the war have been marred by anti-Semitic chants. A young boy is one of four people injured after a car ploughed into the front of a pizza shop, leaving one person with serious injuries in hospital.

‘No sense’ for so many post offices: Aus Post,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/abc-reveals-investigation-into-controversial-reporter-tom-joyner/news-story/1c4cab7b16e084c2aefad0aa1e3a3a4b,"The head of Australia Post says it makes “no sense” for the institution to keep open the same number of post offices it had 34 years ago, as fewer Australians send and receive letters. Paul Graham, appearing before Senate estimates on Tuesday night, said the agency was currently running a “two speed business” where its parcels services were performing well, but the decreasing need for letters risked further burdening the business. The company posted a $200m loss in the 2022-23 financial year, only the second loss since 1989. Mr Graham said the agency’s ability to remain relevant had “been challenged like never before”, and warned that without regulatory support, Australia Post would need taxpayer funding to stay afloat. He called on the government to update regulation that has remained unchanged since 1989, requiring there be at least 4000 post offices across the country, 2500 of which must be in rural and regional Australia. Mr Graham said as it stood, there were 4271 post offices across the country, with most of the metropolitan outlets experiencing overlap. He said that the business did not think that number was “appropriate” and outlined the “significant challenges” of those outlets’ long term sustainability. “We will never abandon the regions and rural Australia, but it makes no sense for Australia Post to keep the same number of post offices where there is a clear oversupply and where customers are simply not using the service,” Mr Graham said. “For example, in Camberwell, in Victoria, there are 84 post offices in a 7.5km radius … The number of post offices in our major cities is not sustainable or sensible.” He said the minimum number of post office outlets was set in 1989, before the internet boom. “Most Australians no longer visit the post office, but we are required by regulation to operate a network larger than all the supermarkets combined,” he said. “It’s easier to buy a postage stamp than a loaf of bread.” He said the “good news” was that, “collectively, we have a great opportunity to turn this 214 year old business around and have success over the long term … without the need for government funding. “We’re focused on doing everything in our power to improve our business … We will return to profit … We’re doing everything within our control to build a sustainable business.” Earlier, the ABC confirmed the journalist who caused a media firestorm after dismissing reports of Jewish babies being beheaded by Hamas terrorists is no longer in Israel and is under investigation. ABC director David Anderson, who appeared before the Communications Legislation estimates hearing on Tuesday, confirmed the broadcaster had launched an internal investigation into Tom Joyner’s conduct in the Middle East after he sent a text to several hundred other journalists in Israel that read: “the story about the babies is bulls**t”. The Israeli Defence Force later confirmed Hamas terrorists had slaughtered and beheaded babies in their October 7 terror assault. “I know that Mr Joyner is quite remorseful and apologetic for the words that he used,” Mr Anderson said under questioning from NSW Liberal Senator Hollie Hughes. He later revealed Mr Joyner has been “rotated” out of Israel and was taking a break before returning to his usual post in Istanbul. “He was at the time trying to do what journalists were doing, he was trying to verify what sources could back up what claims were being made at the time,” Mr Anderson said. Mr Anderson said the ABC had contacted the IDF to confirm the shocking report, but the Israeli military could not verify the report at the time of contact. Mr Anderson said Mr Joyner’s message had caused “distress” but he would have a right to “procedural fairness” in the investigation. “My Joyner does have a right of reply here when we do look at it,” he said. “I am sorry that it happened.” Senator Hughes suggested in her questioning of Mr Anderson the ABC’s coverage of Israel contained an anti-Semitic bias, something Mr Anderson roundly rejected. “I do not think the ABC is anti-Semitic in any way,” he said. “We are impartially reporting what info we have available at the time.” Senator Hughes blasted a 7.30 interview with Hamas terrorist Dr Basem Naim from October 17, saying she had “zero comprehension” why the ABC had platformed a prescribed terrorist and suggested the public broadcaster had “legitimised” a terrorist. “It is not legitimising terrorism,” Mr Anderson said. “One of their lies was that they didn’t harm Israelis. “Through that interview, we challenged them and they admitted that they had done that. “This is editorially justified to interview that representative given the heinous act that they did, to challenge them on the claims and the misinformation they spread.” The ABC spent more than $150,000 in flights, accommodation and taxis to send 37 staff to Garma Festival in remote northeastern Arnhem Land in August. ABC chief financial officer Melanie Kleyn said the broadcaster had spent less in 2023 than it had the year prior, when 38 staff had gone to the tune of $186,000. Ms Kleyn said the dozens of staff had been necessary to broadcast programs including Q+A and Insiders. The national broadcaster will carry out two reviews of its Voice to Parliament referendum coverage, Mr Anderson confirmed to estimates. One review will include external reviewers to assess the ABC’s coverage and “give their assessment”, similar to what happens after a federal election. “The other sort of review we’ll do is within the ABC, what learnings did we have from it,” Mr Anderson said. On the night of the referendum, the broadcaster reached an audience of 3 million people. “It was, I think, the go to coverage on the night, I think it was outstanding … it was impartial,” Mr Anderson said. “Throughout that period, I’ll just say our coverage was outstanding. “We were reaching people in regional, rural and remote areas like no other media organisation to gain those perspectives.” Mr Anderson has refused to apologise to former Australian commando Heston Russell after a judge found ABC journalists had defamed the veteran as a war criminal. Justice Michael Lee has awarded Mr Heston more than $412,315 in damages after the commando won his battle in court against ABC articles surrounding the death of an Afghan prisoner in 2012. Mr Anderson said the ABC was still considering its options during the 28-day appeal window. “I am not going to apologise to Mr Russell,” he said. “It was the first time we have tested a public interest defence in defamation, there is a lot to learn from it. “Whatever happens here, appeal or not, there is a lot to learn from the ABC’s perspective.” Mr Anderson said it was not the intention of the ABC to “damage anyone” but the broadcaster had a responsibility to hold people to account, including Australian Defence Force personnel. “As an agency head, I am going to take legal advice on what to do next,” he said. “As you have pointed out, we have spent a lot of money on this and I want the legal advice on what we do next.” The ABC has spent some $800,000 in legal fees on the case in addition to Mr Heston’s $400,000 payout. Victorian Liberal Senator Sarah Henderson blasted the ABC’s legal representation and the judgment of news director Justin Stevens, but Mr Anderson defended Mr Stevens as an “excellent director” of news. The Daily Telegraph has reported the ABC’s source for the articles, a former US Marine, apologised to Mr Russell on Monday. Later in the day, the Australian Communications and Media Authority confirmed to the committee that almost 10,000 Australians – the vast majority of whom are under the age of 40 – have signed up to self-exclude from gambling websites. BetStop was launched by the federal government two months ago, and requires wagering providers to close the betting accounts of people who have registered for self-exclusion. Under the legislation, wagering providers cannot let registered people bet or open a new account, nor can they send marketing messages to anyone on the register. ACMA char Nerida O’Loughlin told the committee the “vast majority” of those who’d already signed up had registered to be excluded from betting sites for life. ﻿“We’re seeing this combination of younger people excluding for life, which we think really explains the importance of this initiative, particularly for younger Australians, who want to be in more control of their gambling,” she said. She noted people were also registering for a support person to help them stop gambling. She told the committee the focus was now on ensuring industry complied with the register.

Driver’s surprise pro-Palestine move on train,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/we-love-you-all-heres-a-song-for-you-guys-shock-as-train-driver-plays-banned-propalestine-song-on-loudspeaker/news-story/4735c2bf178da3972f83440289b79e55,"Footage has captured the moment a pro-Palestinian protest song was played over a Sydney train’s loudspeakers as the driver announces “we love you all, here’s a song for you guys”. Some commuters reacted with delight as Dammi Falastini, a song by Arab Idol winner Mohammed Assaf, was played following Australian protests against the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict at the weekend. But Jewish leaders have voiced their outrage at the footage, with Australia’s peak body for Jewish representation calling for the train driver to be sacked. Thousands of people gathered in the country’s capital cities in support of Palestine on Saturday amid ongoing violence in the Gaza Strip. In the footage, posted to TikTok, the driver is heard announcing to passengers: “We love you all. Here’s a song for you guys.” He then plays Dammi Falastini, a song widely considered to be an ode to Palestinian resistance against Israeli military occupation while expressing Mr Assaf’s Palestinian heritage and identity. The song was removed from Spotify and Apple Music earlier this year to uproar from fans. A group of women appear ecstatic and begin smiling, even bobbing their heads along with the music as they headed to Sydney’s Town Hall. “The train driver made our day,” the video’s description reads. In another video, more passengers are seen laughing when the song is suddenly played on the train. A Sydney Trains spokeswoman said: “Sydney Trains is aware of the circulating videos on social media and we are looking into this matter.” The Australian Jewish Association’s (AJA) chief executive Robert Gregory called for the train driver to be sacked for “political advocacy on the taxpayer’s dollar”. “After the worst massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust, some have taken to celebrating and calling for more violence,” he claimed. Mr Robert claimed the rallies over the weekend included “incitement to violence and anti-Semitism”. “Sydney’s public transport is for everyone not for political activism and we call on the NSW Government to take action immediately,” he said. Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have begun bombing Gaza in retribution for recent attacks by the Islamist militant movement Hamas, which has killed more than 1400 people since October 7. The escalating violence has increased the Palestinian death toll to 5087, including 2055 children. A further 15,273 people have been injured, local health authorities say. Hamas is still keeping some 200 hostages, Israeli media say. The weekend’s protests in Australia were held in response to the response by Israel and the IDF, with world leaders now weighing in to find a solution to the conflict. The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) on Saturday urged Australians to unite their voices in a call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Authorities have warned of “heavy” traffic and delays in a popular tourist strip after a multi-vehicle accident, believed to have involved a luxury car, forced the road to close.

Tiny nation that could prevent major war,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/qatar-the-tiny-nation-that-could-prevent-major-war-between-israel-and-hamas/news-story/8e2c07054ea9da14979b9c334689caea,"Among all the nations central to brokering the release of four hostages captured by Hamas – one tiny country has played an outsized role. Qatar, the gas-rich Gulf state that hosted the men’s football World Cup in 2022, has a measly population of 2.7 million and land mass smaller than Sydney. However, its influence on the broader world has been under the spotlight for years – leading to a crisis between Qatar and the Arab League between 2017 and 2021. It began when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed their bilateral relations with Qatar and subsequently banned Qatar-registered aircraft and Qatari ships from using their sovereign territory by air, land, and sea. Australia’s relationship with Qatar alsoremains strainedafter numerous Australian women were invasively stripsearched at a Qatari airport in 2020. However, that hasn’t stopped other countries cosying up to the tiny country – which is protected by 11,000 US troops stationed at Doha – on the Persian Gulf. And for good reason. Over the weekend, an American mother and daughter were released through Qatar’s hostage diplomacy and on Monday two Israeli grandmothers were also released — serving as a rare bit of good news among all the carnage. Qatar as the middleman According to theNew York Timesin the hours after Hamas began its devastating attack on October 7, US secretary of state Antony Blinken called Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani with the hope that the nation could play the role of middleman between Hamas and the US. After the release of the two women over the weekend, President Joe Biden acknowledged so much, profusely thanking “the government of Qatar” in a statement. Meanwhile, media were told today the two elderly Israeli hostages were released in a deal brokered by Qatar on Monday. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has now subsequently reached out to Qatar’s leaders for help with UK hostages. Why Qatar? Professor Sally Totman from Charles Sturt University described the role of Qatar as “very significant” in negotiations. “No other country has managed to do what they have done,” she told news.com.au. She said she “wasn’t surprised” by the involvement of Qatar due to their “long history of involvement with Hamas” as well as a growing relationship with the US. She said in the short-term, the hostage situation could lead to a greater reliance of the US and UK on Qatar. However, in the long-term there would be questions about why Qatar hasn’t put more pressure on Hamas not to engage in terrorism. Qatar has long had a close relationship to Hamas, hosting its political officers in Doha as well as funnelling hundreds of millions of dollars to the militant group, supposedly to help authorities in Gaza pay for fuel, electricity and public sector wages Mamoun Fandy, the president of the London Global Strategy Institute, told theSunday Timesthe successful hostage negotiations allowed Qatar to show it is “the hub of diplomacy in this crisis”. It also vindicated its relationship with political parties that other nations might shun. Strategy behind hostage release Some say Hamas is trying to put pressure on both the international community and Israel not to proceed with a ground invasion of Gaza. A diplomat involved in the negotiations toldNBCthere were “ups and downs” during discussions. Ultimately, hostages walked free because Qatari negotiators were able to convince Hamas that the unconditional release of hostages could serve as a confidence-building measure. Qatar says its efforts could lead to more hostages being released “very soon” but Prof Totman said it was “highly doubtful” it would prevent Israeli military troops from entering Gaza given the scale of Hamas’ brutality. She told news.com.au the hold-up in military action is likely because “a lot is going on in the background” as Israel prepares to fight a war on two fronts – against Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza strip. carla.mascarenhas@news.com.au To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Greens leader called out over Hamas,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/a-jewish-man-has-accused-the-greens-of-not-condemning-hamas-over-the-gaza-attack/news-story/395062912919e9819209d32206954a76,"Greens leader Adam Bandt has been called out by a member of the public for his party’s perceived failure to adequately condemn Hamas in the wake of the atrocities it committed in Israel on October 7. During its surprise attack in southern Israel, Hamas militants murdered innocent civilians, in many cases using horrific methods, and abducted others, taking them back to the Gaza Strip, where many remain as hostages. The attack left more than 1400 Israelis dead, and prompted Israel to strike back at Hamas via heavy bombardment of Gaza. Hamas, which governs Gaza, has been designated a terrorist organisation by Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and a long list of other nations. The Greens have fulsomely backed pro-Palestinian protests across the country, and sparked a controversy in parliament a week ago when theyrefused to back a motion expressing support for Israeland the nation’s right to defend itself. The four Greens were the only MPs to vote against the motion. An amendment moved by Mr Bandt, accusing Israel of committing war crimes, drew the support of just three more MPs, all from the crossbench. Mr Bandt told parliament that while the Greens joined “everyone in this parliament in mourning the 1300 Israelis who have lost their lives”, he wanted to highlight “there are also between 2300 and 2600 Palestinians who have lost their lives, many of whom are children”. “And we mourn them as well,” he said. “This is now moving beyond self-defence into an invasion, and it is up to Australia as a peace-loving country to join the push to stop it.” On Monday night’s Q+A program on the ABC, audience member Paul Roberts raised the Greens’ position on the matter. “As an Australian Jew, I’ve been comforted in recent weeks by the concern and support I’ve been given by the Australian public and by the government and opposition,” Mr Roberts said. “Adam Bandt, are the Greens able to differentiate between terrorism and those fighting terrorism, and will the Greens dissociate themselves from the Australian protesters who call for a Palestine to replace Israel, rather than to live in peace with Israel?” Mr Bandt said the Greens have condemned the actions of Hamas. “We did that immediately. The taking of hostages is a war crime and the perpetrators need to be held to account and they need to be brought to justice. So we are crystal-clear on that,” Mr Bandt said. But he went on to say that the occupation of Palestinian territories had “pushed them into this open-air prison”. “We need a peace process so that both Palestinians and Israelis can live in the just peace and security that they are entitled to.” Q+A host Patricia Karvelas asked Mr Roberts if he was satisfied with Mr Bandt’s denouncement of anti-Semitism, including from some of the protesters. “No, because we are not going to be back here in five years, we will be back here in months if Hamas is not dismantled. Their sole existence is to kill all Israel worldwide,” Mr Roberts said. “When you hear people speak at rallies, where they say, ‘From the river to the sea, people should be free,’ the river is Jordan and Israel is the sea. “You are sending me a message as an Australian Jew that you are political bedfellows with organisations that seek the death of Israel.” Mr Bandt said that was not his position, nor the Greens’ position. Fellow panellist Larissa Baldwin-Roberts, a Widjabul Wia-bal woman from the Bundjalung Nations and CEO of progressive activist group GetUp, said she did not interpret the “From the river to the sea,” chant the same way. She wore a Palestinian scarf throughout the program to show support for Palestinians trapped in Gaza. “For First Nations people, there is an incredible solidarity that exists here. We are talking about securing a free future for Palestine,” she said. “We are talking about the freedom of continuing your language, your culture, not just to survive but to thrive as people.” She received applause for the answer, but groans later for her response on the slogan and why Jewish people find it offensive. “I don’t believe that it is hate speech,” she said. “I understand why people say this, and people see this as a call to freedom. I understand that you can see this in a different way as well.” Sydney teenager Saim Saeed, who lives in a predominantly Palestinian community, said he had felt betrayed by the government, believing “the response has been very one-sided and unfair towards them”, especially with the lighting of the Opera House in support of Israel. “Could the government have been more sympathetic towards the Palestinian people in a time of heightened tension?” he asked the panel. Albanese government minister Matt Thistlethwaite said the government had condemned Hamas, not the Palestinian people, over the attack. “I think most Australians were quite shocked and horrified at the brutality of the Hamas invasion, and we’ve certainly made the point in the parliament that our condemnation was directed to Hamas, the terrorist organisation, not to the Palestinian people who, in many respects, are innocent victims in this whole conflict.” But he deflected on the lighting of the Opera House, saying that was a matter for the NSW government and its guidelines for when the icon is used to show support. “I think in the circumstances it was probably appropriate given the expression of support that existed in the Australian community for Israel and the motion that was passed in parliament,” he said. Ms Baldwin-Roberts also weighed into the issue. “It is symbolism, but I would say people want substantive rights, not pretty lights,” she said. When Prealene Khera moved to a small town and was the first person of colour ever hired at the local paper, she was shocked by the reaction. The host of A Current Affair, Ally Langdon, struggled to hold it together while covering a tragic story on the program.

Top spy’s warning ‘not aimed at Dutton’,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/prime-minister-anthony-albanese-waiting-for-callback-from-israels-benjamin-netanyahu/news-story/83413ef06342cbc92f06e28df7c4dad4,"The chief of Australia’s domestic intelligence agency, Mike Burgess, has knocked back suggestions a media statement released by the organisation was directed at Opposition Leader Peter Dutton. The statement from Mike Burgess, director general of the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), was released on October 12, following the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas. It said it was critical that all parties consider the implications for social cohesion when making public statements. “As I have said previously, words matter. ASIO has seen direct connections between inflamed language and inflamed community tensions,” the statement from Mr Burgess read. In questioning from Liberal senator James Paterson, Mr Burgess denied the statement was aimed at Mr Dutton. “My statement was aimed at all Australians, including myself,” he said. Asked why journalists had formed that view, Mr Burgess said he did not know. Mr Dutton has previously maintained that he was told by Mr Burgess the statement was not directed at him. The Australian Border Force is preparing for new vaping regulations which will task the agency with seizing imported nicotine and non-nicotine vaping products. In May, the government announced it would ban the importation of non-prescription vaping products, in an attempt to crackdown on disposable vapes. Border Force confirmed discussions were currently under way to secure further resources to ramp up seizures and destroy the products. Currently, Border Force passes on vaping products to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for assessment, and vendors are penalised, however this has proven to be resource intensive and has failed to deter usage. In the last financial year, ABF intercepted some 800,000 vapes. Border Force officials have confirmed that 11 asylum seekers were transferred to Nauru in September, just months after the last remaining asylum seekers left the Pacific island nation. In questions from Greens senator Nick McKim at Senate estimates, Rear Admiral Justin Jones, who heads Operation Sovereign Borders, says Border Force had intercepted 11 people on September 7 who were later transferred to offshore processing. However, Rear Admiral Jones would not provide details about where their boat or boats were intercepted, if any women or children were aboard, and the arrivals country of origin, saying these matters were “operationally sensitive”. It is the first transfer to Nauru in nine years. Rear Admiral Jones said there had been a number of other interceptions this year but these had not resulted in any other arrivals to Nauru. Senator McKim accused the government of “outrageous secrecy” for maintaining the former government’s policy of not commenting on on-water matters and referred to Labor Senator Murray Watt as “Mr Morrison” who introduced the term when he was the responsible minister. He later withdrew the remark. In earlier questioning, it was revealed that offshore processing on Nauru is budgeted to cost taxpayers $400m this financial year, though there are presently just 13 asylum seekers on the island including the recent 11 arrivals. Australian bureaucrats are “still seeking to arrange” a call between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Appearing at a Senate estimates hearing on Monday afternoon, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade bureaucrats confirmed the department had initially reached out to their Israeli counterparts on October 8, the day after the first attacks on Israeli citizens by Hamas broke out, but were yet to confirm a call. The prime minister has received criticism from the opposition on the grounds that he hasn’t yet spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu, with opposition leader Peter Dutton calling for Mr Albanese to prioritise a trip to Tel Aviv. “He’s (Anthony Albanese) put a request in it seems to Mr Netanyahu, and it’s telling that Mr Netanyahu hasn’t taken that call,” Mr Dutton said in an interview on 2GB earlier this month. In questioning from Liberal senator Simon Birmingham, DFAT deputy secretary, Scott Dewar, said the prime ministers previously spoke on April 4 earlier this year.

16yo ‘brain dead’ after after station attack,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/iranian-teen-likely-brain-dead-after-alleged-assault-at-iranian-train-station/news-story/e15c826488119db5ee2dde067a8f873d,"An Iranian teen who was left in a coma after an alleged assault on the Tehran metro by female police officers is likely to be brain dead, Iranian media reported Sunday. The condition ofArmita Garawand, 16, was first reported on October 3 by a Kurdish-focused rights group Hengaw, which said she had been critically wounded during an incident on the metro. It came just over a year after the death of Mahsa Amini, also a Kurdish Iranian woman, for allegedly breaching Iran’s strict dress code for women in an incident that sparked mass protests across the Islamic republic. On Sunday, the state-affiliatedBornanews agency said it “seems certain” that Garawand was “brain dead”. It had reported on October 11 that her condition had deteriorated. According to state news agencyIRNA, Garawand fainted because of low blood pressure. But the Hengaw rights group said she had been hurt in a confrontation with female police officers on the metro for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress code for women. Garawand lives in Tehran but comes from Kermanshah, a city some 500 kilometres from the Iranian capital, in Kurdish-populated western Iran. The teenager, who was with friends and apparently not wearing a headscarf, is said to have been pushed into a metro carriage by female police agents. Garawand’s condition sparked interest in the West, with both Germany and the United States raising concerns about the case after a purported video of the incident circulated on social media. Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights had urged “an independent international investigation … to establish the details” of the incident, and accused Tehran of “a long history of distorting facts and concealing evidence of their crimes”. “The Islamic republic continues its harassment and repression of women under the guise of fighting mandatory hijab violations,” said the group’s director, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam. The head of the Tehran metro has denied there was any verbal or physical altercation between the teenager and passengers or staff. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
‘Hamas is not Palestine’: Barr on flag scandal,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/morning-shows/hamas-is-not-palestine-sunrise-host-natalie-barr-wade-into-sydney-councils-palestine-flag-controversy/news-story/80cad957aeb7d02fb76bba908e155228,"A Sydney councillor is fighting against a plan to fly the Palestinian flag above the town hall in a region with a large Jewish community. Randwick Council will take part in an International Day of Solidarity on 29 November, showing support for the Palestinian people in the midst ofthe brutal Israel-Hamas conflict. Councillor Daniel Rosenfeld will tonight bring a motion reversing the decision at an emergency general meeting. “Because of the horrific events of October 7 [when] Hamas killed 1400 Jewish people, took 200 hostage, more Jewish people died that day than any other day since the Holocaust,” Mr Rosenfeld told Sunrise host Natalie Barr in an interview this morning. “Israelis are under daily attack from rockets, both around the Gaza area and now in northern Israel. “There’s a large Jewish community here in the Randwick [local government area] and they will certainly feel very uncomfortable should the council fly the flag in a bit over a month’s time.” Barr questioned whether linking Palestinian civilians and Hamas terrorism was appropriate, saying there are “innocent people suffering today”. “That Hamas attack was horrific in every way and has been condemned right around the world, but as has also been said many times, Hamas is not Palestine. Doesn’t that flag represent them?” Mr Rosenfeld acknowledged that “Hamas are not Palestine” but said they “control the Gaza Strip” and are therefore an “integral part of that part of Palestine”. “I do acknowledge that and I feel for the innocent Palestinians that have been caught up. However, I do note that some of the casualties from the Palestinians are due to misfiring rockets from Hamas and Islamic State.” Randwick Council takes in several suburbs in Sydney’s east, including Clovelly, Coogee, Maroubra, Kingsford, Kensington and Randwick. A number of the more than 47,000 Jews who call New South Wales home live in the area. Barr said “there are innocent Palestinians who don’t support Hamas” and who feel it’s not their fault that Hamas controls the region. “Given the Hamas terrorist attacks, again 1400 Jews died, whole families were wiped out … there are a lot of people in this area with connections to people who were either injured or killed,” Mr Rosenfeld said. “Given the prominent Jewish community in this area, I really feel they’ll feel very uncomfortable for that flag to be raised in our LGA.” Barr wrapped up the interview by saying: “I’m sure it’s so difficult and I think a lot of people can see your side and the other one.” Mr Rosenfeld’s colleague Councillor Andrew Hay took to Facebook shortly after the interview aired to voice his support for the move. “Well done Councillor Daniel Rosenfeld! Getting our side of the story out to all Australia on Sunrise,” Mr Hay wrote. “Tonight we debate whether to cancel flying the flag of a terrorist state, after they have committed one of the worst atrocities in recent memory. “I & my fellow Liberals were always against raising the Palestinian Flag, and will vote against it tonight. Like if you agree.” A disgraced American weatherman has broken his silence after his videos from an adult webcam site were leaked to his boss.

Fans walk out on Chappelle over Israel line,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/dave-chappelle-fans-walk-out-after-he-blasts-israels-war-crimes-in-gaza-propalestinians-losing-job-offers-report/news-story/e45a2b82df788b4599abc3a12a6dcab7,"They weren’t laughing. Comedian Dave Chappelle criticised the United States for backing Israel’s “war crimes” against Palestinians during a live performance in Boston on Thursday, prompting some audience members to walk out, according to a report. The controversial comic made the remarks during a show at the TD Garden on Thursday,The Wall Street Journalreported. Chappelle condemnedHamas’ October 7 attackon Israel that left some 1,400 Israelis dead — but blasted what he claimed were Israel’s war crimes in Gaza, sparking some pushback from the crowd, people in attendance told the outlet. The brouhaha started when a member of the audience told Chappelle to “shut up” after he said he didn’t think people should lose their jobs for supporting Palestinians, according to theJournal. Chappelle, in response, criticised the Israeli government’s decision to cut off food, water and electricity to Gaza. He also accused Israel of killing innocent civilians and committing war crimes, according to the report. More than 4,300 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict as the Israel Defense Forces have relentlessly pommeled the enclave with more than 6,000 bombs. Those dead include women and children, according to Palestinian authorities. Other members of the audience cheered and shouted “Free Palestine!” while others shot back “What about Hamas?!”, witnesses told theJournal. Some members of the audience walked out after the raucous moment. Toward the end of the show, Chappelle reportedly said that two wrongs don’t make a right, in reference to the Hamas attacks and Israel’s subsequent military response. A spokesman for Chappelle told the outlet the comedian “denies being in Boston” that night — despite the show being listed among his dates by ticket outlets.

Thousands march in pro-Palestine rally,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/free-palestine-rally-attracts-thousands-in-melbourne-cbd/news-story/b683469ca54a1b93786fb150eef61e38,"Thousands of pro-Palestine protesters marched in the streets of Melbourne as the conflict between the nation and Israel deepens following an attack by terror group Hamas. Rally organisers Free Palestine Melbourne called for people to join them on the steps of the State Library as they marched to the Victorian parliament in Melbourne on Sunday. Protesters were calling for the conflict in Gaza to end and a stop to the blockade of food, water, fuel and medical supplies in the region. Those attending were seen carrying signs calling out the thousands of deaths in the last two weeks since the war began between Hamas and Israel. A Victoria Police spokeswoman said about 15,000 people attended the rally. “There were no major incidents of note,” she said. “However, as a matter of course, police will review any vision or CCTV from the day. “Our top priority was keeping the peace to ensure the event did not impact the safety of the broader community. “We will continue to retain communication with all communities which have a strong interest in events unfolding in the Middle East.” Greens leader Adam Bandt also spoke on Sunday to the thousands attending the rally. “It’s a war crime,” Mr Bandt said. “4000 Palestinians have been killed and the death toll that will continue to rise. “End the war in Gaza, end the invasion, peace for Palestine now.” Mr Bandt told the crowd the Greens had rallied against the invasion of Gaza. Protesters were also calling on the Australian Government to cut ties with Israel in support of those suffering in Palestine. Event organisers stated before the rally that there was no place for racism among protesters, following shocking scenes in Sydney earlier this month. “We remind everyone that the struggle for a free Palestine is an anti-racist struggle,” organisers stated on the Facebook event. “We condemn and oppose all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. “Ours is a struggle against the state of Israel, not against Jewish people, many of whom oppose Zionism, and who have a long history of being part of our movement for a free Palestine.” The Melbourne rally follows other protests across the country this week, held in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth on Saturday. A vigil was held in Hobart on Saturday, taking place outside the Hobart Town Hall. A protest in the national capital will take place on Wednesday at the National Press Club. It comes as more than 30 humanitarian organisations signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his senior ministers urging Australia to intervene diplomatically in the conflict. The Australian Council for International Development letter signed by organisations including Save the Children Australia, ActionAid and United Aid Abroad urges Australia to exert its influence to seek an urgent ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. “The Australian Government must use its voice and exert its influence to seek a ceasefire – an end to the rapidly escalating conflict – as a matter of urgency,” the letter stated. “We are deeply concerned at the ongoing violation of the human rights of citizens in Gaza and Israel, and breaches of International Humanitarian Law. “We ask your government to be unceasing in your efforts to achieve unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance, a humanitarian corridor and protection of civilians. “We call for a pause in the hostilities to allow for critical humanitarian work to save lives.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Hamas’ ‘underground terror route’ discovered,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-conflict-live-updates-cancer-patient-survives-after-throwing-himself-on-grenades/news-story/215f75c16c8347019cf9d670d3b105ad,"Israel says it plans to intensify its attacks on Gaza starting today. Speaking to reporters on Saturday in response to a question about a possible ground invasion into Gaza, the Israeli Rear ADM Daniel Hagari said: “We will deepen our attacks to minimise the dangers to our forces in the next stages of the war. We are going to increase the attacks from today.” On October 7, Hamas militants stormed into Israel from Gaza and killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burned to death on the first day of the raid, according to Israeli officials. Since then, more than 4,300 Palestinians, mainly civilians, have been killed in relentless Israeli bombardments, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. Read on for the latest news. ‘Underground terror route’ discovered, destroyed Israel has discovered what it says is an “underground terror route” inside a mosque in the city of Jenin, in the northern West Bank. The Times of Israelon Sundayshared an imagefrom the Israeli Defense Forces purportedly showing a doorway in the floor of a mosque that had been struck by military aircraft. It showed debris around a steel door in the floor of the building that the IDF said was being used by members of Hamas. In a joint statement with Shin Bet — Israel’s security agency — the IDF said Palestinian members of the terror organisation were sheltering there and were using the mosque as a base “to plan and carry out attacks”. The publication cited the recent detonation of an explosive near a West Bank security barrier as an example of how that shelter had been used. The official Wafa news agency said one person was killed in the Israeli strike. Thousands protest at pro-Palestinian rally in Melbourne Thousands of protesters have gathered for a pro-Palestinian rally at the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne. Crowds chanted “Free, free Palestine” and held up signs reading “stop the attack on Gaza” and “free Gaza”. “We do not support our government’s stance to support with Israel unconditionally”, one speaker told the crowds, according to theHerald Sun. Speaking near the event, Greens leader Adam Bandt called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an “end to the invasion”. “In many respects Gaza is a walled-in primary school with 40 per cent of the two million people there being aged under the age of 15,” he said according to theABC. Mr Bandt added “only the Greens voted against the invasion of Gaza, and the rest of the parliament voted for it”. ‘The head of the snake’: Israel’s vow to militant group War-poised Israel has vowed to attack Iran and cut off the “head of the snake” if Hezbollah joins forces with Hamas. Tehran’s Clerics will be “wiped off the face of the earth” should their Lebanon-based proxy terrorists invade Israel,The Sunreports. Nir Barkat, Israel’s Minister of Economy, who made the comments, believes the terror group is opening up a “northern front” in the war amid fresh fighting on the Lebanese border. Speaking toThe Mailon Sunday, he blasted: “We will not just retaliate to those fronts, but we will go to the head of the snake, which is Iran. “Israel has a very clear message to our enemies. Look what’s happening in Gaza – you are going to get the same treatment if you attack us.” Iran’s bile-mongering Ayatollah’s were warned they face sleepless nights and will “pay a heavy price” if Hezbollah militants flood into the Jewish State from the north. And Lebanon will face “similar to what Hamas is going to pay” if they allow their territory to be used as a launch pad, Mr Barkat added. ‘In the heart’: Militant group’s chilling admission The deputy leader of Hezbollah has issued a chilling warning if Israel starts a ground offensive in Gaza, saying the Iran-backed militant group based in Lebanon is already “in the heart of the battle”. Hezbollah said six of their fighters were killed on Saturday, as the Israeli military traded fire with Hezbollah on the Lebanon-Israel border. “We are trying to weaken the Israeli enemy and let them know that we are ready,” said Hezbollah’s deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem, according to the Associated Press. Hezbollah number two Naim Qassem also warned the movement stood ready to step up its involvement “Let’s be clear, as events unfold, if something comes up that calls for greater intervention by us, we will do so,” said Qassem. ‘We’re going to get them all out’: Biden’s promise to freed hostages The White House has posted a brief clip of President Biden’s phone call with two newly freed American hostages to celebrate their release from Gaza, theNew York Postreports. “Hey Judith,” Biden greeted Judith Raanan, 59, who was abducted with her 17-year-old daughter Natalie when Hamas stormed Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7. The women, of Evanston, Illinois, were visiting family for the Jewish holidays. “I’m so glad you’re home – or, not home, but glad you’re out,” Biden told the mother and daughter on the Friday call, according to the video shared on X. “Hey, Nat, how are you? God love ya,” Biden said. “I’m just delighted we were able to get you out, we’ve been working on it a long time.” The two women – who were released by Hamas on Friday after almost two weeks in captivity – thanked the commander-in-chief for his support of Israel. “We’re going to get ‘em all out – God willing,” Biden promised, referring to 10 other missing Americans who are suspected to have been taken by the terror group. Wild scenes in UK as thousands march for Palestine Nearly 100,000 people took to the streets in London on Saturday in an event organised by pro-Palestinian groups calling for “an end to the war on Gaza”. Marchers held signs reading “Freedom for Palestine”, “Stop Bombing Gaza” and “End Israeli Apartheid”. Many waved Palestinian flags and some chanted “5, 6, 7, 8, Israel is a terrorist state” and “Free Palestine”. “We came to show our support because we can’t stay silent, watch the news, and then do nothing,” Mariam Abdul-Ghani, an 18-year-old student whose family is from the Palestinian territories, told AFP. The march brought traffic at the Marble Arch landmark to a standstill, before it broke up peacefully close to Downing Street. There were also huge protests in other cities including Birmingham, Manchester, and Cardiff. Horror as Jewish leader found dead outside home A prominent synagogue president in Detroit in the US, was found dead outside of her home early on Saturday morning, police said. Samantha Woll was found with multiple stab wounds and police discovered a trail of blood leading to her home, where they believe the crime was committed. The 40-year-old, who led the Isaac Agree Downtown Detroit Synagogue since 2022 and previously worked with US congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, has been remembered as a “kind” person who was “driven by her sincere love of her community”. “Sam truly used her faith and activism to create a better place for everyone,” Michigan Attorney-General Dana Nessel said in one of many tributes which has poured in online. An investigation is currently taking place, and police are yet to release a motive for the crime or comment if it was considered a hate crime. Top Hamas official killed A senior Hamas commander and his wife have reportedly been killed in an Israeli air strike. Tall al-Hindi, a field commander in Hamas’ military wing, al-Qassam brigades, was killed in a strike on his home in the Gaza Strip, according to Hamas-affiliatedSafa News Agency. He is believed to have been killed while sheltering with his wife Fadwa, his daughter Israa, and her daughter Baraa. It comes days after fellow Hamas commander, Jehad Mheisen, was killed alongside members of his family in an Israeli air strike on his home —The Sunreports. A third Hamas top commander, Ayman Nofal, has also been killed. Cancer patient threw himself on Hamas grenades A cancer patient attending the Supernova festival in Israel when Hamas terrorists invaded and slaughtered 260 innocent civilians on October 7 survived a selfless act of heroism when he jumped on grenades in a bid to save others. Raz Peri, who is battling lymphoma, said he was at the festival to “feel alive again” but had to quickly turn to survival mode as the invasion unfolded, he toldCNNfrom his hospital bed. The 20-year-old watched in horror as “40 to 50” Hamas terrorists gunned down fleeing festival-goers during the early stages of the attack, theNew York Postreports. He scrambled with four others for shelter in a roadside bunker, but one of the women screamed when they saw the terrorists approaching the hide-out and speaking Arabic. He told the outlet that he “had nothing, just my hands” and was forced into a fistfight with one terrorist as they entered the doorway following the woman’s scream. Other Hamas invaders began firing at Peri but instead struck a hiding festival-goer in the leg. The fight ended outside the shelter with Hamas terrorists accidentally shooting dead one of their own, the outlet reported. They quickly retreated back into the shelter, and then the remaining terrorists surrounded the structure and peered in with “crazy eyes,” before throwing multiple grenades inside. Peri then selflessly threw his body onto the grenades to absorb the blast and save the others. The explosion tore through his leg and left him partially unconscious,The Times of Londonreported. He has been recovering for the past 13 days at the Kaplan Medical Centre in Rehovot. Israel declares ‘next phase of war’ Israel is to immediately step up its strikes in Gaza to increase pressure on Hamas, a military spokesman told a press conference on Saturday. Israel has also massed tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks along the Gaza border for a widely anticipated ground invasion. “We have to enter the next phase of the war in the best conditions, not according to what anyone tells us. From today, we are increasing the strikes and minimising the danger,” military spokesman Admiral Daniel Hagari told a press conference. His comments came hours after the first international aid to reach Gaza since October 7 crossed the border from Egypt into the besieged Palestinian territory Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Daring night-time raids into Gaza Strip,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-live-coverage-as-ground-invasion-continues-to-loom/news-story/614e3c4af676fe177ea346f3d49bdb1d,"WARNING: Distressing content Welcome to our live coverage of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. As Sunday dawned in the Middle East, the Israeli military followed through on a promise to intensify its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, its stated aim being to minimise the threat to its soldiers when they begin an anticipated ground invasion. Israel has repeatedly warned residents of northern Gaza, of whom there are more than a million, to move south for their safety. According to the United Nations, more than half of the Gazan population is now internally displaced. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are believed to still be in and around Gaza City in the north, as they’re either unwilling or unable to leave. The IDF has now updated the hostage figure to 222. More than 4,650 have been killed in Gaza, around 40 percent of them children, the Palestinian health ministry reported on Monday. Thousands of buildings have been destroyed and more than one million people displaced. Gaza’s Hamas-controlled government media office said that “more than 60 were martyred in the raids” during the night - including 17 in a single strike that hit a house in northern Gaza - and at least 10 others were killed in new strikes on Monday morning. Read on for the latest news. ‘They betrayed us’: Civilian shelter bombedReuters has interviewedan 18-year-old Palestinian who says 13 of her family members were killed in an air strike, despite heeding Israeli warnings to move south for their safety.Dima Al-Lamdani told the news service her immediate family and that of her uncle travelled south from a refugee camp in Gaza City in two cars, ending up at a temporary shelter in Khan Younis, a city in southwestern Gaza, near the border with Egypt.In the early hours of the morning, the shelter was bombed.“At 4.30am I was awake and sitting with my aunt drinking coffee. Suddenly I woke up in the middle of ruins. Everyone around me was screaming, so I screamed,” Ms Al-Lamdani said.After searching for her family members in the morgue, she found that only her brother and two of her young cousins had survived the blast.“This is a nightmare. It will never be wiped from my memory,” she said.“I had a sister, 16. They wrote my name on the white sheet they wrapped her body in. They thought it was me.”Ms Al-Lamdani said the Israelis had “betrayed” her family.“They told us to evacuate your place and go to Khan Younis, because it is safe,” she said.“They betrayed us and bombed us.”In a statement to Reuters, the IDF said: “The IDF has been encouraging residents of the northern Gaza Strip to move southward and not to stay in the vicinity of Hamas terror targets within Gaza City.“But, ultimately, Hamas has entrenched itself among the civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip. So wherever a Hamas target arises, the IDF will strike at it in order to thwart the terrorist capabilities of the group, while taking feasible precautions to mitigate the harm to uninvolved civilians.” Daring night-time raids into Gaza While no official ground invasion has been initiated yet, the IDF today confirmed small strike teams had been operating within the Gaza Strip, launching daring but limited night-time raids to take out Hamas terrorists. Military spokesman Daniel Hagari said small “armoured and infantry forces” had been deployed overnight “to kill terrorist cells that are preparing for next phases of war”.“During the night there were raids by tank and infantry forces. These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for our next stage in the war,” he said.“These are raids that go deep.”The operation was also focused on gathering more information on the 222 hostages still held by Hamas, most of whom are Israeli citizens. Hospitals operating without painkillers Aid agencies across the globe have continued calls to cease violence in Gaza, with hospitals now forced to operate without basic painkillers and morphine as casualties stack up. Aid trucks from various nations have arrived, but there are still fears over civilians getting adequate supplies as Gaza runs out of basic items. “What is extremely important are the trauma kits, the surgery kits,” the Head of Mission for Medicins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) Leo Cans said. Doctors working in the warzone are “doing surgical operations without the correct dose of narcotics, without the correct dose of morphine”, according to Cans. “In terms of pain management, it‘s not happening. We currently have people being operated on without having morphine. It just happened to two kids.We have a lot of kids that are unfortunately among the wounded, and I was discussing with one of our surgeons, who received a 10-year-old yesterday, burnt on 60 per cent of the body surface, and he didn‘t end up having painkillers. “There is no justification at all to block these essential medicines to reach the population.” The lack of fuel to power vehicles and generators has also been noted by aid agencies working in the region. “Fuel is essential for the water plants in order to desalinate to water…If you don’t have fuel, you don‘t have quality water,” Cans said. “Even war has rules, and you cannot bomb civilians. We have too many children, too many women arriving at the hospital. It is not acceptable.” IDF confirms raids carried out in Gaza While no official ground invasion has been initiated yet, the IDF today confirmed small strike teams had been operating within Gaza, launching daring but limited night-time raids to take out Hamas terrorists. Military spokesman Daniel Hagari said small “armoured and infantry forces” had been deployed overnight “to kill terrorist cells that are preparing for next phases of war”. The operation was also focused on gathering more information on the 222 hostages still held by Hamas, most of whom are Israeli citizens. IDF hits 320 targets in one day Israeli forces reported they had attacked 320 targets across the Gaza Strip over the last 24 hours. Posting on X, formerly Twitter, the IDF said it had targeted Hamas infrastructure, including tunnels and operational headquarters. The IDF said it had struck critical positions that could “endanger” its forces in a ground invasion. The Palestinian interior ministry said 17 people were killed and dozens injured by two separate Israeli strikes in northern Gaza. One missile hit a house in Jabalia, while another hit an apartment in the Al-Faluga neighbourhood early in the day. A further 10 were killed in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Israel official declares ‘no ceasefire’ A senior Israeli official has announced there will be “no ceasefire” in Gaza even as allied nations rally to free hundreds of hostages stuck in the region under siege. Israel has openly placed the eradication of Hamas at the top of its priority list as multiple calls from humanitarian agencies attempt to stop the violence. The official, speaking with CNN said they were “not aware” of US calls for a delay to Israel’s expected Gaza ground operation, which has been speculated for over a week. “Humanitarian efforts cannot be allowed to impact the mission to dismantle Hamas,” the official said. Reports of explosions near several Gaza hospitals There have been reports of explosions near several hospitals in Gaza as the city wakes from another night of conflict with Israel. The hospitals include Al-Shifa, the largest medical complex in Gaza, as well as Al-Quds and the Indonesian Hospital, according to the Reuters news agency citing Palestinian media. Hamas published a video where it claimed an Israeli airstrike stuck near Al-Quds. It also published pictures of a destroyed building on its Telegram channel, claiming it was behind the Kuwaiti Hospital. These claims are yet to be independently verified. Terrorists had ‘cyanide’ instructions Hamas terrorists killed in the horrific October 7 attack on southern Israelwere discoveredcarrying instructions on how to deploy cyanide-based chemical bombs, Israeli officials revealed. The directions included detailed diagrams for a “cyanide dispersion device” and were stored in USBs found on the bodies of Hamas operatives who massacred kibbutz Be’eri, according to Israeli intelligence reviewed by Axios. “This finding points to an intention by Hamas to use chemical weapons as part of its terror attack against civilians,” a cable sent by Israel to its embassies read. The cable advised the embassies to inform its diplomats that Hamas had been instructed “to conduct attacks in a similar way that ISIS tried to do”. Israeli President Isaac Herzog confirmed the existence of the instructions during an interview with Sky News on Sunday, disclosing they originated from an al-Qaeda design for chemical weapons dating back to 2003. “It’s al-Qaeda material. Official al-Qaeda material. We are dealing with ISIS, al-Qaeda and Hamas,” President Herzog said. “This is how shocking the situation is where we’re looking at the instructions that are given on how to operate and how to create a kind of non-professional chemical weapon with cyanide.” Israeli officials have repeatedly compared Hamas to groups like ISIS — a terror group known for using horrifying violence while trying to force extremist Islamic law across the world — since its attack on the Jewish homeland two weeks ago. “The atrocities carried out by Hamas have not been seen since the atrocities of ISIS,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address shortly after the attack. “Children bound and executed with the rest of their families, young girls and boys shot in the back, executed, and other atrocities that I will not describe here.” Hamas even brought ISIS flags to some of the kibbutzs attacked during the ambush, according to images released by Israeli Defense Force soldiers. Israel has disclosed other pieces of intelligence reportedly found on the bodies of Hamas agents, including battle plans to “kill as many people as possible” and take hostages as they raided and burned civilian villages. Some plans reportedly included explicit directions to target schools for kidnapping children en masse and pointed out locations where large groups of people were likely to be found like supermarkets and dining halls. — NY Post Western leaders reiterate Israel support US President Joe Biden discussed the Israel-Hamas waron Sundaywith leaders of major Western powers, the White House said, as Israel intensified its attacks on Gaza. Mr Biden spoke with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Italy, the White House said. “The leaders reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians,” a White House readout of the discussions said. It said the leaders discussed their own citizens trapped in the Israel-Hamas war, “in particular those wishing to leave Gaza”. Fighting raged unchecked and scores more were killed in air strikes by Israel in Gaza as the humanitarian situation in the enclave worsened. Another convoy of 17 aid trucks arrived in Gaza as the Hamas-run territory faced “catastrophic” shortages. The readout said the Western leaders voiced commitment to co-ordinate “to ensure sustained and safe access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance required to meet humanitarian needs”. They also pledged close diplomatic co-ordination “to prevent the conflict from spreading, preserve stability in the Middle East, and work toward a political solution and durable peace”. In addition to Mr Biden, those on the call included Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the White House said. ‘We must deport on a large scale’ Germany must “finally deport on a large scale those who have no right to stay” in the country, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has declared in the wake of pro-Palestinian protests and incidents of anti-Semitism. Mr Scholz outlined the tougher approach to migrants inan interviewwithDer Spiegelon Friday, following a trip to Israel where he met with family members of German citizens taken hostage by Hamas during the October 7 attacks. He slammed recent violent anti-Semitic protests, particularly in Berlin, and said Germany stood by its Jewish citizens against those who “unashamedly celebrate the death of those killed in the Hamas terror attack”. The interviewer asked, “Among those in Germany who harbour hatred for Israel are many people with Arab roots. Did German policymakers ignore for too long the deep hatred entrenched in some groups?” Mr Scholz denied the issue had been “ignored”, but said going forward “we will now be differentiating even more precisely” who was coming to the country and who was allowed to stay. He outlined a “package of measures” to reduce the number of people coming to Germany, including working with the European Union to ensure migrants are “fairly distributed”, tighter border controls and winding back cash payments. “And I haven’t even mentioned one important one yet — we must finally deport on a large scale those who have no right to stay in Germany,” Mr Scholz said, referring to asylum seekers found not to be genuine. “Those who are not likely to be granted permission to stay in Germany because they cannot claim a need for protection must go back,” he said. “To make that possible, our public authorities must be reachable around the clock so that someone can actually be deported when the federal police take them into custody … Court proceedings must also speed up. In some states, initial rulings in deportation cases come after four months, while in others, it takes 39 months. That is unacceptable. We have to deport people more often and faster.” Germany took in more than1.1 million migrantsin the wake of the 2015 crisis. Growing public discontent has led to a surge in popularity of the far-right AfD party, which recently made unprecedented election gains in the west German states of Hesse and Bavaria, putting pressure on the three-party governing coalition led by Mr Scholz’s Social Democrats. His government has already signalled it is looking to tighten immigration policy, which is considered by 44 per cent of German voters to the country’s “biggest political problem”, “way ahead of environmental and climate issues (18 per cent) and the cost of living (13 per cent)”, Aston University’s Ed Turner and University of Birmingham’s Julian Hoerner wrote forThe Conversationlast week. Diplomat urged Hamas to use paragliders A formerEuropean Unionenvoy to Gaza is being slammed for allegedly empowering Hamas to use paragliders, the very devices employed by the Palestinian terrorists to invade Israel and kill more than 1400. Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff, a German diplomat, crowed on video in July that he was conducting “the first Gaza paragliding flight in history” as he soared over Gaza’s coast while shouting, “Free Palestine!” The giddy then-EU envoy told Palestinians in the footage that once they’re free, “You can do exactly the same thing.” But rather than seeing Palestinians enjoy recreational paragliding as he advocated, such gliders were instead used by Hamas to kill Israelis on October 7. Israel has since declared war on Hamas and launched devastating airstrikes on Gaza, prompting Mr von Burgsdorff to condemn the Jewish state, claiming it “doesn’t matter what Hamas did”,Israel Hayomreported. I wonder what the UN Envoy (Sven Kuhn Von Burgsdorf) think now. I think he is a collaborator of Nazi murdererspic.twitter.com/WD7kZTp2Fd “It cannot be that Israel has carte blanche because terrible acts, cruel and shocking acts happened to 1000 or even 1200 Israelis,” Mr von Burgsdorff said during a recent radio interview. “This is not the excuse you can use to flatten Gaza.” The former diplomat found himself in the middle of the debate raging around the Israel-Hamas war after the video resurfaced of him taking to the skies over Gaza in July, claiming Palestinians could enjoy things such as paragliding and kayaking if Israel ended its blockade. Israel’s foreign ministry condemned the spectacle at the time as a form of “provocative” propaganda that only serves to empower Hamas. “The European diplomat forgot a long time ago that he represents the European Union and its member states,” the ministry said in a statement. “[He] continues to represent the Palestinian narrative and to be a propaganda tool in the hands of the terrorist organisations that control Gaza.” A rep for the EU delegation to the Palestinians told Reuters that the paraglider used in the stunt belonged to von Burgsdorff. Von Burgsdorff left his post in Gaza in August but has continued to voice his opposition to Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territory, most recently involving its airstrikes. With more than 4700 Palestinians killed since October 7, the diplomat said in the radio interview that nothing justified “the use of such deadly force without distinction and proportionality as far as the Palestinian population in Gaza is concerned. “It cannot be that Israel is threatening to bomb corridors and shipments carrying humanitarian equipment. It cannot be. It is another war crime if it happens,” he added. He did not condemn Hamas’ attack in Israel that targeted hundreds of innocent civilians, many of them women and children, and also involved the kidnapping more than 200 people, including at least a dozen Americans. Mr von Burgsdorff could not be immediately reached for comment. — NY Post Israel says ‘no ceasefire’ for hostage talks A senior Israeli official has told CNN there will be“no ceasefire”in Gaza amid efforts by US and Qatar to free the more than 200 hostages held by Hamas. On Friday, Hamas released twoAmerican hostages, Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie Raanan, for “humanitarian reasons”. Asked on Saturday if the US was encouraging Israel to delay the invasion, US President Joe Biden said, “I’m talking to the Israelis.” CNN later reported the US was pressing Israel to delay the invasion to allow for the release of more hostages and the transfer of aid into Gaza. The Israeli official told CNN they were “not aware” of US calls for a delay and said both countries wanted all hostages released “as quickly as possible”. “Humanitarian efforts cannot be allowed to impact the mission to dismantle Hamas,” the official said. Elite unit to hunt down terrorists Anelite unitof Israeli agents has been formed to hunt down every Hamas terrorist involved in the heinous October 7 sneak attack on the Jewish state, according to reports. The specially selected members of Shin Bet, Israel’s version of the FBI, will function independently from other units targeting high-ranking terrorists, theJerusalem Postsaid. The new unit will specifically target members of the special Hamas commando group called Nukhba, which is believed to have pulled off the attack that slaughtered hundreds of innocent Israelis along the country’s border with the Gaza Strip. The unit is being named after the World War I-era Jewish underground organisation “Nili”, an acronym in Hebrew for “the Eternal One of Israel will not lie”, said theTimes of Israel. Shin Bet and the Israeli Defense Forces were chided in the aftermath of the massacre for being caught off guard. Shin Bet’s new unit will use intelligence as well as agents in the field to hunt down the estimated 2500 terrorists involved in the attack. The Israel Defense Forces has already announced the deaths of several Nukhba operatives, including Billal al-Qedra, the head of the terror group’s Khan Younis battalion, and commander Ali Qadhi. Last week, the Israeli military reported killing 10 Nukhba militants during operations in the Gaza Strip. — NY Post Horror evidence from massacre Graphic images released by Israeli authorities reportedly show the scale and brutality of the October 7 massacre by Hamas, with evidence of civilians tied up and burned alive and multiple victims, including babies, with their heads cut off. International media were invited to review forensic evidence of the terror attacks at Israel’s National Center of Forensic Medicine, also known as Abu Kabir, in Tel Aviv last week. Israeli officials allowed the unprecedented access to the facility, where experts have been trying to identify the mutilated and charred remains of hundreds of people slain in the attacks, in the face of denials by Hamas and scepticism online about some of the most horrific allegations, such as babies being beheaded. One image shown to journalists was of a charred mass of flesh, alongside a CT scan which revealed two spinal columns — belonging to an adult and a child. Adults and children were bound and burned alive, their bodies charred beyond recognition.pic.twitter.com/a1eEUVw8gl They had been bound together by metal wires before being set alight. “On the scanner, we clearly see two spinal columns,” said the centre’s director Hen Kugel. “That of a man or a woman, and that of a child. The posture of the two bodies shows that the adult tried to protect the child. They were tied up then burned alive.” Dr Kugel, who was reduced to tears, said officials “decided to show this horror because there are people who accuse us of lying, of telling stories and of actually showing dog bones”. “I’ve been doing this job for 31 years,” Dr Kugel said. “I’ve never seen such barbarity, such cruelty, such relentlessness. It’s just atrocious.” Nurit Boublil, head of the genetic identification unit, said more than 500 bodies had been identified out of the hundreds brought to the centre since October 7. “Everything is made more difficult by the fact that often those who were tortured were tied together,” Dr Boublil said. “It is therefore possible that in a single bag there are two bodies or even three.” According to members of an international team of forensic pathologists examining the bodies of the victims, Hamas terrorists committed unfathomable atrocities on 10/7.https://t.co/gCnYiS43Kzpic.twitter.com/toI9P2M293 Dr Kugel said the age of the victims ranged from three months to 90 years old, and that many were without heads. He told The Media Line they had been decapitated, although admitted that given the state of the bodies it was difficult to tell whether it occurred before or after death and “whether cut off by knife or blown off by RPG”. “We don’t know how many babies died, or how many elderly people,” Dr Kugel said. “There are also a lot of headless bodies. It will take a little more time to identify everyone.” Similar work has been ongoing at four other sites in Israel. One of them is the Shura military base near the central town of Ramla, where refrigerated containers are lined up, each holding up to 50 bodies. One of the team leaders, Rabbi Israel Weiss, showed the site to a group of journalists. Rabbi Weiss and other staff said there were signs that many of the victims had been tortured or raped. “Never in my life have I seen the horrors that lie behind us today,” he said. “I have seen babies, women and men beheaded. I have seen a pregnant woman with her belly torn open and the baby cut out. A lot of the women who were brought here were raped.” Israel launches new wave of strikes The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it is carrying out a wave of air strikes on Hamas targets inside Gaza. “The IDF continues to attack dozens of terrorist targets throughout the Gaza Strip at this time,” the IDF wrote on X, sharing footage of air strikes on Sunday. ×¦×”""×œ ×ž×ž×©×™×š ×œ×ª×§×•×£ ×‘×©×¢×” ×–×• ×¢×©×¨×•×ª ×ž×˜×¨×•×ª ×˜×¨×•×¨ ×‘×¨×—×‘×™ ×¨×¦×•×¢×ª ×¢×–×”pic.twitter.com/lDTsFEKXSI The IDF earlier published aerial images showing what it said were Hamas rocket launchers placed near civilian infrastructure including mosques, schools and UN buildings. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button. “Since the beginning of the war, the Hamas terrorist organisation has been exploiting civilians and civilian sites such as kindergartens, schools, and mosques for the purpose of firing rockets at Israel,” IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari wrote. “Hamas deliberately fires its rockets at Israeli civilians.” The military has pounded Gaza with relentless strikes in response to Hamas’ October 7 attack, killing more than 4650 Palestinians, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and reduced swathes of the densely populated territory to ruins. The IDF has long accused Hamas of using the people of Gaza as human shields by placing its weapons in or near civilian buildings. Aerial footage of the strike published by the IDF confirms that a building near the church was targeted, but the church itself was not struck.Unlike Hamas terror rockets, the IDF actually aims with precision.pic.twitter.com/vU2vAjI4B1 On Thursday, an Israelistrike destroyeda building in the compound of the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church in Gaza City, where several displaced people were reportedly sheltering. The IDF later released footage of the strike, saying its fighter jets had hit a command-and-control centre involved in launching rockets and mortars towards Israel near the church. “As a result of the IDF strike, a wall of a church in the area was damaged,” it said. “We are aware of reports on casualties. The incident is under review.” The health ministry in Gaza claimed 16 people were killed. Former US politician Justin Amash wrote on X that several of his relatives were among the dead. US warns against ‘escalation’ The United States warned Iran or its allies against any escalation in the wake of Israel’s war with Hamas, two top US officials said on Sunday, hours after the Pentagon moved to step up military readiness in the region. With tensions mounting, Washington also announced it had ordered non-emergency staff to leave its embassy in Iraq. “We are concerned at the possibility of Iranian proxies escalating their attacks against our own personnel, our own people,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CBS News. “We expect there is a likelihood of escalation. No one should take advantage of this moment to escalate to further attacks on Israel or, for that matter, attacks on us on our personnel.” Mr Blinken said the United States, which has sent two carrier groups to the eastern Mediterranean, was “taking every measure to make sure that we can defend them … and if necessary, respond decisively”. His words doubled down on an earlier message from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who warned of a “prospect of significant escalation of attacks on our troops” in the region. Their comments came amid growing fears that pro-Iranian Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon, or other groups supported by Tehran, might take advantage of the tense situation over Gaza to enlarge the conflict and further stretch Israel’s military. But Mr Austin, speaking to ABC News, issued a stern warning. “If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation that we see, our advice is — don’t,” he said. “We maintain the right to defend ourselves and we won’t hesitate to take the appropriate action.” IDF soldier killed as clashes begin An Israeli soldier has been killed and three others wounded after an ambush by Hamas fighters, in what appears to be one of the first skirmishes inside the Gaza Strip since the war broke out. The Palestinian terrorist group’s Al-Qassam Brigades said on Sunday its fighters had destroyed two Israeli military bulldozers and a tank in an ambush, forcing the troops to retreat without their vehicles. “The soldiers of the Zionist force that fell into the Khan Younis ambush left their vehicles and fled east of the fence on foot,” the Al-Qassam Brigades said on social media, CNN reported. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later confirmed a soldier had been killed and three hurt after they were attacked carrying out an operation on the western side of the Gaza border earlier on Sunday, near the southern Israeli community of Kissufim. The IDF said Hamas fighters launched an antitank guided missile at an Israeli tank and engineering vehicle, being used as part of the search for bodies of missing Israelis and to clear the area for the upcoming ground offensive, theTimes of Israelreported. “Shots were fired at IDF soldiers operating west of the Gaza Strip security fence, in the area of Kissufim,” the IDF said. “An IDF tank struck the terrorist cell who fired at the soldiers.” The IDF has launched several raids inside Gaza since the Hamas terror attack on October 7, but clashes had not been reported in previous announcements. Israel strikes Syrian airports Israeli strikes on Sunday put out of service war-torn Syria’s two main airports, state media reported citing a military source, with the transport ministry saying flights were re-routed to Latakia. While Israeli strikes have repeatedly caused the grounding of flights at the government-controlled airports in the capital Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo, it is the second time simultaneous strikes have hit the facilities since this month’s conflict between Israel and Hamas began. “At around 5.25am (1.25pm AEDT), the Israeli enemy carried out … an air attack … targeting Damascus and Aleppo international airports, leading to the death of a civilian worker at Damascus airport and wounding another,” the military source said in the statement carried by state news agency SANA. The wounded worker later died, state television reported, citing a transport ministry source. The military source said the “simultaneous” strikes came “from the direction of the Mediterranean west of Latakia and from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan”, according to the statement. “Material damage to the airports’ runways put them out of service,” the statement added. The transport ministry said flights were diverted to Latakia airport. Syria’s foreign ministry lambasted the Israel strikes on the airports as well as its assault on Gaza, and criticised the country’s backers in a statement later on Sunday. Syria “warns of the consequences of continuing these attacks and practises … that could plunge the region into wider spiralling violence that will be difficult to contain,” the statement said. On October 12, simultaneous strikes knocked both Damascus and Aleppo airports out of service, Syria said at the time. Last weekend, Israeli strikes targeted Aleppo airport, wounding five people, a war monitor reported, and also putting it out of service, according to the authorities. During more than a decade of war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of air strikes on its northern neighbour, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters, as well as Syrian army positions. Israel rarely comments on individual strikes it carries out on Syria, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow its arch foe Iran, which supports President Bashar al-Assad’s government, to expand its presence there. ‘Mistake of its life’: Netanyahu’s blunt warning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Hezbollah that entering the war to help Hamas would be the “mistake of its life”. Hezbollah, a political party and militant group based in Lebanon, is considered a terrorist organisation by Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and a lengthy list of other nations, including members of the Arab League. The European Union only classifies its military wing as such. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading sporadic fire since the war against Hamas started. Mr Netanyahu’s remarks on Sunday, delivered during a visit to a commando brigade in northern Israel, were aimed at preventing an escalation. “I cannot tell you right now if Hezbollah will decide to enter the war fully,” he said, adding that doing so would prompt counterstrikes of “unimaginable” magnitude from Israel and lead to “devastation” in Lebanon. Mr Netanyahu suggested such a conflict would make Hezbollah “miss” their previous war against Israel in 2006, in which more than a thousand Lebanese citizens were killed and about a million were displaced. “If Hezbollah decides to enter the war, it will long for the second Lebanon war. It will be making the mistake of its life,” he said, according toThe Times of Israel. “We will strike it with strength that it cannot even imagine. “It’s a very difficult thing, but we are in the fight of our life, a fight for our home. That’s not an exaggeration, it’s not an overstatement. That’s this war. It is kill or be killed, and they need to be killed.” Death toll surges as second aid convoy arrives According to Gaza’s health ministry, the death toll among Palestinians has risen to 4,651, 40 per cent of whom are children. That’s in addition to 14,245 people who have been wounded, among whom 70 per cent are claimed to be children or women. Over the past 24 hours, it is claimed, Israeli strikes killed 266 Palestinians, 117 of whom were children. Those figures are attributed to a spokesperson for the health ministry, Ashraf Al-Qudra. They have not been independently verified. Meanwhile a second convoy of aid trucks has arrived at the Rafah crossing, which is the only entry point into Gaza from Egypt and the only route through which aid can reach the Strip. There appear to be 17 trucks, which follow a convoy of 20 yesterday. Israel has agreed to let aid come through the Rafah crossing but says it will not allow the same via its own border points with Gaza until all hostages are released. ‘Shut up’: Protesters slapped down Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Kingdom, has gone on television to say pro-Palestinian protesters attending rallies in the nation to intimidate or express hatred for Jewish people should “shut up”. He stressed that most protesters were not acting in such a way. Dr Zomlot’s remarks came the morning after roughly 100,000 pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in the British capital, London. There have also been demonstrations in Australia, one of which turned ugly when protesters chanted “gas the Jews” in front of the Sydney Opera House. “This is abhorrent, unacceptable. Those people hijack our cause for their own twisted logic,” the ambassador said of the crowd’s unsavoury elements. “The Jewish people have nothing to do with it. This is not a religious conflict. Many of those who demonstrated for Palestine yesterday were Jews. Many of those strong voices are the Jewish people defending us. Those who have hate in their hearts for Jews would have hate in their hearts for Muslims and Christians. We have nothing to do with them and they should shut up.” Dr Zomlot represents the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), which is officially recognised as the international spokesman for the Palestinian people. It runs the Palestine National Authority, which governs the West Bank, and is more moderate than Hamas. During his Sky News interview, Dr Zomlot was asked whether the atrocities committed by Hamas during its attack on Israel had made the PLO’s ultimate goal of a two-state solution “less likely”. The ambassador responded by accusing “successive Israeli governments”, over a period spanning decades, of “undermining” the two-state solution. “Now creating a Palestinian state is becoming more and more an impossibility,” he said. “Hamas, and all other groups, are part of that failure to actually head in the direction we wanted to be heading. “I think the Israeli unwillingness to really go genuinely on that path has created this situation. “What Israel is doing right now has nothing to do with Hamas. It’s revenge, and supremacists who want to use the moment to actually finish off (the two-state solution).” Pressed repeatedly to address Hamas’s actions specifically, he did not. Dispute over chilling message to civilians Israel has hit back at claims about the wording of leaflets it dropped into Gaza on Saturday, as part of its continuing warnings that civilians should evacuate south. The message, bearing the IDF’s logo and written in Arabic, was widely reported as saying: “Urgent warning to residents of Gaza. Your presence north of Wadi Gaza puts your life in danger. Whoever chooses not to leave north Gaza to the south of Wadi Gaza might be identified as an accomplice in a terrorist organisation.” This was taken, by many, to imply that Israel will consider any civilians who remain in northern Gaza “accomplices” of Hamas. The IDF insists that translation is “imprecise”. “The translation from Arabic that has now spread across platforms is imprecise,” the IDF said in a statement. “To clarify, the IDF has no intention of considering those who have yet to evacuate a member of a terrorist group. “The IDF states, once again, for the safety of Gazan civilians, that they should evacuate to the south of Wadi Gaza. “All those who remain are endangering themselves due to the Hamas’s terrorist activities within civilian areas.” Despite its warnings to move south, Israel has continued to launch air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip has well as in the north. Israel warns it will cut off ‘snake’s head’ A prominent minister in the Israeli government has warned it will attack Iran and cut off “the head of the snake” if Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, joins forces with Hamas. Hezbollah, a political party and militant group based in Lebanon, is considered a terrorist organisation by Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and a lengthy list of other nations, including members of the Arab League. The European Union only classifies its military wing as such. Speaking to Britain’sDaily Mail, Israel’s Minister of the Economy, Nir Barkat, expressed his worry that Hezbollah would open up a “northern front” in the war. He added that Iran’s clerics would be “wiped off the face of the earth” if that happened. “We will not just retaliate to those fronts, but we will go to the head of the snake, which is Iran,” said Mr Barkat. “Israel has a very clear message to our enemies. Look what’s happening in Gaza. You are going to get the same treatment if you attack us.” He said Lebanon would face a fate “similar to what Hamas is going to pay” if it allowed its territory to be used as a launch pad. – with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

‘Horrible price’: Aussie leader’s plea to Israel,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/ed-husic-says-palestinians-are-paying-a-horrible-price-for-hamas-terrorism/news-story/4a68994a76ac90bdf8bbe1866dc40d71,"A senior Labor minister has doubled down on his condemnation of Israel as it retaliates following an attack by Hamas on civilians at a festival, amid split loyalties over who’s to blame for the deteriorating war in the Middle East. Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic said he supported Israel’s right to defend itself against militant groups but affirmed “there’s got to be a better way to target Hamas”, noting Palestinian civilians have been caught up in the attacks. His comments come as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese prepares to leave for Washington DC later on Sunday to meet with US President Joe Biden to discuss the unfolding Israel-Hamas crisis. Industry Minister Ed Husic told Sky News “innocent civilians are paying a horrible price for Hamas’ barbarism” condemning the deaths of thousands of children who have been killed in the conflict. This came after the cabinet minister broke with government ranks on Thursday to criticise Israel for punishing the people of Gaza for the actions of Hamas. “Cutting power, fuel, water and medicine to an entire population has a significant consequence,” Mr Husic said on Sunday. “Rules of international law require that civilians be protected, and there has to be an effort from Israel.” Mr Husic said Labor members had expressed wide concerns about the welfare of both Israelis and innocent Palestinian civilians affected by the conflict. He pressed that Australia should continue to take measures in an attempt to de-escalate the conflict. “It‘s very hard for people to watch to see what’s happening and they’ll react first and foremost as people recognise the suffering of others,” he said. Shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie said a looming ground invasion by the Israeli army on Gaza will be an “infinitely complex challenge” for soldiers involved. “We can expect a lot of casualties,” Mr Hastie said on Sunday. Israel’s defence force flagged it will intensify air strikes on Gaza on Saturday to “minimise risk of troops in the next stages of war.” This came as the death toll in Gaza rose to 4,385, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Senior Liberal Simon Birmingham said Israel had every right to defend itself against militant groups, including Hamas who have controlled parts of Gaza since 2007. “Israel is trying to work through what is an incredibly complex problem in terms of how they disable Hamas and remove them from power,” he told ABC’s Insiders. “If we are to ultimately see a situation where Israelis and Palestinians are in a position to be able to talk, to negotiate and finally live peacefully side by side with one another, then there needs to be a structure other than Hamas in place ... you can‘t negotiate with terrorists in this type of instance.” On concerns over Iran’s ongoing support of Hamas, Senator Birmingham said Australia should take stronger action including listing the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation. “Iran has been responsible of enabling Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRGC oppresses women and girls. We’ve seen suffering for a long time,” he said.

Israel enters ‘next phase of war’,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israeli-tanks-line-up-at-gazas-border-in-grim-sign-invasion-is-imminent/news-story/2b6c30746d9c7efe3d65ae3a10d3c16a,"Israel has confirmed it will send troops into Gaza and step up its strikes “today”, two weeks after the deadly terror attacks. Hamas terrorists rampaged through southern Israel on October 7, killing 1400 people and abducting around 200 hostages. In response, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and launched a massive bombing campaign, levelling entire city blocks in Gaza in preparation for a ground invasion of the tiny strip of land which is home to 2.4 million Palestinians. Read on for the latest news. Israel declares ‘next phase of war’ Israel is to immediately step up its strikes in Gaza to increase pressure on Hamas, a military spokesman told a press conference on Saturday. Israel has also massed tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks along the Gaza border for a widely anticipated ground invasion. “We have to enter the next phase of the war in the best conditions, not according to what anyone tells us. From today, we are increasing the strikes and minimising the danger,” military spokesman Admiral Daniel Hagari told a press conference. His comments came hours after the first international aid to reach Gaza since October 7 crossed the border from Egypt into the besieged Palestinian territory. In Israel, military commanders visited frontline units on Saturday. “Gaza is densely populated, the enemy is preparing a lot of things there -- but we are also preparing for them,” chief of staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi told one infantry brigade on a visit. ‘End this godawful nightmare’ Israel’s military campaign against Hamas has levelled entire city blocks in Gaza, killing more than 4,300 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. As international tensions soar, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was hosting a peace summit in Cairo on Saturday attended by regional and some Western leaders. “The time has come for action to end this godawful nightmare,” Guterres told the summit, calling for a “humanitarian ceasefire”. The region “is reeling in pain and one step from the precipice”, he added. Egypt, historically a key mediator between Hamas and Israel, has urged “restraint” and called to restart long-frozen peace talks. But diplomatic efforts to end the violence have made little headway, with Israel and its enemy Iran, a supporter of Hamas and other armed groups, among those absent from the Cairo talks. First humanitarian aid trucks enter Gaza The Rafah Crossing briefly opened between Egypt and Gaza to allow much-needed aid to be transported into the Gaza Strip, according to reports. The first trucks began arriving from Egypt shortly before 11am local time on Saturday. Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007, said a relief aid convoy of 20 trucks would enter the city carrying medicine, medical supplies and a limited amount of food and canned goods. Local Egyptian television programs showed footage of aid trucks entering Gaza through the Rafa crossing, according to Reuters. The Rafa crossing was briefly opened, allowing the passage of the convoy of trucks. It closed shortly after they passed into Gaza. The aid trucks have been stuck in Egypt for days waiting to be able to enter the embattled region. They are the first humanitarian aid trucks to help citizens in Gaza since the conflict erupted two weeks ago. Hamas’ media office said earlier on Saturday that there were 20 trucks with essential supplies due to arrive. “The relief aid convoy that is supposed to enter today includes 20 trucks that carry medicine, medical supplies, and a limited amount of food supplies,” Hamas reportedly said. However, the Hamas media office added that the truckloads of aid “will not change the catastrophic medical conditions in Gaza”. Reports: Another 13 people killed from Israeli air strike Hamas are claiming that 13 more Palestinians have been killed in an air strike at a residential unit in the city of Deir al-Balah. Reuters made the report based off Hamas media. This has not been independently verified.  Gaza hospitals ‘on brink of collapse’ Just two weeks into the Israel-Palestine conflict, hospitals in Gaza are reportedly already overflowing and way over capacity. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has warned that the region’s embattled hospitals “are on the brink of collapse”. According to the UN body, hospitals are 150 per cent capacity, causing the injured to have to lie in floors and corridors. On top of that, 60 per cent of Gaza’s primary healthcare facilities have shut down. “Only eight (out of 22) of UNRWA health centres in Middle, Khan Younis and Rafah governorates are providing primary health care services to critical outpatients and patients in need of treatment for non-communicable diseases,” the UN statement read. The situation is made more desperate as hospitals are facing shortages in power, medicine and equipment. Biden backflips on Gaza comment The White House has had to make an embarrassing backflip because US President Joe Biden misheard a question directed at him. On Friday night local time, reporters asked President Joe Biden questions about the Israel-Palestine conflict at US as he boarded Air Force One, according to Reuters. With the loud plane engines roaring, White House officials have now claimed he didn’t correctly hear a question. One reported asked President Biden if Israel should delay an invasion of Gaza until more hostages can get out. Biden replied with “Yes.” However, the White House was adamant this was not the stance of the US — so much so that they issued a statement clarifying the incident. A few hours later the White House’s press team backtracked this, blaming it on the fact President Biden did not properly hear the question. “The president was far away. He didn’t hear the full question,” White House communications director Ben LaBolt said. They claimed the questions sounded more like “Would you like to see more hostages released?” “He wasn’t commenting on anything else,” Mr LaBolt added. Humanitarian aid should arrive ‘next 24-48 hours’ About 1.4 million people have been displaced in Gaza, and more than 544,000 are sheltering in 147 UN-designated emergency shelters that are in “increasingly dire conditions,” according to a statement by the United Nation’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). More than 60% of Gaza’s population of about 2 million people are now displaced. Trucks carrying humanitarian relief are still stuck on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing into Gaza. US President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House on Friday that the trucks should enter Gaza “within the next 24-48 hours”. Palestinian protesters scream at CNN reporter CNN reporter Sara Sidner has been accosted by furious Palestinian protesters while reporting in the West Bank city of Ramallah, as tensions continue to rise in the region. During the tense confrontation, one male protester got right in Sidner’s face, called her and her network “genocide supporters,” and screamed “F--- CNN!” before Sidner was pulled away from the scene by her security team. The scene was captured on a Friday “CNN This Morning” broadcast, with the camera crew following Sidner as she toured Ramallah reporting on Palestinians raging against Israel’s war with Gaza, launched after the Hamas terrorist group raided the Israeli border, murdered civilians and took hostages. Wearing a helmet and safety vest, Sidner spoke into the camera about protesters and the Arab world at large showing “solidarity” against Israel that was “called for by Hamas.” As she continued reporting, a man wearing a scarf and green sweatshirt jumped in between Sidner and her producers, approached the reporter and began screaming, “You are genocide supporters! You are not welcome here! Genocide supporters!” Sidner remained calm and kept her voice low as the man put his face close to hers and continued yelling. Pointing a finger close to her face and pushing into her, the Palestinian demonstrator exclaimed, “F--- CNN! F--- CNN! F--- CNN! Genocide supporters!” After a few more seconds of the man yelling at Sidner, and other bystanders attempting to block her camera crew, Sidner’s team pulled her away from the man and the growing mob. -with Fox News Biden links Hamas attack to Saudi deal US President Joe Biden has linked the deadly Hamas attacks to a pending deal between Israel, US and Saudi Arabia at a fundraiser,TheTimes of Israelreports. “One of the reasons Hamas moved on Israel … they knew that I was about to sit down with the Saudis,” he said. “Guess what the Saudis wanted to recognise Israel,” he said, offering details on US efforts to broker a normalisation deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia that appear to have been put on hold following the October 7 Hamas onslaught. Saudi Arabia has been very critical of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza over the past two weeks and US officials have acknowledged that the normalisation effort is no longer their immediate focus, as they work to support Israel against Hamas. Biden officials have suggested that scuttling the normalisation effort may have been a motivation of Hamas but the president’s remarks appear the furthest anyone in his administration has gone to suggest a direct correlation. Hollywood actors pen letter to Biden A-list Hollywood celebrities including Cate Blanchett, Joaquin Phoenix, Ramy Youssef and Andrew Garfield have penned a letter to US President Joe Biden urging him to call for a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas. Dozens of top-flight names from the world of entertainment asked Biden to work to achieve an “immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost”. “We urge your administration, and all world leaders, to honour all of the lives in the Holy Land and call for and facilitate a ceasefire without delay – an end to the bombing of Gaza, and the safe release of hostages,” said the letter, released by artists4ceasefire.org. “Saving lives is a moral imperative.” Friday’s letter, which was also signed by Jon Stewart, singer Dua Lipa, Susan Sarandon and Channing Tatum, comes a week after hundreds of Hollywood figures signed an open letter condemning the “barbaric acts” committed by Hamas fighters. New details on church attack Former US politician Justin Amash has written on X that several of his relatives were killed when a Greek Orthodox Church in the Gaza Strip was hit overnight by an Israeli air strike. “Our family is hurting badly,” Amash wrote on X. “May God watch over all Christians in Gaza – and all Israelis and Palestinians who are suffering, whatever their religion or creed.” He confirmed that several of his relatives were killed at Saint Porphyrius Orthodox Church where they had been sheltering when part of the complex was destroyed. Palestinian officials said at least 500 Muslims and Christians had taken shelter from Israeli bombardments at the church, and the Hamas-run government’s health ministry said 16 were killed. The Israeli military said part of the church was damaged in a strike on a nearby militant command centre, and that it was reviewing the incident. Hamas released footage of the hostages The American hostages who were released from Hamas were seen being freed in newly released footage. Video circulating on X shows Judith Raanan and her daughter Natalie being filmed up close before they walk over to a first aid vehicle flanked by several men. In the clip, members of Hamas – whose bodies and faces are blurred – are seen taking the mother and daughter out of a car. The video then shows the pair before Hamas hands them over to the Red Cross. Biden requests $106bn for Ukraine, Israel, border US President Joe Biden requested urgent military aid for Ukraine and Israel in a massive $106 billion ($AU167bn) security package, but he faces a tough battle to get it through US Congress. Biden’s demand came a day after he drew a direct link between the Hamas attack on Israel and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine to convince Americans that the United States must show global leadership. The 80-year-old Democrat argued in an impassioned Oval Office speech that the huge sums involved – a total of $105.85 billion ($AU164bn), including $61 billion ($AU93bn) in military aid for Ukraine and $14 billion ($AU22bn) for Israel – would secure US interests for generations. But Biden’s request comes as the US House of Representatives remains in chaos, with Republicans, who hold a narrow majority, in their worst meltdown in decades and unable to elect a speaker for the past 17 days. The package also includes $7 billion ($AU11bn) for countering China and strengthening allies in the Asia-Pacific region, and over $9 billion for humanitarian assistance for Gaza, Ukraine and Israel. Most importantly, however, the huge funding ask is an attempt to bolster waning support for Ukraine by linking it with funding for Israel – which does have widespread bipartisan backing. Freed hostages ‘doing good’ A man whose daughter and granddaughter were abducted by Hamas in southern Israel says he has spoken to his daughter since her release and that he believes she will be home soon,APreports. “She’s doing good. She’s doing very good,” Uri Raanan, who is based in the Chicago suburb of Bannockburn, said. “I’m in tears, and I feel very, very good.” The 71-year-old said he saw on the news that Hamas was releasing an American mother and daughter, and he spent the day hoping they meant his daughter, Judith Raanan, and his granddaughter, 17-year-old Natalie, who live in Evanston. More hostages could be released Hamas has issued a statement saying they are working with mediators in Egypt, Qatar and other “friendly countries” “This commitment remains resolute as we endeavour to enact our decision to release individuals of foreign nationalities under temporary custody, when security circumstances permit,” the statement added. Gaza hospital told to evacuate A hospital in Gaza says they have been contacted by the Israeli army demanding the immediate evacuation of the hospital in preparation for a night-time air strike,CNNreports. The Palestinian Red Crescent also issued an urgent appeal saying it has “received a threat from the occupying authorities to bombard Al-Quds Hospital and has demanded the hospital’s immediate evacuation.” Al-Quds Hospital currently houses over 400 patients and approximately 12,000 displaced civilians who have sought refuge there as a safe haven, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The Israel Defense Forces said it requested residents in the northern area of the Gaza Strip to evacuate “in order to mitigate civilian harm.” The Palestinian Red Crescent Society urged the international community to take immediate action to prevent a potential humanitarian catastrophe similar to the tragic incident at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, which was bombed Tuesday. In a statement Friday, Gaza’s Head of the Government Media Office Salamah Marouf said “medical teams have made their decision not to respond to the occupation’s threat and not to comply with evacuation warnings. They prioritise their humanitarian role and professional duties, remaining in their positions and continuing to provide services to patients and the wounded, as well as assisting the displaced”. Israel unveils 3 stage plan Israel’s Ministry of Defence unveiled its three-phase plan to create a new “security “regime” in the Gaza Strip, announcing the first phase had begun. “We are in the first phase, in which a military campaign is taking place with [air strikes] and later with a [ground] manoeuvre with the purpose of destroying operatives and damaging infrastructure in order to defeat and destroy Hamas,” said Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. The aerial bombardment and coming ground incursion of the first phase are expected to destroy the ability of Hamas to both operate its terrorist activities and govern the civil institutions in Gaza. Speaking at a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in Tel Aviv, Gallant added that by the end of the war, Israel’s responsibility for the Gaza Strip will cease. The second phase of the war will enter “lower intensity” fighting as Israeli troops “eliminate pockets of resistance”. “The third step will be the creation of a new security regime in the Gaza Strip, the removal of Israel’s responsibility for day-to-day life in the Gaza Strip, and the creation of a new security reality for the citizens of Israel and the residents of the [area surrounding Gaza],” he said. “We will topple the Hamas organisation. We will destroy its military and governing infrastructure. It’s a phase that will not be easy. It will have a price,” he said, adding the war would be long and drawn out. “It’s not a day, it’s not a week, and unfortunately it’s not a month,” he said. Several dead in strike at Gaza church: Hamas An Israeli air strike on a Hamas command centre has damaged a church and left a number of people dead. The Hamas-controlled interior ministry said several displaced people sheltering at a church compound in Gaza were killed and injured after an Israeli strike late Thursday. The strike left a “large number of martyrs and injured” at the compound of the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church in Gaza City, the ministry said. Witnesses told AFP the strike appeared to have been aimed at a target close to the place of worship where many Gaza residents had taken refuge as the war raged in the Palestinian enclave. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets had hit a command and control centre involved in launching rockets and mortars toward Israel. “As a result of the IDF strike, a wall of a church in the area was damaged,” it said, adding “we are aware of reports on casualties. The incident is under review”. Witnesses said the strike damaged the facade of the church and caused an adjacent building to collapse, adding that many injured people were evacuated to hospital.

Saint Porphyrius is the oldest church still in use in Gaza and is located in the city’s historic neighbourhood. The Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem expressed its “strongest condemnation” of the strike at its church compound. “Targeting churches and their institutions, along with the shelters they provide to protect innocent citizens, especially children and women who have lost their homes due to Israeli air strikes on residential areas over the past 13 days, constitutes a war crime that cannot be ignored,” the Patriarchate said in a statement. The church is not far from the Al-Ahli Arab hospital, which was hit by a deadly air strike on Tuesday. Photo of US hostages released A handout photo provided by the Israeli government shows two American hostages Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie Raanan, following their release on Friday. In the photo the women are seen holding hands with Brigadier General Gal Hirsch, Israel’s co-ordinator for the captives and missing. Judith and her daughter were released due to Judith’s declining health, theTimes of Israelreported. “In response to Qatari efforts, Al-Qassam Brigades released two American citizens (a mother and her daughter) for humanitarian reasons, and to prove to the American people and the world that the claims made by Biden and his fascist administration are false and baseless,” Hamas said in a statement. The two victims were transferred from Gaza to the Israeli border by the Red Cross. US President Joe Biden said he was “overjoyed” to hear the news and had spoken on the phone to the two women after they were freed and promised they would have the government’s support “as they recover from this terrible ordeal”. No sign hospital blast was ‘Israeli strike’ France’s military intelligence agency said on Friday that there was no evidence that an Israeli strike had caused the explosion at the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. “The most probable hypothesis is that a Palestinian rocket exploded with a charge of about five kilos,” on Tuesday, the Directorate of Military Intelligence said, adding there was “nothing to indicate … an Israeli strike”. The DRM decided to make its analysis public at the request of the French presidency in the interests of transparency, it said. The DRM said it identified a hole at the blast site, not a crater, about one metre (three foot) by 75 centimetres, and 30-40 centimetres deep. “It takes about five kilograms of explosives to produce this effect, certainly less than 10 kilograms,” he said. The statement said an Israeli bomb or missile was unlikely to be behind such an impact because the minimum charge of such weaponry is much higher. A charge of five kilograms would be consistent with rockets acquired or manufactured by Palestinian groups. Since Tuesday, the Palestinians and Israelis have blamed each other for the hospital incident. Macron says France messaged Hezbollah French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday says France had been in direct contact with Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah to avoid a flare-up on Lebanon’s southern border after the attack by Hamas on Israel.

US welcomes release of hostages The US has welcomed the release of two Americans held hostage by Hamas and “shares in the relief that their families, friends and loved ones are feeling,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. “But there are still 10 additional Americans who remain unaccounted for in this conflict, Blinken continued. He added that they are among an estimated 200 others from various countries being held in Gaza, including men, women, elderly people and children. “Every single one of them should be released. ”The urgent work to free every single American, to free all other hostages, continues.” The top US diplomat said that during his recent travel to Israel, he met with loved ones of US citizens captured by Hamas. US President Joe Biden also “had the opportunity to hear directly from the families,” he said. “What I shared with the families, as the president did as well, is that the entire United States government will work every minute of every day to secure their release, to bring their loved ones home,” he said.

Hundreds gathered at Parry Park in Lakemba with fury not just for Israel but also directed at the Australian government. Lebanese Muslim Association President Hafez Alameddine told9News: “As long as they condemn some of what is happening in Palestine and Israel we are fine but nobody is saying anything and we are fed up.” The comments come as more than a dozen public protests are planned to be held in Sydney over the next seven days. A pro-Palestine march through the streets of Sydney today is expected to attract over 5000 attendees. “We aware of at this stage up to 17 protest events not just in the city, not just in the CBD but other parts of the Sydney metropolitan area and outer areas,” NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb told reporters on Friday. “So it is a dynamic situation and we will be dealing with those matters (as they) become known to us.” Frydenberg labels protesters ‘national disgrace’ Former Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has condemned anti-Semitic protests on the Sydney Opera House steps as an “abomination”, in his first comments since the Hamas terror attack on southern Israel. The prominent member of the Jewish community made the remarks in a speech in support of victims of terrorism, which was published inThe Weekend Australian. He said he never believed he would feel as his grandparents did amid the rising tide of Jewish hatred that heralded the Holocaust, nor as his parents did amid the threat to Israel posed by the Yom Kippur War in 1973. “But now I do,” he said. “I stand before you anguished and anxious about the future.” “When fears over safety see Jewish students afraid to attend lectures on campus, Jewish parents feel the need to keep their children home from school, and Jewish schools advise students not to wear their uniforms that makes them identifiable outside school grounds we know we have a problem. “And when hundreds of demonstrators in Sydney chant ‘f. k the Jews’ and ‘gas the Jews’ we know just how dangerous and ­serious that problem really is. “What happened last week outside the Sydney Opera House was nothing short of an abomination. “A national disgrace that has become an international embarrassment.” Two American hostages released by Hamas Two American hostages abducted by Hamas in early October have been released “for humanitarian reasons”, the terrorist group announced Friday. “In response to Qatari efforts, Al-Qassam Brigades released two American citizens (a mother and her daughter) for humanitarian reasons, and to prove to the American people and the world that the claims made by Biden and his fascist administration are false and baseless,” Hamas said in a statement, according to theTimes of Israel. Judith Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter Natalie, were both released and are en route to a military base in central Israel to meet their family, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later confirmed on X. The two victims were transferred from Gaza to the Israeli border by the Red Cross, the officials added. The Raanans were released due to Judith’s declining health, theTimes of Israelreported. The women were taken hostage when Hamas stormed Kibbutz Nahal Oz 13 days ago, the outlet previously reported. They were enjoying a “really special” trip to Israel to celebrate a relative’s birthday and observe the Jewish holiday season when the Hamas war started, their rabbi, Meir Hecht, told the outlet. The Raanans’ release was “hopefully the start of more to come”, a diplomatic source told CNN. The same source also confirmed that there were no exchanges involved in the release, the outlet noted. The Israeli military said earlier on Friday that most of those abducted to Gaza were still alive. “The majority of the hostages are alive. There were also dead bodies that were taken … to the Gaza Strip,” an army statement said. The military said more than 20 hostages were minors, while between 10 and 20 were over the age of 60. There are also between 100 and 200 people considered missing since the Hamas attacks, the army added. — NY Post Grim sign Gaza invasion imminent Israeli troops and tanks have amassed near the border amid fears of a full-scale ground invasion. Increased military activity was reported in the area with footage showing tanks on the move near Gaza around sunrise local time. It comes after Israel‘s defence chief Yoav Gallant told troops they will soon see Gaza “from the inside.” The minister wished the men luck as he said “there is no forgiveness” for the Hamas‘ horror attack. He told the soldiers: “There is no forgiveness for this thing. Only total annihilation of Hamas organisation, terror infrastructures, everything that has to do with terrorists and whoever sent them. “It will take a week, it will take a month, it will take two months, until we eliminate them. “You are not alone in battle. We trust you and count on you. “Carry on training while there is time, get organised, be prepared, the command will come. Thanks guys, we count on you, good luck. “And anyone who now sees Gaza from a distance will soon see it from inside, I promise you.” Aid trucks waiting to cross into Gaza Trucks of international aid for Gaza should be rolling “in the next day or so”, the United Nations said Friday, with Palestinians desperate for lifesaving supplies after sustained bombing from Israel, still reeling from its bloodiest-ever attack. Some 175 lorries crammed with vital medicines, food, and water stretched into the distance at the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has removed concrete roadblocks and is scrambling to repair the route into besieged Gaza — the only one not controlled by Israel. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Islamist militant group launched an unprecedented raid from the Gaza Strip on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians shot, mutilated or burned to death, according to Israeli officials. Hamas gunmen also kidnapped some 200 hostages including foreigners from around two dozen countries ranging from Paraguay to Tanzania. The majority are still alive, the Israeli army said Friday. In response, Israeli bombers have levelled entire city blocks in Gaza in preparation for a ground invasion they say is coming soon. The Hamas-run health ministry said 4,137 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the onslaught. Israeli jets pounded more than 100 Hamas targets in Gaza overnight, the army said, with AFP reporters hearing loud explosions and witnessing plumes of smoke billowing from the northern Gaza Strip. Embracing frontline soldiers and clad in body armour, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged them to “fight like lions” and “win with full force”. Fists clenched and voice raised, Netanyahu told cheering troops: “We will deal harsh blows to our enemies in order to achieve victory.” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told some of the tens of thousands of personnel preparing the ground invasion that “the order will come soon.” ‘Beyond catastrophic’ UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Rafah crossing to personally oversee preparations, as workmen operating bulldozers on the Gazan side battled to make the road passable. A spokesman for UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told reporters in Geneva a first delivery was due “in the next day or so”, following a deal clinched by US President Joe Biden to allow 20 trucks of aid for civilians. Medicine, water purifiers and blankets were being unloaded at El Arish airport near Gaza, an AFP reporter saw, with Ahmed Ali, head of the Egyptian Red Crescent, saying he was getting “two to three planes of aid a day”. But World Health Organisation emergencies director Michael Ryan said Biden’s 20-truck deal was “a drop in the ocean of need” and that 2,000 trucks were required. The UN says more than one million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people are displaced, with the humanitarian situation “beyond catastrophic” and deteriorating daily. Refugees from northern Gaza told harrowing tales of bombs, profiteering, and extreme temperatures as whole families trekked on foot to flee the violence. Mother of seven Fadwa Al-Najjar walked for 10 hours with her family from northern Gaza to reach a UN camp in the southern town of Khan Yunis, saying she saw cars hit by a strike on the road just in front of them. “We saw bodies and limbs torn off and we just started praying, thinking we were going to die,” she said. ‘It’s unimaginable’ On the other side of the conflict, the full horror of what Israel suffered on October 7 and following days was still emerging, as traumatised residents recounted their stories. Shachar Butler, a security chief at the Nir Oz kibbutz, where Hamas militants killed or kidnapped a quarter of the 400 residents, recalls more than a dozen gunmen spraying bullets indiscriminately and lobbing grenades at homes. “It’s unimaginable,” the 40-year-old told AFP as part of a trip organised by the Israeli military. “Anytime someone tried to touch my window, I shot him,” he said. “The people who came out got kidnapped, killed, executed, slaughtered.” Butler estimated as many as 200 militants attacked the kibbutz, entering from three sides before going house-to-house. Homes there were still charred with burned personal belongings strewn everywhere. Israel says around 1,500 Hamas fighters were killed in clashes before its army regained control of the areas under attack. ‘45 of us gone’ During a rare Oval Office address, Biden vowed the United States would take the lead in supporting Israel and Ukraine, saying he would make an “urgent” request to Congress for aid later Friday. Fresh from a whirlwind trip to Israel this week, Biden is hoping to staunch the possibility of a wider Middle East war. The United States has moved two aircraft carriers into the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iran or Lebanon’s Hezbollah, both Hamas allies, from getting involved. The conflict has inflamed passions across the region, with protests planned in several countries and Hamas urging demonstrators to target Israeli and US embassies. Both sides traded blame for deadly strikes, the latest coming at a church compound in Gaza late Thursday. The Hamas-controlled interior ministry said several people sheltering at the church were killed and wounded, blaming an Israeli strike. The Israeli army acknowledged a wall of the church had been damaged in one of its air strikes targeting a “command and control centre belonging to a Hamas terrorist” and said the incident was “under review”. “This place is dedicated for praying, a place of love and peace,” said witness Abu Khalil Jahshan. “There is no safe place here in Gaza.” Meanwhile, Gaza students in Egypt told AFP of their nightmare watching events unfold from far away. Haya Shehab, 21, learned from an Instagram post that her extended family’s home had been bombed, killing 45 people — dozens of them cousins. “Just like that, 45 of us gone,” said Shehab, who studies at a private university in Cairo Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Israel falls right into Hamas’ evil trap,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/in-its-lust-for-justice-israel-is-doing-exactly-what-hamas-wants-and-guaranteeing-another-generation-of-misery/news-story/fb893b5e1c69a5d4bc0743861fd541cc,"COMMENT “A crime against humanity isn’t just about killing humans. It is about destroying our trust in humanity,” the Israeli historian Yuval Harari said last week. “When you witness things like parents being tortured and executed in front of their children, or toddlers being brutally murdered, you lose all trust in human beings. And you thereby risk losing your own humanity too.” By that measure, the atrocities Hamas militants committed in southern Israel earlier this month achieved their goal. We have all lost a little humanity in the fallout, be it thosecelebrating the wanton butchery of children, those excusing the mounting suffering of Palestinian civilians, or those of us somewhere in the middle, wrestling with our righteous fury without quite managing to master it. These next quotes come from Tzipi Hotovely, Israel’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, upon being asked about the escalating “humanitarian crisis” in the Gaza Strip. “Are you a mother?” Ms Hotovely replied, addressing Sky News host Kay Burley, her voice shaking with emotion. “What would you think if your children would have been executed in front of your eyes? Would you expect your government to think about those Nazis committing those crimes and to say, ‘Wait a second, first of all we need to protect the enemy, and then we need to protect our children? “Your children come as priority to your prime minister. Do you know that?” The question was specifically about Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza with dwindling access to food, water and medicine – this was before very limited aid was allowed to start trickling across Gaza’s border with Egypt. Ms Hotovely responded by lumping those civilians in with “the enemy”. She was indignant, appalled, furious that the question was even being asked. It’s unusual for a professional diplomat to speak so intemperately about anything. But to answer her core challenge: I would expect any government acting in my name to think clearly. To plan ahead. Not to rush in and make a horrifying situation even worse. And yes, I would expect it to consider civilian lives. That is what separates legitimate nations from terrorists. Israel’s reaction is understandable; it’s human nature to demand decisive action after being victimised. But Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is doing exactly what Hamas wanted. It is behaving emotionally, not rationally. The particularly sickening nature of Hamas’s crimes – the beheadings, the burnt bodies, the murdered babies – were terrorism 101: they were designed to provoke. To horrify and enrage Israel so much that it would act rashly. Peace is an existential threat to Hamas, something it can never accept, which means it must foment violence. And that means not just committing acts of violence itself, but provoking Israel to do the same, until peace is no longer an option for anyone. The only lasting result of Israel retaliating against Hamas by levelling neighbourhoods and, potentially, launching a ground invasion of Gaza, will be the deaths of innocent people in their thousands and the complete radicalisation of a new generation of Palestinians. And so the cycle of violence continues. And Hamas wins. This is how terrorism operates, by exploiting human nature and eroding your soul until it successfully drags you down to its level, into the moral gutter. Every fibre of your being tells you that atrocities like those we saw in southern Israel need to be repaid. It’s so, so difficult and counterintuitive to choose restraint. But you must keep the end goal in mind, and work towards it. And what is the end goal here? It has to be peace. Ithasto be. Not with Hamas – that’s impossible – but with the Palestinians more broadly. Mr Netanyahu has never seemed particularly interested in a lasting, sustainable peace. He thought he could keep the Palestinians in their cage, and maintain the status quo indefinitely, safely behind the shield of the Iron Dome and the IDF. He fell victim to hubris. For years, Israel has undermined the peace process with the more moderate Palestinian political faction, Fatah, which governs the West Bank and supports a negotiated two-state solution. Mr Netanyahu has simultaneously enabled Hamas, which seeks Israel’s total destruction, allowing it to be propped up by cash from Gulf states. The idea, ashe reportedly told colleaguesfrom his political party back in 2019, was to keep the Palestinians divided, and hence keep a sovereign Palestinian state off the table. “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,” Mr Netanyahu said. “This is part of our strategy: to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.” Not a great idea, it transpires. What Israel should have done, and should try to do in the longer term now, is demonstrate that it’s serious about working with Palestinians who choose diplomacy over bloodshed. If you back desperate people into a box, if you convince them the peaceful option will lead nowhere, you are driving them towards violence. It doesn’t excuse that violence. But it’s bad, counter-productive, shortsighted strategy. Mr Netanyahu’s government has repeatedly made peace-minded Palestinian leaders look like impotent fools, and made their approach look like a dead end. All that does is add legitimacy, in some Palestinians’ eyes, to Hamas’s twisted alternative of a bloody struggle to the death. It cannot continue, or we’ll be back here in 20 years discussing another terrorist atrocity and another disproportionate response, and another radicalised generation. And again 20 years after that. Obviously, Hamas needs to be crippled, but at the same time the Israeli government must find a way to demonstrate that its genuine end goal is peaceful coexistence, and yes, a stable Palestinian state. Mr Netanyahu is incapable of doing that. What we need from Israel right now, most of all, is for it to avoid the trap of dehumanising its enemy. Not all Palestinians support Hamas.Recent polling showedgreater popularity for Fatah than the current Hamas regime among Gazans, plus 50 per cent support for accepting Israel’s existence and seeking a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. These people are among those whose homes are being destroyed, whose children and spouses and friends are dying under Israeli bombardment. You often hear that Gazans elected Hamas, as though that makes them complicit, and quasi-legitimate targets. That election was in 2006, and there hasn’t been another since. About half the people now living in Gaza were either children or not yet born at the time. The context of that election is important as well: Hamas primarily ran on a platform of change, arguing Fatah was corrupt and had made no progress during its time in power. When you start to conflate the civilians with the militants and assume they’re all the same, as Ms Hotovely sadly did in that interview – those are the early seeds of genocide. And genocide is Hamas’s goal here, not Israel’s. Israel is a democratic nation, it has signed up to international law, and it needs to hold itself to that standard. It must. Be. Better. Than the reckless violence it’s fighting against. And it’s the international community’s job to ensure that happens. “Outsiders who are not themselves immersed in pain should make an effort to empathise with all suffering humans, rather than lazily seeing only part of the terrible reality,” wrote Professor Harariin his article last week. “It is the job of outsiders to help maintain a space for peace. We deposit this peaceful space with you, because we cannot hold it right now. Take good care of it for us, so that one day, when the pain begins to heal, both Israelis and Palestinians might inhabit that space.” Hamas is not a reasonable organisation; its moral vacuum is a given. Israel is the only actor in this war with the potential to take the moral high ground, to sacrifice its catharsis for a greater good. It can either make challenging choices, or play into Hamas’s hands and keep the cycle of soul-destroying, pointless violence spinning. We do Israel no favours by egging it on.

Two US hostages released by Hamas,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/american-mother-daughter-taken-hostage-in-israel-released-by-hamas/news-story/708f2cf22969f48a607af458fa79a9ba,"An American mother and daughter who were taken hostage when Hamas stormed the kibbutz they were visiting earlier this month have been released. Judith Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, were both let go from Hamas custody in Gaza and were said to be en route to a military base in central Israel to reunite with their family, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuconfirmed on X. A photograph later showed the mother and daughter being escorted through the night by what appeared to be military officials. Prior to Mr Netanyahu’s statement, Hamas officials said that they released the two women following Qatar’s intervention in negotiation efforts,theNY Postreports. “In response to Qatari efforts, Al-Qassam Brigades released two American citizens (a mother and her daughter) for humanitarian reasons, and to prove to the American people and the world that the claims made by Biden and his fascist administration are false and baseless,” the announcement read, according to theTimes of Israel. The two victims were transferred from Gaza to the Israeli border by the Red Cross, the officials added. They were released due to Judith’s declining health, theTimes of Israelreported. Natalie Raanan could be back in the States early next week, her brother Bentold CNN. “We have heard tentatively that she might be coming back to Chicago sometime early next week,” he said, adding that he heard of their release through the media. “This all moved so quickly, I was getting texts from reporters I met with saying this happened. I believe it’s because the government didn’t want to call us before it had been confirmed.” US PresidentJoe Bidenspoke with the Raanans after their release, he announced on X. “I just spoke with the two Americans released today after being held hostage by Hamas. I let them know that their government will fully support them as they recover and heal,” he said. “Jill and I will continue holding close in our hearts all the families of unaccounted for Americans.” In a statement earlier in the day, the commander in chief said, “Our fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear.” “I thank the government of Qatar and the government of Israel for their partnership in this work,” he added. “And, as I told those families when I spoke with them last week — we will not stop until we get their loved ones home. As president, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans held hostage around the world.” Judith and Natalie, from Evanston, Illinois, were taken hostage when Hamas stormed Kibbutz Nahal Oz 13 days ago, it was previously reported. Their release is “hopefully the start of more to come”, a diplomatic source told CNN. The same source also confirmed that there were no exchanges involved in the release, the outlet noted. “The families’ headquarters welcomes the release of hostages from Hamas captivity,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum — which represents the relatives of the Hamas hostages — said in a statement sent to CNN. “The continued holding of hostages is a war crime. Hundreds of families await the assistance of leaders of Arab states after Hamas’ actions shocked the entire world,” the write-up continued. “Hamas committed war crimes. Many leaders in Arab states have tremendous influence over its leaders and must act to immediately release all the hostages and missing held in Gaza.” Uri Raanan, Natalie’s father and Judith’s ex-husband, could not immediately be reached byThe Postfor comment. Since his daughter and former spouse went missing, Uri Raanan, who also lives in Illinois, has maintained aFacebook pagecovered in pleas for the pair’s release. He also opened a GoFundMe for the effort, which stopped accepting donations sometime late Thursday or early Friday. The Raanans were enjoying a “really special” trip to Israel to celebrate the 85th birthday of Judith’s mother and observe the Jewish holiday season when the Hamas war started, their rabbi, Meir Hecht, told the outlet. The mother and daughter’s family members have also been informed, the report added. “This is a huge sigh of relief,” relative Martin Fletcher, an NBC correspondent who once covered the Middle East and was the network’s Tel Aviv bureau chief,told MSNBC. “It’s a miracle.” Ben Raanantold NewsNationthat he thinks he’s “just going to hug them and just not let them go … I don’t think there are words to describe the emotions that we’re going to be feeling” when he’s finally reunited with his sister and stepmum. Armed terrorists from Hamas took at least 203 people — including young children and the elderly — captive and killed hundreds more during the early-morning launch of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7. The deadly raid — which started when Hamas stormed through the border crossing between southern Israel and the Gaza Strip and launched thousands of rockets in the space of just a couple hours — kicked off the Israel-Hamas war that has since killed over 1400 Israelis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli officials have vowed to wipe out Hamas while also working to rescue the hostages, many of whom were believed to be held in the terror group’s tunnel system underneath Gaza. At one point, Hamas suggested that the hostages could be exchanged for the approximately 6000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. The group also stated that over 20 hostages had been killed by Israeli air strikes, but did not provide further details. Israel subsequently announced that its formidable blockade of the Strip would not end until all the hostages were released. Hopeful viewers, however, should be careful not to trust Hamas’ “humanitarian” angle on releasing the Raanans, former FBI agent and hostage team expert Christopher O’Leary toldThe Post. “They are doing this for calculated reasons,” Mr O’Leary insisted, noting that “Hamas does not have a humanitarian bone in their body”. “This was not a goodwill or good faith gesture … they are playing a long game with the hostages,” he added. “They may be doing it to build some credibility in negotiations, [because] right now they do not seem like a legitimate negotiator. “It also could be a counternarrative to what Biden put out yesterday, going directly after Hamas and categorising them as a terrorist organisation.” “Hamas is the quintessential terrorist organisation,” Mr O’Leary concluded. On October 20 — nearly two weeks after the initial Hamas attack — the Israel Defense Forces also confirmed that more than 20 of the hostages were under the age of 18, with another 10 to 20 over age 60,TheWall Street Journalreported. At the time, the IDF also said it had reason to believe that the majority of the hostages were still alive — though it was still scanning the Gaza border for bodies of missing Israelis, spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said at a press conference, per theTimes of Israel. Several hostages were believed to have been taken from the attack on the Tribe of Nova music festival in the southern Negev, where 260 people were gunned down when Hamas stormed the outdoor concert area. One of the festival captives,Mia Shem, appeared alive in a brief clip on October 16 and detailed a harrowing three-hour surgery in Gaza before begging for her release. “They are taking care of me, giving me medicine, everything is fine. I only ask that they bring me home as soon as possible to my parents, to my siblings,” the 21-year-old pleaded. “Get me out of here as soon as possible. Please.” The families of the hostages have spoken out frequently both individually and through Bring Them Home Now, an organisation that was created to represent the loved ones of the missing. Amid their agony, many of them expressed frustration with the Israeli government. “Every second, every second, that our children are there is one second too much, and yet all [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu talks about is ‘winning the war,’” Hadas Kalderon, whose son, daughter, mother and niece were taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, told theWashington Post. On October 18, Kalderon learned that her mother, Carmela, and her niece, Noya, were both dead. There was still no information about her son, Erez, 12, or her 16-year-old daughter, Sahar. “We are simple people; we are good citizens. We gave whatever we could to our country. It’s the Israeli government that just forgot us,” she lamented.

Greta deletes pro-Palestine pic after backlash,https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/completely-unaware-greta-thunberg-deletes-propalestinian-post-featuring-antisemitic-trope/news-story/12b41fae3251f63569df721b61eeef1d,"Greta Thunberg was accused by Israeli officials of being a “terror supporter” on Friday after posting pro-Palestinian messages — initially featuring a toy octopus, a known anti-Semitic trope. The 20-year-old ecowarrior posted a photo of her holding a “Stand with Gaza” sign alongside three friends — one holding a “Free Palestine” sign — while calling a strike “in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza”,theNY Postreports. With them was a toy octopus — a symbol often used in anti-Jewish propaganda since being used in a Nazi-era cartoon. TheTime“Person of the Year” honoree later deleted the photo, replacing it with an almost identical one — just without the offensive symbol, about which she protested innocence. “It has come to my knowledge that the stuffed animal shown in my earlier post can be interpreted as a symbol for anti-Semitism, which I was completely unaware of,” she said. Instead, the ecowarrior — who has previously discussed being on the autism spectrum — claimed that “the toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings”. “We are of course against any type of discrimination, and condemn anti-Semitism in all forms and shapes. This is non-negotiable. That is why I deleted the last post,” she insisted. Her messaging — even without the octopus — drew disgusted condemnation from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Arye Sharuz Shalicar. “Whoever identifies with Greta in any way in the future, in my view, is a terror supporter,” the enraged IDF officialtoldPolitico. “Because what Greta is doing, that she is now showing solidarity with Gaza while not saying a word about the massacres of Israelis, shows that she is not in favour of the Palestinians, but that she is sweeping the terror of the Palestinians or Hamas and Islamic Jihad under the table as if it did not exist.” Other officials also ripped Ms Thunberg, who also shared an Instagram post from a German-based Palestinian group that called Israel’s retaliatory air strikes on the Gaza Strip a “genocide”. “It is not the octopus that makes this all tweet feel very anti-Semitic … It is the [complete] denial of torturing, raping, beheading, and kidnapping thousands of Israelis,” Israeli diplomat Dana Filber wrote. Former journalist Doron Herman shared a graphic that read “Greta Thunberg Supports ISIS” in bold letters. “You say you are against anti-Semitism, yet you can’t say a word to condemn Hamas or express solidarity for the 1400 people — including children — they have slaughtered,” human rights lawyer and self-described “proud Zionist” Arsen Ostrovsky also replied to Thunberg’s X post. Hamas, which is based in the Gaza Strip, frequently has been compared to ISIS since its attack on Israel. Mr Shalicar later walked back his comments on Ms Thunberg’s supporters, tellingPoliticothat he “spoke out of a deep sense of pain and [his] words do not reflect my personal views or those of the IDF”. The backlash against Ms Thunberg’s Gaza stance comes just three days after she was arrested at an anti-oil protest outside a five-star hotel in London on Tuesday. She was charged with a public order offence, and was released on bail until a November 15 hearing at the Westminster Magistrates’ Court.

‘Annihilation’: Israel war could lead to WWIII,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hamas-attack-on-israel-could-lead-to-world-war-three-and-human-annihilation-experts-warn/news-story/cf9ec8c9965efda12516720b3aab307b,"With thousands dead and major global powers flying into Israel, analysts are now predicting the Israel-Hamas war could develop into World War Three. Experts tell news.com.au that this worst-case scenario would likely see the conflict envelop China, Russia and the United States. The bloody war has so far left more than 1400 dead in Israel and more than 3785 Palestinians killed in retaliatory strikes. Israel now appears to be on thebrink of launching a ground invasionof the Gaza Strip with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying in a fiery speech there would be “no forgiveness” for the attacks on Israel, “only total annihilation of Hamas organisation”. Founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt The militant Palestinian group operates alongside Islamic Jihad and is supported by Iran Hamas does not recognise Israel’s right to exist “Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.” – Hamas charter A 2021 Israeli assessment reportedly found it had a 30,000-strong army, including 400 naval commandos Despite Israeli blockades, its arsenal at the time was put at 7000 rockets, as well as 300 anti-tank and 100 anti-aircraft missiles Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh says the current attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip–Operation Al-Aqsa Flood–will expand to the West Bank and Jerusalem Historian Niall Ferguson wrote inThe Timesthat the situation had an “unpleasant 1930s feel”, asking: “Will there be a World War Three?”. “If Israel finds it cannot contend with a three-front war in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, and turns to the United States for military help against Iran, we shall have reached one of history’s hinges,” he wrote starkly. “The future of the world will turn on it.” Global order is collapsing - could lead to ‘annihilation’ Historian Yuval Noah Harari has warned that the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ukraine war and now the Israel-Hamas war points towards increasing geo-political chaos. “Generally, order is collapsing and is being replaced by chaos,” he told NDTV. “This has been happening for the past five to 10 years. We see it in more and more places now. The (Covid) pandemic was a part of it. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is also a part of it.” “What’s happening now in Israel and Palestine is a part of it.” Noted as one of the world’s leading scholars, Mr Harari warned that order needed to be rebuilt - or the situation would only further detetioriate. “It will spread all over the world”, he said. “It could lead to Third World War. And with the type of weapons and technology now available, it could lead to the annihilation of humankind itself.” ‘Not in isolation’ While the Israel-Hamas war may seem far away, national security lecturer at Charles Sturt University Dr Levi West told news.com.au that the conflict could have major global repercussions. “What happened doesn’t just happen in isolation,” he warned. “It happens in the context of Iranian sponsorship of Hamas, Russia’s close relationship with Iran over weapons and in the context of broader US-Russia-China competition and geopolitics.” In the last week alone both China and Russia have hardened their positions against Israel, in what appears to be a direct attempt to undermine the US. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said Israel’s bombings had gone “beyond the scope of self-defence” and that it “should stop collective punishment of the people of Gaza”. Meanwhile, Russia appears to have little interest in solving the crisis. US Foreign policy expert Josh Rogin wrote inThe Washington Postthat Russia’s main foreign policy goal now appears to be to “distract the world from its ongoing invasion and atrocities in Ukraine”. “Specifically Moscow is pushing for US military assistance to Ukraine to end… the crisis in Israel aids these efforts,” he wrote. “Russia has stepped up its support for Hamas diplomatically and in the propaganda war; it’s also seizing the opportunity to ramp up its violence in Ukraine, while the world is distracted.” Research scholar at the Centre of Arab and Islamic Studies at ANU Ian Parmeter told news.com.au that Russia’s growing strategic relationship with Iran further complicates matters. “Iran has become an important supplier of ammunition and weapons to Russia, particularly drones in the Ukraine war,” he said. While Mr Parmeter doubted Russia would directly become involved in the Gaza conflict he said it would be “looking for opportunities to benefit from the situation”. “The Middle East is a second order priority for Russia. A superpower war is more likely because of a miscalculation by either the US or Russia in Ukraine, which is far more important to Russia than the Middle East.” Iran a major player in global conflict What Iran does next could prove the deciding factor. Many believe Iran was pushing Hamas to act now to undermine the chances of a mega US-Israel-Saudi Arabia deal being sealed that would dramatically tilt the strategic landscape in the Middle East. Iran appears highly agitated that the region was slipping out of its orbit. Just days before the Hamas attack, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Kahmenaei, according toThe Economist, warned that countries establishing relations with Israel were putting themselves in harm’s way. Mr Parmeter said the main country at risk of becoming involved in the conflict with Israel in the short-term is Lebanon. “Conflict with Israel would be through the Shia militia Hezbollah,” he said. “Iran controls Hezbollah and supplies it with weapons and training through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. “Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, claims to have some 100,000 fighters. More seriously for Israel, Hezballah is understood to have between 120,000 and 150,000 rockets, which it could fire at Israeli cities.” “Hezbollah won’t become involved unless Iran directs it to.” US ‘appeasement lite’ strategy And if Israel cannot hold off Hezbollah it may call on the US on the ground. While the US may be reluctant to send troops it could be left with no choice. As Niall Ferguson noted there are some “powerful economic and political forces steering the US towards a kind of ‘appeasement lite’ in particular the perception that US voters care more about their domestic economic situation than about new ‘forever wars’”. “As has been clear from Joe Biden’s handling of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, nothing worries the US president more that he might inadvertently stumble into a Third World War,” he wrote. “The irony is of course, that it was appeasement and the failure of deterrence that led the West into the Second World War.” -with AFP carla.mascarenhas@news.com.au To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Three words reignite Australia’s Israel debate,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/senator-wongs-three-words-have-reignited-israel-debate/news-story/9faa1ec685509733f8d689238686f071,"Who started it? In the case of theIsrael-Arab conflict, the answer is lost in millennia of religious, ethnic and nationalist disputes. And yet uninvolved governments, institutions, corporations and individuals are expected to take sides. The current incarnation of the battle to dominate the Holy Land can be attributed to a United Nations General Assembly resolution from 1947. It was a resolution Australia’s then External Affairs Minister Herbert Evatt played a central role in formulating. And it clearly divided theBritish Mandate of Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish nation states, with the holy city of Jerusalem placed under international jurisdiction. The idea fell apart even before it was implemented. Fighting between Jewish settlers and dispossessed Palestinians rapidly escalated to war involving the surrounding Arab nations in 1948. Things haven’t improved much since. Immense emotional baggage afflicts both sides of this relationship. “On the Jewish Israeli side, deep-rooted existential fears, following millennia of persecution, pogroms and the trauma of the Holocaust, were later exacerbated by a number of mostly defensive wars fought against neighbouring Arab states,” says University of Sydney conflict studies lecturer Dr Eyal Mayroz. “On the Palestinian side, experiences of dispossession, injustice, deprivation, daily humiliation, endless violations of rights and a sense of abandonment by the world – including by Arab states – have caused immeasurable despair.” Global opinion is generally divided along cultural, political and religious lines. “Once we choose to support a side in a conflict, we may go to great lengths to defend its actions,” says Mayroz. “New information, processed through our filters and conditioned responses, can be used to challenge, or cast doubt, on any claim made by the other side. The more emotionally invested we become in the cause, the harder it is for us to empathise with the suffering experienced across the fence.” But it’s also a scenario where both Palestinian and Israeli civilians are victims. And both Palestinian and Israeli nations are perpetrators of extreme violence. Now, after 75 years of ceaseless conflict, both are suffering a crises of legitimacy. Australia’s choice “In the century-long feud between the two sides over land, there’s been little respite from violence,” argues Mayroz. “Competing territorial claims continue to fuel duelling narratives of victimisation. These foment anger, animosity, fear and mistrust. Colossal leadership errors on both sides during historical junctures have led to missed opportunities to resolve a conflict that becomes more intractable by the year.” Australia has traditionally been a loyal friend of the state of Israel. But not without reservations. In August, Foreign Minister Penny Wong clarified the relationship by reinstating the term “Occupied Palestinian Territories” when referencing the ongoing conflict. In diplomacy, words are weapons. And this signalled the Federal Labor Government’s condemnation of Israel’s ongoing expansion into land partitioned for Palestinian Arabs. But Labor hasn’t gone so far as to endorse the original UN resolution calling for the recognition of a nation-state of Palestine. “Since 1948, Israel has derived much of its legitimacy from its status as a sovereign state,” says Deakin University lecturer in Middle East Studies Dr Andrew Thomas. “As a state, it has a recognised right to protect its borders, hold legitimate elections, make its own laws and use force to defend itself.” Palestine does not have these internationally recognised rights. “They have spent the bulk of their political history trying to achieve self-determination,” argues Thomas. “Without self-determination, Palestinians derive their political legitimacy from their struggle against the Israeli occupation in both the West Bank and Gaza.” So how did the world get into this mess? The world was shocked at the holocaust unleashed on the Jewish people by Nazi Germany. Film and photos exposed the industrialised scale of this institutionalised campaign of murder. And the testimony of returning troops and immigrating death camp survivors brought home the reality of the horror. This motivated the fledgling United Nations to finally do something about the chaotic situation in the Levant that had resulted from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The General Assembly resolved to re-establish the nation of Israel which had been destroyed by the Roman Empire more than 1800 years earlier. And this would exist alongside a new Palestinian state. But things didn’t turn out so well. The 1948 war resulted in 750,000 Palestinians being forced into exile after Israel annexed large tracts of Palestinian land. And subsequent wars, treaties, ceasefires, UN resolutions, and International Court rulings have only further muddied the waters. For example, the International Criminal Court in 2021 vaguely redefined the Palestinian State as “territory occupied since 1967” when Israel “pre-emptively” invaded the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, Egypt’s Sinai and Syria’s Golan Heights. But few nations accepted this ruling on the grounds it was territorial gain resulting from military action – something forbidden by Article 49 of the 1949 Geneva Convention. “For most countries in Europe and in the Americas, the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) are the “West Bank” including East Jerusalem, areas which they consider central to Palestinian self-determination through statehood,” explains the University of Wollongong’s Professor Gregory Rose who is also director of research for The Hague Initiative for International Cooperation. He adds that Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, and many Islamic countries refuse to recognise Israel’s right to exist. But he also says Israel has legal arguments besides the International Criminal Court ruling to justify its controversial settlements. “Palestine was not a state at the time Israel captured the West Bank of Jordan,” he says. “Thus, in 1967, Palestine was not a sovereign state to which the 1949 Geneva Convention could apply. “The Israeli legal position is that those areas captured by Israel from Jordan in 1967 are “disputed” territories. This position is held in common with the previous Australian government, the US, and several other countries.” Canberra’s balancing act “Australia’s diplomacy in the Middle East is marked by a delicate balancing act,” says Charles Sturt University political scientist Professor Sally Totman. “On one hand, it maintains strong alliances with Western nations, particularly the United States, and supports international efforts to combat terrorism. On the other hand, it seeks to cultivate relationships with Middle Eastern countries, many of which have complex geopolitical dynamics and differing views on regional issues, including the ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict.” Professor Totmay points out that Australia still has a military presence in and around the Holy Land. Operation Paladin is a presence in Israel as part of the UN Truce Supervision Organisation. Operation Mazurka is its contribution to the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai. Operation Fortitude is Australia’s involvement in the UN Disengagement Observer Force in Syria. Operation Okra is the ADF’s mission to support ongoing Coalition efforts against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “For Australia, balancing its strategic interests with its commitment to human rights and democratic values remains a delicate task,” says Totman. “The shifting dynamics in global politics, including the reconfiguration of alliances, requires Australia to assess its relationship with, and policies towards, the Middle East with a long-term strategic approach.” The United Nations General Assembly in 2012 granted Palestine full status as a nation-state. The then Gillard government abstained from that vote. And Australia is yet to formally recognise the move. But Senator Wong’s recent rewording of Australia’s diplomatic lexicon to include “Occupied Palestinian Territories” has reignited the debate. “In adopting the term, we are clarifying that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and Gaza, were occupied by Israel following the 1967 war and that the occupation continues and reaffirms our commitment to negotiate a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist,” Senator Wong said. No mention was made of Evatt’s original 1948 UN Partition Plan. 1948, 1967 … or something else? “The world has lost hope in the viability of proposed solutions currently on the table,” argues Dr Mayroz, who believes the two-state policy has been dealt a severe blow by the current crisis. “As meaningful negotiations have not been carried out for years, how helpful, really, is such a policy for advancing a resolution to the conflict?” he asks. The alternative, however, is equally fraught with risk. How does combining the Holy Land into a single one-size-fits-all state avoid sliding down the path of oppressive apartheid? How can intractable religious, ethnic and political divides be balanced? What processes can be implemented to resolve 75 years’ worth of land ownership disputes? And is either side in a moral position to negotiate anyway? Hamas – already recognised as a terrorist organisation by Canberra – has lost much of its remaining international legitimacy through its latest massacre of Israeli civilians. But it’s also lost legitimacy among its own people. While democratically elected to govern Gaza 17 years ago, it has not held a vote since. It blames Israel’s blockade for making it impossible to do so. Israel rejects this. And polls indicate Hamas’ popularity has plummeted to just 11 per cent after repeatedly using Palestinian civilians as human shields. Israel’s government also has legitimacy problems. “Its decades of occupation and settlement in the Palestinian territories have brought into question its moral authority,” argues Dr Thomas. And its recent policy of ignoring Palestine while improving relations with surrounding Arab countries appears to have failed. “The Hamas attacks show how complacent the Israeli government has become about its own political and moral legitimacy,” Thomas adds. “In neglecting its obligation to find an equitable solution to the conflict, the government has put both Israeli and Palestinian lives in danger. “Hamas’s acts of terror cannot and should not be legitimised, but the broader call for Palestinian self-determination is something Israel must now meaningfully acknowledge. Its own legitimacy as a democratic, cosmopolitan and secure society is at stake.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

‘From the inside’: Gaza invasion imminent,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-israel-has-green-light-for-ground-invasion-of-gaza/news-story/07b3b07cdac869e337195fdadac9b272,"WARNING: Distressing content US President Joe Biden says Hamas has “unleashed pure unadulterated evil”, as he announced a new request to Congress for military funding for Israel and Ukraine while warning against repeating the mistakes of 9/11. Mr Biden’s comments on Thursday night came as Israel appeared to be on the brink of launching a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, nearly two weeks after Hamas terrorists killed more than 1400 people and captured around 200 hostages in the worst attack in the country’s 75-year history. Tens of thousands of Israeli troops have massed at the border with the tiny parcel of land, which is home to 2.4 million Palestinians. “Anyone who now sees Gaza from a distance will see it from the inside, I promise you,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops at the border on Thursday in a fiery speech. He added there would be “no forgiveness” for the attacks on Israel, “only total annihilation of [the] Hamas organisation — terror infrastructures, everything that has to do with terrorists and whoever sent them”. Read on for the latest news. ‘Majority’ of hostages in Gaza are alive: Israel army Most of the 200 or so people kidnapped in Israel by Hamas militants and taken to the Gaza Strip are still alive, the Israeli military said on Friday. “The majority of the hostages are alive. There were also dead bodies that were taken... to the Gaza Strip,” an army statement said. The military said more than 20 hostages were children, while between 10 and 20 were over the age of 60. There are also between 100 and 200 people considered missing since the Hamas attacks, the army added. On October 7, the Palestinian militant group carried out a deadly assault on Israel, the worst in the country’s 75-year history, killing more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burnt to death on the first day of the raid, according to Israeli officials. Israel has responded with a relentless bombardment that has killed at least 3,785 people in the Gaza Strip, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the territory Gaza war death toll rises to 4,137: Hamas health ministry At least 4,137 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel began bombarding the Palestinian enclave, the Hamas-controlled health ministry said Friday. The ministry said another 13,162 people have been wounded in the Israeli strikes, which have been ongoing since October 7. UN boss arrives at border UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing with Gaza on Friday to oversee preparations for the delivery of aid. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said that the first aid delivery via the Rafah crossing should take place “in the next day or so”. Cargo planes and trucks have been bringing humanitarian aid to Rafah for days, but so far none has been delivered to the Gaza Strip, which Israel has besieged and bombed for 13 days. Rafah is the only crossing into the blockaded Palestinian territory that is not controlled by Israel, which agreed to allow aid to enter after a request from its ally the United States. “We are actively engaging with all the parties, with Egypt, Israel, the United States... in order to have these trucks moving as soon as possible,” Guterres said. It comes as US President Joe Biden faced criticism after pledging 20 trucks of aid, with critics claiming the amount was far too low considering Gaza’s population of over two million. More than 3,700 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli strikes on Gaza, also mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the overcrowded Palestinian territory. Pregnant woman and children killed in airstrike WARNING: Graphic A pregnant Palestinian woman and her two young daughters have been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Rafah, Gaza, near the border with Egypt. The woman, Arij Marwan al-Banna, was seven months pregnant and was killed instantly. Images showed the heartbreaking scene in a hospital room where a doctor gently placed the unborn baby, no larger than his hands, onto Arij’s lifeless body after trying unsuccessfully to save the child. The doctors carefully wrapped the baby’s tiny body in a makeshift white body bag and placed it next to her mother in a black body bag. Arij had moved her family from the north of the Gaza Strip to what was considered a “safe zone” in the southern city of Rafah after Israeli authorities issued evacuation warnings to over a million people. Troops amass near Gaza border Israeli troops and tanks have amassed near the border amid fears of a full-scale ground invasion. Increased military activity was reported in the area with footage showing tanks on the move near Gaza around sunrise local time. It comes after Israel‘s defence chief Yoav Gallant told troops they will soon see Gaza “from the inside.” The minister wished the men luck as he said “there is no forgiveness” for the Hamas‘ horror attack. He told the soldiers: “There is no forgiveness for this thing. Only total annihilation of Hamas organisation, terror infrastructures, everything that has to do with terrorists and whoever sent them. “It will take a week, it will take a month, it will take two months, until we eliminate them. “You are not alone in battle. We trust you and count on you. “Carry on training while there is time, get organised, be prepared, the command will come. Thanks guys, we count on you, good luck. “And anyone who now sees Gaza from a distance will soon see it from inside, I promise you.” UN refugee chief says military escalation ‘catastrophic’ for Gaza Any escalation of military activities in the Gaza Strip will be “catastrophic” for people there, the UN high commissioner for refugees said Friday. “(I) can tell you with certainty that any further escalation or even continuation of military activities will just be catastrophic for the people of Gaza,” Filippo Grandi told reporters in Japan. While stressing that refugee agency UNHCR has no formal mandate in the Palestinian Territories or Israel, Grandi said that he “shares the extreme worry and anguish that has been expressed by many of my colleagues including the UN secretary general” about the conflict. Aid piles up in Egypt Food, medicines, water purifiers, hygiene products and blankets: the aid was piling in Egypt’s Sinai region at El Arish airport, which even opened an extra landing strip to cope with deliveries. Rafah, the border crossing into Gaza that Egypt had promised to open on Friday, is a few dozen kilometres to the east. It is the only crossing into the blockaded Palestinian territory that is not controlled by Israel. On a visit to Cairo, UN chief Antonio Guterres said Thursday that there needed to be “rapid, unimpeded humanitarian access” after dire warnings about the impact of the sustained Israeli blockade. Israel army orders evacuation of northern city after Lebanon clashes The Israeli army announced plans to evacuate the northern city of Kiryat Shmona on Friday, after days of clashes with Hezbollah fighters along the border with Lebanon. “A short while ago, the Northern Command informed the mayor of the city of the decision. The plan will be managed by the local authority, the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Defence,” the military said in a statement. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah and allied Palestinian factions have traded cross-border fire with Israel for days. US troops attacked in Iraq, Syria US troops stationed in Iraq and Syria have been attacked “repeatedly” in recent days, according to a Pentagon spokesperson. Intelligence officials say attacks have ramped up since Israel’s retaliatory strikes on Gaza, but will not yet confirm if there is a link between the two conflicts. Troops stationed just outside Baghdad airport were targeted by rockets on Thursday, after multiple drone strikes were thwarted across both Iraq and Syria. Tension continues to grow in the Middle East as Western nations continue to show support for Israel, sparking fears from analysts across the globe, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani last week condemned Israel and called on world powers to stand up to the “terrible brutality” in Gaza. “While I‘m not going to forecast any potential responses to these attacks, I will say that we will take all necessary actions to defend U.S. and coalition forces against any threat,” Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told reporters on Thursday. “Any response, should one occur, will come at a time in a manner of our choosing.” Middle East teetering on ‘the edge of an abyss’ UN agency chief Philippe Lazzarini has declared the “world is losing its humanity” as conflict escalates in Gaza, warning the Middle East is in its darkest hour. He warned we may be witnessing the calm before the storm of a far greater conflict, should further nations join the conflict that has already claimed over 4,000 Palestinian lives. “The world is now losing its humanity,” Lazzarini, who works with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said on Friday. Speaking in Jerusalem, Lazzarini condemned Hamas‘s attack on Israel, calling it a “horrific and barbaric massacre” that had created a ”national trauma, a collective trauma in Israel”. “But this event still does not justify that the war is conducted without any restraint,” he said. “And I do not believe that killing even more civilians is in the interest of the future security and peace here in the region.” Festival survivor feels unsafe in New York amid protests A US woman who escaped Hamas’ assault on an Israeli music festival earlier this month has admitted she does not feel safe even after returning to New York, claiming “brainwashing” on social media is sparking antisemitism and anti-Israel protests. “A lot of people ask me if I feel safe now that I‘m back in New York. I don’t,” 28-year-old Natalie Sanandaji told Fox News. “A lot of the things I’ve been hearing and seeing since getting back. A lot of the videos of the protests. These pro-Palestinian protests. Something I would like to say about that is, whatever side you’re on in regards to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, all the power to you. “But this is not about Israel-Palestine. This is about Hamas, a terrorist organisation who is just as complicit in the deaths of these innocent Palestinians as they are in the deaths of innocent Israelis.” “The amount of antisemitism I‘ve seen in videos since coming back to New York, antisemitism all over Europe and the United States, that scares me more than anything.” 2.05pm — Ancient church reportedly struck The Hamas-controlled interior ministry said several displaced people who had taken shelter at a church compound in the Gaza Strip have been killed and injured after an Israeli strike late on Thursday. The strike left a “large number of martyrs and injured” at the compound of the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church, the ministry said. Witnesses told AFP the strike appeared to have been aimed at a target close to the place of worship where many Gaza residents had taken refuge as the war raged in the Palestinian enclave. The Israeli army when contacted told AFP it was checking the reported strike. Witnesses said the strike damaged the facade of the church and caused an adjacent building to collapse, adding that many injured people were evacuated to hospital. Saint Porphyrius is the oldest church still in use in Gaza and is located in the city’s historic neighbourhood. The Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem expressed its “strongest condemnation” of the strike at its church compound. “Targeting churches and their institutions, along with the shelters they provide to protect innocent citizens, especially children and women who have lost their homes due to Israeli airstrikes on residential areas over the past 13 days, constitutes a war crime that cannot be ignored,” the Patriarchate said in a statement. 1.10pm — Banker sacked for ‘Hitler’ remark Citibankhas firedone of its staffers after she posted “revolting” commentary on Instagram that endorsed the mass murder of Jewish people during the Holocaust. “No wonder why Hitler wanted to get rid of all of them,” Nozima Husainova wrote with a smiley face emoji in an Instagram story, which has since been deleted along with the 25-year-old’s Instagram and other social media accounts. The post was a screenshot shared to X by non-profit watchdog StopAntisemitism late on Wednesday, which also posted a photo of her Instagram profile that boasted more than 4500 followers. Ms Husainova had written the explosive comment in response to a post about the Gaza hospital bombing that was initially blamed on Israel, but was later revealed to be caused by the Islamic Jihad terror group after its operatives misfired a rocket. The investment bank confirmed to theNY Postthat Ms Husainova was fired after the remark, which was earlier reported on byThe Daily Mail. “We terminated the employment of the person who made the revolting anti-Semitic comment on social media. We condemn anti-Semitism and all hate speech and do not tolerate it in our bank,” a Citi spokesperson said. Critics on social media bashed Ms Husainova’s endorsement of the Holocaust as “vile”, “unbridled anti-Semitism”. Following news of her firing, StopAntisemitism posted to X, “Thank you Citi for saying NO! to anti-Semitism”, while other users expressed gratitude that the bank “did the right thing”. Ms Husainova could not be reached for comment. According to Ms Husainova’s now-deleted LinkedIn page, she graduated from CUNY Brooklyn College in June 2021 with a degree in finance before landing a job as a personal banker at Citi, a role “to foster relations with customers to build loyalty and to help increase sales to individual consumer clients”, according to the bank. According to recruiting site Glassdoor, the average Citi staffer in Ms Husainova’s role takes home just under $US75,000 ($119,000) per year. Ms Husainova had assumed the entry-level position for the Wall Street firm for just two years before being sacked. — NY Post 11am — ‘An inflection point in history’ US President Joe Biden says the world is “facing an inflection point in history”. “One of those moments where the decisions we make today will determine the future for decades to come,” he said in a primetime address from the Oval Office on Thursday night. Mr Biden said Hamas had “unleashed pure unadulterated evil in the world”. “In Israel I saw people who were strong, determined, resilient and also angry, in shock and in deep, deep pain,” he said. “I also spoke with President Abbas [of the] Palestinian Authority, and reiterated the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination, and the actions of Hamas terrorists don’t take that right away.” He added that “as hard as it is, we cannot give up on peace”. “We cannot give up on a two-state solution,” he said. “Israel and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace.” Mr Biden spoke of the need to continue supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia, likening Hamas to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Hamas and Putin share this in common, they both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” he said. The President said on Friday he would be sending an “urgent budget request” to Congress to “fund America’s national security needs to support our critical partners including Israel and Ukraine”. “It’s a smart investment that will pay dividends for Americansecurity for generations,” he said, describing thesecurity package as an “unprecedented addition to our security”. “We’re going to make sure the Iron Dome continues to guard the skies over Israel, we’re going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever and prevent this conflict from spreading,” he said. “In Ukraine, I’m asking Congress to make sure we can continue to send Ukraine the weapons they need to defend themselves and their country without interruption. From the outset, I have said I will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine. All Ukraine is asking for is help. The weapons, munitions, the capacity, the capability to push invading Russian forces off their land. And the air defence systems to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities.” While Mr Biden did not specify how much he was seeking, US media reports suggest he intends to ask Congress for $US60 billion ($95 billion) for Ukraine and $US14 billion ($22 billion) for Israel. Mr Biden also warned of the threat of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism domestically, suggesting many in the Muslim community “are outraged saying to yourself ‘here we go again’ with Islamophobia and distress we saw after 9/11”. “When I was in Israel yesterday, I said that when Americans experienced the hell of 9/11, we felt enraged as well but we sought and got justice and we made mistakes,” Mr Biden said. “So I cautioned the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage. And here in America, let us not forget who we are. We reject all forms of hate. Whether against Muslims, Jews or anyone.” This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

The al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing, has previously boasted of the practice, releasing slickly produced propaganda videos of its weapons squads digging up water pipes, making rockets and firing them indiscriminately into Israel. Hamas says it has launched more than 6000 projectiles at Israel since October 7, ranging from the short-range “Qassam” and “Grad” rockets, to the longer-range M-75 and R-160 rockets, according toThe Week. In 2021, a report by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs noted Hamas had developed enormous capacity to produce its own weapons inside the heavily blockaded Gaza Strip. The think tank said Hamas was “no longer a force fighting an asymmetrical war with asymmetrical tactics and weapons”. “Hamas is now manufacturing a large part of its own weapons, expanding its research, and developing drones and unmanned underwater vehicles, engaging in cyber warfare, and on the cusp of graduating from unguided rockets to precision GPS-guided drones and missiles,” the report said. “They collect unexploded Israeli ordnance for the explosives contained within, recycle streetlight poles or war detritus from the deserted Israeli communities in Gaza for launch tubes, and make projectile tubes from plumbing pipes. The destruction of several hi-rise buildings in May 2021 left much more wiring, pipes, rebar, cement, and metal available for ‘recycling’.” 10.30am — US says 100-300 dead at hospital The US intelligence community has estimated there were likely 100 to 300 people killed in the strike at the Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, according to excerpts of a document seen Thursday by AFP — far fewer than the nearly 500 deaths that health authorities in the Hamas-ruled enclave originally described. An unclassified US intelligence assessment, provided to AFP by a Capitol Hill source, estimates the number of people killed at the hospital Tuesday night at the “low end of the 100-to-300 spectrum”. “We are still assessing the likely casualty figures and our assessment may evolve, but this death toll still reflects a staggering loss of life,” the document said. “The United States takes seriously the deaths of all civilians, and is working intensively to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.” The strike occurred at around 7pm local time on Tuesday, when the health ministry in Gaza said an Israeli air strike had hit the Christian-run Ahli Arab hospital in central Gaza City. Gaza officials have said at least 471 people were killed in the blast, with more than 300 wounded. Hamas has accused an Israeli air strike for the killings, while Israeli army has blamed a misfired rocket from another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad. According to the US intelligence document, “Israel probably did not bomb [the] Gaza Strip hospital” and the United States is continuing “to work to corroborate whether the explosion resulted from a failed PIJ (Palestine Islamic Jihad) rocket”. The document also says there was “only light structural damage at the hospital”, with “no observable damage to the main hospital building and no impact craters”. AFP correspondents at the scene saw dozens of bodies, with medics and civilians recovering bodies wrapped in white cloth, blankets or black plastic bags. Bloodstains and torched cars could be seen in the hospital courtyard. Images of the hospital after the strike published by the Maxar satellite monitoring group show the hospital buildings mainly appeared to be intact. Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus has also disputed the Hamas-run ministry’s figures, asking, “Where are all the bodies?” Hamas has dismissed Israel’s position, saying its “outrageous lies do not deceive anyone”. The United States’ death toll estimate is higher than the 50 people that a senior European intelligence source previously told AFP he believed had been killed. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has said there is “no excuse for hitting a hospital full of civilians” in Gaza, but has not apportioned blame for the blast. 9.50am — Kids ‘tortured’ in front of parents Hamas terrorists tied up families in their homes and tortured young children in front of their parents, according to Israeli first responders. Yossi Landau, a volunteer with Zaka, a group that deals with human remains after terror attacks and natural disasters, has described the unthinkable scenes encountered by first responders after the October 7 massacres across southern Israel that left 1400 dead. In one house, Mr Landau said, the bodies of a father and a mother were found with their hands tied behind their backs. A boy and a girl, aged six or seven, were on the other side of the dining room also with their hands tied behind their backs. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button. Hamas terrorists made the family members watch each other being brutally tortured while eating dinner at the table, Mr Landau told apress conference. “The bodies were tortured,” he said. Mr Landau said to “start using that imagination” on who was “tortured before” — “if this was the children looking at the parents being tortured” or the parents being forced to watch the children. “And when I say tortured, I would say missing body pieces,” he said. “An eye, just taken out, an eye. Fingers being [cut off]. All this happened, and by the end they all had a bullet. In the middle there’s a table. Those terrorists [were] sitting and eating the Saturday meal that was prepared for this family. They ate this meal while torturing these children.” 9.10am — Aussies urged to leave Lebanon The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has urged Australians to leave Lebanon as quickly as possible. DFAT on Thursday updated itstravel adviceto the highest level, “do not travel”, citing the “volatile security situation and the risk of the security situation deteriorating further”. “If you’re in Lebanon and wish to leave, you should depart through the first available commercial option as soon as you’re able to do so,” DFAT said. “Airports may pause operations with little notice due to heightened security concerns. This may cause flight delays or cancellations for a sustained period. The Australian government’s ability to assist you to depart Lebanon will be very limited in a deteriorating security situation.” DFAT warns terrorist attacks “could occur anytime and anywhere, including in Beirut.” 8.25am — Biden to give prime-time address US President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office at 8pm on Thursday (11am AEDT). The speech will cover the US response to the Hamas terror attacks, and also the ongoing war in Ukraine. “We are at a global inflection point that is bigger than party or politics,” Mr Bidenwrote on X. 7.20am — Israel has ‘green light’ for invasion The Israeli military appears to be onthe brinkof launching a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip nearly two weeks after Hamas terrorists invaded southern Israel. The country’s Economy Minister Nir Barkat told ABC News on Thursday that the Israeli Defense Forces has a “green light” to begin an offensive — just in time for the arrival of hefty military arms from the US. “We shall do all efforts to bring our hostages, to bring our hostages [back] alive,” he insisted while acknowledging that the “first and last priority” is destroying Hamas. Hamas has claimed that it is holding about 203 Israeli hostages within the network of tunnels it built underneath Gaza — which Mr Barkat vowed will become the “world’s biggest cemetery”. The IDF is intent on decimating the terrorist group “even if it takes a year” — with hostages and civilian casualties taking a back seat, Mr Barkat explained. Mr Barkat’s announcement came shortly after a US defence official toldThe Wall Street Journalthat the US shipped nearly one million rounds of 7.62mm ammunition and tens of thousands of 30mm rounds to Israel in anticipation of the ground offensive. The generous delivery is part of a previously agreed-upon annual military sale from the US to Israel, the outlet explained. Thus far this year, Israel has also received tens of thousands of 155mm rounds from the US, the report stated. Also on Thursday, the IDF confirmed that it was in the process of approving final plans for a ground invasion of Gaza — which is a 365 square kilometre parcel of land between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea. — NY Post 6.55am — US intercepts missiles from Yemen A US Navy ship on Thursday shot down missiles and drones that had been fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen, possibly at Israel, the Pentagon said. Three “land-attack cruise missiles and several drones” were intercepted by a destroyer, a spokesman told reporters. The attack had been conducted from Yemen and “potentially toward targets in Israel”. The ship, USS Carney, was patrolling in the Red Sea as part of a heavily reinforced US military presence ordered by President Joe Biden to maintain stability in the wake of war between Israel and the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip. The spokesman said that missiles were fired from Yemen where the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels are at war with a government backed by a Saudi-led coalition. According to the spokesman, there were no US casualties and “we cannot say for certain what these missiles were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen, heading north along the Red Sea”. “Our defensive response was one we would have taken for any similar threat in the region,” he said. “We have the capability to defend our broader interests in the region and to deter regional escalation and broader expansion of the conflict that began with Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians.” Mr Biden has ordered increased air and naval assets — including dispatching two aircraft carriers — to the Middle East to guard against the Israel-Hamas war spilling over in the tinderbox region. On Tuesday, the Pentagon also ordered 2000 personnel on standby for potential deployment. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the deployment would allow the United States “to respond more quickly” to the crisis, while the White House stressed it did not intend to put US combat forces on the ground. US media reported the troops being readied for deployment would cover support roles, such as medical assistance and handling explosives. Mr Biden flew to Israel in a dramatic show of US support this week and was due to speak from the White House later Thursday in a speech urging Congress to fund military backing for Israel and another embattled US ally — Ukraine. Asked by journalists late on Wednesday about reports that his administration had told Israel that US forces would fight alongside Israeli troops in response to any attack by the powerful Lebanese movement Hezbollah against Israel, Biden said this was “not true”. However, he said that “our military is talking with their military about what the alternatives are” in the event of a Hezbollah attack. 6.46am — Saudi slams ‘heinous’ Gaza attacks Saudi Arabia’s crown prince said on Thursday that attacks on civilians in Gaza were “heinous” and warned of “dangerous repercussions” should the war between Israel and Hamas expand, state media reported. Mohammed bin Salman, the Gulf kingdom’s de facto ruler, made his comments during a meeting with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who before visiting Riyadh met with Israeli leaders and pressed them to let more humanitarian aid into Gaza. Prince Mohammed “affirmed that the kingdom considers targeting civilians in Gaza a heinous crime and a brutal attack, stressing the necessity of working to provide protection for them”, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. He also “stressed the need to make all possible efforts to reduce the pace of escalation and ensure that the violence does not expand in order to avoid its dangerous repercussions on security and peace in the region and the world”. Hamas militants stormed into Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7 and killed at least 1400 people, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burnt to death, according to Israeli officials. Israel says around 1500 Hamas fighters were killed in clashes before its troops regained control. More than 3700 Palestinians, mainly civilians, have been killed across the Gaza Strip in retaliatory Israeli bombardments, according to figures from its Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Sunak and Prince Mohammed “agreed that the loss of innocent lives in Israel and Gaza over the last two weeks has been horrific”, according to a readout from Mr Sunak’s office. They also “agreed on the pressing need for humanitarian access into Gaza to provide vital water, food and medicine”, it said. Mr Sunak “encouraged the crown prince to use Saudi’s leadership in the region to support stability, both now and in the long term”, it added. Prince Mohammed also spoke by telephone on Thursday with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, SPA reported. In that conversation he advocated for “strengthening international and regional efforts to stop military operations” and urged the UN to provide “safe humanitarian corridors” to get food and medical care into Gaza. Since the war broke out, Saudi Arabia has issued a series of statements denouncing the displacement of Palestinians from their homes and attacks on “defenceless civilians” while affirming its support for the Palestinian cause. The violence has dealt a blow to efforts by US President Joe Biden’s administration to broker a deal that would see Saudi Arabia, guardian of Islam’s holiest sites, recognise Israel. Last week, a source familiar with that process told AFP that Riyadh had decided to “pause discussion on possible normalisation”. 6.36am — Besieged Palestinians await aid Palestinians in war-torn Gaza on Thursday awaited the arrival of emergency aid promised in a deal struck by US President Joe Biden, as Israel’s military kept up its bombardment of targets in the Hamas-run enclave. Cargo planes delivered stocks including food and medicine, water purifiers and hygiene products to Egypt’s El Arish airport, awaiting the opening of the Rafah border crossing to Gaza. Egyptian state-linked broadcaster Al Qahera News said the crossing — the only one into and out of the besieged enclave not controlled by Israel — would open on Friday. On a visit to Cairo, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said there needed to be “rapid, unimpeded humanitarian access” after dire warnings about the impact of the sustained Israeli blockade. “We need food, water, medicine and fuel now. We need it at scale and we need it to be sustained, it is not one small operation that is required,” he added. In Geneva, the emergencies director of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Michael Ryan, said aid needed to get in “every day”, calling the deal struck by Mr Biden with Israel and Egypt to allow in 20 trucks “a drop in the ocean of need right now”. “It shouldn’t be 20 trucks — it should be 2000 trucks,” he said. Entire city blocks have been levelled in Gaza, displacing more than one million of the 2.4 million population, the UN has said. “The pace of death, of suffering, of destruction … cannot be exaggerated,” said UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths. There are fears of worse to come if Israel launches an expected ground invasion to destroy Hamas and rescue more than 200 Israeli and foreign hostages. Mr Biden, on a flying visit to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet on Wednesday, reiterated strong US support for its long-time ally but also stressed the need to address the plight of Palestinian civilians. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Thursday condemned what they said was the “collective punishment” of Gazans. They also warned about the conflict spreading, with anger across the Middle East at Israel and its Western allies. “If the war does not stop [it threatens] to plunge the entire region into catastrophe,” a statement from the Jordanian royal court read. Sisi and Abdullah, whose countries were the first Arab states to make peace with Israel in 1979 and 1994, are seen as key mediators between Israel and the Palestinians. They had been due to have four-way talks with Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas and Mr Biden. But Amman cancelled the summit. Cairo has so far kept the Rafah crossing closed, pointing to repeated Israeli strikes near the checkpoint and voicing fears that Israel may be hoping to permanently drive Palestinians out and into Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. The UN World Food Programme said it has 951 tonnes of food at or on the way to Rafah — enough to feed 488,000 people for one week, a spokesperson said. 6.30am — ‘Maximum 50 killed’ at hospital The Arab world has been united in anger and condemnation of Israel since a blast at a Gaza hospital compound on Tuesday. Israel temporarily recalled its diplomats from Turkey as a security precaution and called on citizens to leave the country as soon as possible. Both sides in the war have traded blame, but neither the provenance of the strike nor the death toll could immediately be independently verified. The strike left scores of bodies and charred cars at the Ahli Arab hospital compound in northern Gaza, AFP images showed. Hamas accused Israel of hitting the hospital during its massive bombing campaign and Gaza’s health ministry put the death toll at 471. Israel blamed a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket — a claim backed by US President Joe Biden — pointing to the lack of a large impact crater typical of its air strikes, and said fuel from the errant rocket exploded. A senior European intelligence source told AFP that he believed a maximum of 50 people were killed. Hamas has dismissed Israel’s position, saying its “outrageous lies do not deceive anyone”, and slammed the United States, accusing it of being complicit in the ongoing strikes on Gaza. 6.24am — Foreigners killed or abducted Scores of foreigners were killed, wounded or taken hostage after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. The worst attack in Israel’s 75-year history killed more than 1400 people, mostly civilians, inside the country, according to Israeli officials. Some 203 people have been confirmed as having been abducted, Israel said on Thursday. Israel has responded with bombardment that has killed at least 3785 people in the Gaza Strip, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in the territory. According to an AFP count, around 200 foreigners have been confirmed dead by their national authorities, many of them also holding Israeli nationality. Among the victims are 31 dead and 13 missing US citizens, 30 dead and 17 Thai hostages, and 28 dead and seven missing French nationals. Also killed or abducted were citizens of Russia, Ukraine, Nepal, Argentina, UK, Canada, Austria, China, Romania, Belarus, Brazil, Philippines, Peru, South Africa, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Germany, Mexico, Netherlands, Paraguay, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. One Australian was killed in the attacks. 4.18am — US issues global travel ‘caution’ The State Department on Thursday issued a rare “worldwide caution” advisory for US citizens everywhere, citing terrorism and potential for anti-American demonstrations. The alert said US citizens should be aware of “increased tensions in various locations around the world”. This includes “potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against US citizens and interests”. The war between Hamas in Gaza and US ally Israel has sent tensions surging in the Middle East. The State Department urged Americans to “stay alert in locations frequented by tourists” and to enrol in a program known as STEP, which allows citizens to be located more quickly in case of emergency. 3am — IDF troops told to ‘get ready’ Israel appears to be on the brink of launching a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, nearly two weeks after Hamas terrorists killed more than 1400 people and captured around 200 hostages. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops at the border on Thursday to “get organised, be ready” to move in, warning of a “lengthy” and “difficult” battle ahead. Tens of thousands of Israeli troops have massed at the border with the tiny parcel of land, which is home to 2.4 million Palestinians. “Anyone who now sees Gaza from a distance will see it from the inside, I promise you,” Mr Gallant said in a fiery speech, adding there would be “no forgiveness” for the attacks on Israel, “only total annihilation of [the] Hamas organisation — terror infrastructures, everything that has to do with terrorists and whoever sent them”. “It will take a week, it will take a month, it will take two months, until we eliminate them,” he said. “You are not alone in battle.” — with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

‘Do not travel’: New warning for Middle East,https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/warnings/dfat-advises-aussies-to-avoid-travelling-to-lebanon/news-story/59d0beb78d1b00dc8143cd667ec3d366,"Australians have been warned to avoid travel to Lebanon as chaos in the Middle East continues to escalate. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued the latest travel advice to its Smart Traveller site on Thursday. “We’ve updated our travel advice for Lebanon and now advise do not travel due to the volatile security situation and the risk of the security situation deteriorating further,” the warning said. “If you’re in Lebanon and wish to leave, you should depart through the first available commercial option as soon as you’re able to do so. “Airports may pause operations with little notice due to heightened security concerns.” The department warns terror attacks could occur “anytime and anywhere, including in Beirut”. Protests have erupted in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, after a rocket blast hit Gaza’s al-Ahli Arab hospital on Wednesday morning. The Israeli Defence Force has produced evidence showing the rocket likely came from a misfire from militant group Islamic Jihad. Hamas, the terrorist group that invaded Israel on October 7, has blamed the rocket blast on Israel. Southern Lebanon shares a border with Israel’s north. Terror group Hezbollah holds power in the southern part of the country and it has lobbed rockets into the Jewish state during earlier periods of confrontation.

‘Abomination’: Bone-chilling Hamas photo,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/horrible-things-unseen-impact-of-israelhamas-war-on-children/news-story/1c46459e99468c1491aec063cf8d6066,"More than a week after Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel, the militant group are reportedly training children for battle. Images and body-cam footage, shared by Israeli Telegram channel South First Responders (SFR), show school-aged boys holding guns and dressed in uniforms, reportedly taking part in “military-style training camps”. SFR said the footage is “evidence of cynical indoctrination of Palestinian children in what appear to be some sort of military-style training camps”. “Footage from these GoPros and other cameras show how Hamas and other terror groups prepared and motivated their forces to carry out massacres against civilians.” The footage was reportedly captured on body-worn cameras taken from dead militants and shared on Telegram last week, though it’s important to note reports from both Hamas and Israel have proven to be unreliable at times. In one image, a group of boys, who appear to be of varying ages, are seen sitting on the ground wearing vests and armed with guns while a number of adults dressed in black stand before them. In another image, a young boy in a camouflage uniform holds a gun in two hands, as a man appearing to adjust a head covering stands behind. SFR also released footage of Hamas killing civilians, with one video showing gunmen going door-to-door searching for people inside, according to theDaily Mail. Holly Cullen, an Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of Western Australia, told news.com.au she was “not surprised” by claims Hamas are allegedly training children. “The participation of children in the Intifada [a Palestinian uprising], mostly in very low level things like throwing stones, has been a long standing feature of the resistance to Israeli occupation. So it’s not surprising that some armed groups will go further.” In 2004, Amnesty International called on Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and al-Aqsa Martyrs’s brigades, to “put an immediate end to the use or involvement of any kind of children in armed activity” following reports a 16-year-old Palestinian child was carrying explosives when attempting to pass through an Israeli army checkpoint. “Using children to carry out or assist in armed attacks of any kind is an abomination. We call on the Palestinian leadership to publicly denounce these practices,” it said in astatementat the time. The recruitment and use of children under the age of 15 as soldiers is prohibited under international humanitarian law and defined as a war crime by the International Criminal Court. Professor Cullen said while children can be forcibly recruited to take up arms, “often children living in places like Palestine, that are in active armed conflict, willingly associate themselves with armed groups”. “Therefore armed groups will take advantage of that and train them and use them.” She predicted children who have been allegedly recruited by Hamas militants – a group which has been reported to have beheaded babies and committed other atrocities – would be exposed to obscene horrors. “Given the level of armed conflict going on, even if they’re civilians, they’re seeing quite a lot of terrible, terrible things. There was a hospital bombed [on Tuesday], so even civilian children are seeing some quite horrible things. “But any child who is involved in armed conflict is seeing whatever their group is doing.” Child soldiers around the world Children have been used as soldiers in more than a dozen countries around the world, including in Uganda where the Lord’s Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony, abducted and deployed 35,000 children. Between 2005 and 2022 alone, over 105,000 children have been recruited and used by parties to conflict, according toUNICEF. As well as combat, Professor Cullen said child recruits, some as young as 10, are used for a number of other purposes, including as cooks, spies, guards and to carry messages between camps. “Sometimes children are able to move more freely between military camps and the civilian population and back. Children may also be more likely to follow orders unquestioningly, and they are often more cooperative, and less likely to question what’s going on.” Once a conflict is over, Professor Cook said there’s a “big effort” by international bodies such as UNICEF to demobilise child soldiers. “They try to reunite them with their families and communities. But then there’s the bigger question of how to give them some kind of rehabilitation.” Even after conflict, children can be left to bear the emotional and psychological burden that comes with witnessing and potentially participating in atrocities. “Children also more vulnerable are more likely to experience forms of post traumatic stress than adults,” said Professor Cullen. “There’s also forms of sexual abuse that happens for both boys and girls … in some African conflicts, there were instances where girls in particular were being assigned as brides to military leaders in armed groups.” Last week, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court reaffirmed the ICC had been investigating “the situation in the State of Palestine” for alleged war crimes committed since June 2014. “This mandate is ongoing and applies to crimes committed in the current context,” the prosecutors said. However, whether the ICC’s probe will include the recruitment or use of child soldiers “depends on the evidence they’re able to compile,” said Professor Cullen. “There are a range of possible crimes against humanity going on at the moment on both sides, and therefore, inevitably, a prosecution has to make choices about what are the most important crimes to prosecute – what are the crimes that they have the best evidence for.” More than 1400 people have been killed in Israel following Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7. In the Gaza Strip, about 3000 people have been killed and 12,500 wounded, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Australia chooses sides on Gaza blast,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/industry-minister-ed-husic-says-palestinians-are-being-collectively-punished/news-story/ef747e267169ce4859c2d88dd956da08,"Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the government did not hold Israel responsible for a hospital explosion in Gaza and confirmed there would be no more repatriation flights for Australians seeking to leave Israel “for the foreseeable future”. Speaking on Thursday, Senator Wong sided with the US and Israeli governments’ claims that Israel was not behind a large blast that killed and wounded a number of Palestinians in a Gaza city hospital. She said her thoughts were with the people who were killed and their loved ones and argued that obeying international humanitarian law was “paramount” “Assessments are difficult, I think it’s appropriate to refer to the US Security Council,” Senator Wong said. “Our current assessment is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion in a hospital in Gaza.” A large-scale blast at the al-Ahli Arab hospital in northern Gaza on Wednesday morning (AEDT) killed at least 500 people, according to Palestinian Ministry of Health Conflicting reports have emerged in the wake of the tragedy, with Hamas pinning the attack an Israeli air strike, and the Israeli military claiming the hit came from a misfired rocket led by Palestinian militants. US President Joe Biden sided with Israel’s account during meeting with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. No more flights: Wong A repatriation flight ferrying more than 50 Australian citizens from Israel that arriving in Sydney on Wednesday night has been confirmed to be the last for “the foreseeable” future, Senator Wong confirmed. The Foreign Minister told the Senate that she had no updates on the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and pressed there were “serious concerns” for Australians living in Lebanon. She that Australia’s official travel advice for Lebanon, as of Thursday, had been updated to “do not travel”. “If you are an Australian in Lebanon you should leave now if it’s safe to do so,” she urged. Earlier, Palestinian ambassador to Australia Izzat Abdulhadi said he would meet with Senator Wong to ask the government to “condemn in the strongest terms the attacks on civilians in Gaza”. “(What’s happening in Gaza) is a huge humanitarian crisis … It’s really catastrophic and a tragedy,” he said. “And here will be huge consequences if the international community does not move quickly to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza.” Dr Abdulhadi said the Australian Palestinian community were “angry and sad” over the Albanese government’s position. “They think that the Australian position is biased to the Israelis,” he said. Earlier, deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley denounced Labor minister Ed Husic’s comments that “Palestinians were being collectively punished” in the war, arguing his stance raised questions about the government’s take on the conflict. Mr Husic, the industry minister, broke cabinet ranks on Thursday after he said Israel’s retaliation against Hamas potentially constituted a breach of international law, which forbids collective punishment. Mr Husic, who is Australia’s first Muslim-Australian minister, condemned the actions of the militant group but also voiced concern over the loss of Palestinian lives. On Thursday, Ms Ley argued Mr Husic’s claims “exposed Labor’s deep division on the question of Israel” and said it “raised serious questions” about the official stance of the Albanese government. “Anthony Albanese must immediately clear up the confusion and explain whether he agrees with his cabinet minister or not,” she said. Ms Ley’s criticisms come a week after she labelled Senator Wong’s call for restraint in Israel and Gaza as “disgraceful”. Seeking to dispel talk of division, Treasurer Jim Chalmers backed Mr Husic, saying the Industry Minister had expressed a view that “we cannot see innocent lives on one side of this worth any more or less than innocent lives on the other side of this”. “We are all making the same point about the need for innocent civilian lives to be respected and protected, consistent with humanitarian law,” he said. “Whether it’s Ed Husic, the Prime Minister … or myself, we are all incredibly concerned about the violence and the bloodshed. We have all condemned the actions of the terrorist group Hamas and we have all expressed our concern for the loss of human life.” Speaking on Thursday morning, Mr Husic said while Israel absolutely had a right to defend itself, he felt “very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively published here for Hamas’ barbarism”, but said there is a higher expectation that innocent lives should be protected during the ongoing conflict. “I really do feel that there is an obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government, to follow the rules of international law and to observe in particular that innocents should be protected,” he told ABC Radio. “I genuinely believe there needs to be a de-escalation. I don’t think it’s in Israel’s interest long term to engage in the occupation of Gaza. “And certainly not in Palestine interests. And I do think that this is a moment where we have to recognise there is a humanitarian catastrophe occurring in Gaza. “We forced basically half the population into the south and Gaza itself, being roughly smaller than the size of Canberra, you just appreciate how difficult this is for innocent Palestinians.” His fellow Muslim ministerial colleague, Anne Aly, said it was “difficult to argue” that the Palestinian people were not being collectively punished but backed the government’s motion that passed the parliament on Wednesday. Ms Aly said it was “entirely appropriate” that the government pass a motion in the parliament to condemn the Hamas attacks. “If you look at the motion which we passed, it does talk about the ongoing conflict,” she told ABC News. “And the Prime Minister and Penny Wong have been very careful to also talk about the loss of civilian lives in Palestine.” Asked if she believed Israel had committed war crimes, Ms Aly said that was something that should be investigated, and if found to have done so, Israel “should be held accountable”. Speaking in support of his parliamentary colleagues, Greens leader Adam Bandt said Mr Husic and Dr Aly were “talking about the reality of what is happening on the ground” and called on the Labor government to “catch up.” “The more that people across this country, including in parliament, see the immense suffering that is happening, the more voices there will be for a ceasefire and a call to end the invasion,” he said. “Because otherwise, these tragedies and the deaths will continue.” Mr Bandt’s comments came after his party unsuccessfully moved a motion in both the House and the Senate to condemn attacks on civilians by Hamas and the Israeli government. Israel has described what happened on October 7 – the day Hamas attacked, slaughtered and kidnapped Israelis – as their September 11. Mr Husic said the number of Palestinians that had been killed so far “equates to the number of people who lost their lives in 9/11” but that fact was going broadly unacknowledged in Australia. “We don’t see any public landmarks in Australia that have been lit up in red, black, white and green,” he said, making reference to the suite of landmarks that were illuminated in the Israeli flag earlier this month. “Now, there’ll be people that are very uncomfortable with me making that remark, but it goes to the heart of what Palestinians and those who care for them in Australia think – which is that Palestinian lives are considered lesser than.” He said Hamas had “absolutely” set back the progress of a two-state solution. “And there are other players in the region who are quite happy to see this happen,” he said. A landmark green energy scheme to keep the lights on as ageing coal fired power generation exits the grid has been unveiled, but the government reveal how much the scheme will cost. Labor has been slammed for being “out of date” on nuclear energy and having an “obsession” with renewables, just days away from a major climate conference in the Middle East. A major change is coming for dual citizens convicted of terrorism with the government vowing to fix “broken” laws.",
"‘Mummy, I’m scared’: Chilling last message",https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/us-president-joe-biden-visits-israel-amid-fallout-from-explosion-at-hospital-in-gaza-strip/news-story/a9532e0b1bdf7e8ffe756852f8847837,"Horrific new footage of the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks has been released by the Israel Defense Forces. It comes after US President Joe Biden visited Israel in a display of solidarity on Wednesday, amid ongoing fallout from an alleged attack on a Gaza hospital which the terror group claimed left up to 500 people dead. Muslim nations and human rights groups have condemned the blast, which Israel and Hamas have blamed on each other. The casualty figure has been disputed by Israel and questioned by open-source intelligence experts. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has now arrived in Israel alongside Biden as efforts continue to de-escalate the conflict. Read on for the latest news. ‘Mummy, I’m scared’: Girl’s heartwrenching last message Galit Dan, whose 12-year-old daughter Noya was kidnapped during Hamas’s assault on October 7, has revealed what the girl said in her final, harrowing phone call. Noya Dan’s family today confirmed that both she and her grandmother Carmella, who was also abducted, had been found dead. “There was a big boom at the door that scared me,” Noya said in her last message. “All the windows in grandma’s house were broken at the entrance. “Because there was another boom, there are many broken windows. “Mummy I’m scared. There are people in the house. Help me.” Noya’s story captured the attention of author J.K. Rowling earlier this week, who shared a photo of the girl in a Harry Potter costume. “Kidnapping children is despicable and wholly unjustifiable,” Rowling said. “For obvious reasons, this picture has hit home with me. May Noya and all hostages taken by Hamas be returned soon, safely, to their families.” Israel’s neighbours condemn ‘collective punishment’ Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II condemned the “collective punishment” of Palestinians in Gaza as they met in Cairo for talks on the Israel-Hamas war. Ahead of the meeting, the Jordanian royal court said Sisi and King Abdullah would “discuss means to stop the Israeli aggression on Gaza”. In separate statements issued later, the Egyptian presidency and the royal court said the two leaders “affirmed their unified position rejecting the policy of collective punishment in the siege, starvation or displacement” of Palestinians. Israel has been carrying out air and artillery strikes on Gaza since Hamas gunmen unleashed a massive attack on communities in southern Israel on October 7 that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people, mainly civilians. The Hamas-controlled health ministry says the Israeli strikes have killed 3,478 people in the besieged Palestinian enclave, also mostly civilians. A siege imposed by Israel has deprived the territory’s 2.4 million people of food, water, electricity and fuel as the United Nations warns of an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. Sisi and King Abdullah warned of regional spillover. “If the war does not stop”, it would threaten “to plunge the entire region into catastrophe”, according to the Jordanian statement. The pair had been due to hold talks with US President Joe Biden and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Jordan this week, but Jordan cancelled the meeting after a deadly strike on a Gaza hospital. Foreign nationals urged to flee Lebanon The US and British embassies in Beirut on Thursday advised citizens to leave Lebanon while flights “remain available” as border tensions between Israel and Hezbollah intensify. Both countries had already warned citizens against travel to Lebanon. “We recommend that US citizens in Lebanon make appropriate arrangements to leave the country; commercial options currently remain available,” a US embassy statement said. A similar warning was issued by the British embassy which said: “If you are currently in Lebanon, we encourage you to leave now while commercial options remain available.” “British nationals should exercise caution and avoid areas where demonstrations may be held,” it added. Hezbollah and allied Palestinian factions have been trading daily cross-border fire with Israel after Hamas launched its massive October 7 assault on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Relentless Israeli strikes on Gaza have since killed at least 3,500 people, mostly civilians, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory. On Tuesday, the US State Department raised its travel advisory for Lebanon from level three to four - the highest level available. It authorised non-essential embassy personnel and their families to leave their embassy citing the unpredictable security situation due to the Israel-Hamas war. Many Arab and Western countries have already encouraged their nationals to avoid travel to Lebanon or leave, with Saudi Arabia on Wednesday urging its citizens to leave Lebanon “immediately” and Kuwait also warning against travelling there. France, Germany, Canada and Australia have also warned against travel to Lebanon, while Spain has advised against non-essential travel. UK PM meets with Netanyahu Benjamin Netanyahu has told UK Prime minister Rishi Sunak Israel was “in its darkest hour”, highlighting that there will be a “long war” ahead. Netanyahu drew particular parallels to World War II, claiming “Hamas are the new Nazis”. “80 years ago the world stood with you during your darkest hour,” he said at a press conference following his meeting with Sunak. “This is our darkest hour - the world‘s darkest hour. “This is why I value your support... We must win together.“That means that this is a long war and we‘ll need your continuous support.” Sunak told Netanyahu that he’s “proud to stand here with you in Israel’s darkest hour, as your friend”. “We will stand with you in solidarity, we will stand with your people. And we also want you to win.” ‘Not enough’: Biden’s aid plan criticised The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has criticised the US response to the crisis in Gaza, insisting President Joe Biden’s pledge of 20 aid trucks to Gaza is “not enough” to support the masses of civilians needing help. “We’re talking about two million people who are in need of everything, so 20 trucks will be a drop in the ocean,” an IFRC spokesperson said. “Obviously, we do welcome any aid entering the country, but we will have to have much more than that.” Aid workers ‘have even run out of body bags’ A spokesperson for the﻿ Egyptian Food Bank has revealed aid workers have been stranded on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border for days awaiting permission to cross. Approximately 120 trucks full of supplies are waiting at the gate with “seven or eight cargo planes loaded with supplies” expected to arrive from Turkey shortly. “We‘re very angry because we know people over there have run out of water, they have even run out of body bags,” Mohsen Sarhan told BBC radio. “We just want the killing to stop for us to be able to get in.” Taylor Swift’s bodyguard returns to Israel to fight The Israeli ministry of foreign affairs has confirmed a bodyguard who worked for Taylor Swift has returned home to “fight for his country”. The ministry shared a photo of the soldier, known only as “Eran” with the pop star alongside a shot of him grinning in military attire. “Hey Taylor Swift, we promise you’ll never find another like him,” the post read. “We love you Eran.” Approximately 360,000 reservists have been called up to the IDF since the Hamas attacks earlier this month, with many being flown across the globe to return to service. Israeli police chief’s warning to protesters Israel’s police chief Kobi Shabtai has warned there will be “zero tolerance for any instance of incitement and no authorisation for protests”. “Whoever wants to become an Israeli citizen, welcome,” Shabtai said. “Anyone who wants to identify with Gaza is welcome. I will put them on the buses heading there now.” Shabtai insisted the hardline stance was because the nation is current “in a state of war”. “We’re not in a situation where we will allow all sorts of people to come and test us,” he said. An Israel Police spokesman Eli Levy told Army Radio that 63 people in Israel have been arrested on suspicion of supporting or inciting “terror” since the latest conflict broke out. China in talks with Egypt Chinese President Xi Jinping told Egypt’s prime minister on Thursday that their countries should work together to bring “more stability” to the Middle East. Xi met Egypt’s Mostafa Madbouli in Beijing on Thursday, repeating China’s support for a “two-state solution... to realise the peaceful coexistence of Palestine and Israel”, according to multiple state media outlets. “China is willing to enhance cooperation with Egypt... and inject more certainty and stability into the region and the world,” Xi was reported as saying. Israel continues relentless bombing overnight Israel intensified its bombing over different parts of the Gaza Strip overnight, with the southern region of Rafah being the most heavily targeted. Dozens more Palestinians have been killed, with 11 residential buildings being reduced to rubble in Khan Younis, Shortly before sunrise five more residential towers were destroyed in al-Zahra in the centre of Gaza. It came as Russia announced it was sending 27 tonnes of humanitarian aid to the region under siege. The US has pledged 20 trucks of aid to Gaza. US official resigns over Israel support A US State Department official has resigned over concerns about the Biden administration‘s handling of the conflict in Israel and Gaza. Josh Paul was the director of congressional and public affairs at the State Department‘s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, which is responsible for arms transfers. His departure marks a rare instance of internal dissent over US support for Israel. He criticised the administration‘s response to the conflict as “an impulsive reaction”, claiming it was a sign of ”intellectual bankruptcy”. “Let‘s absolutely note the horror of what Hamas did, and the scale of it. And therefore I fear the scale of the potential Israeli response or ongoing Israeli response,” Paul said in an interview published by theWashington Post. “I recognise the Israeli government’s right to respond and to defend themselves. I guess I question how many Palestinian children have to die in that process.” “There’s no questioning on this one. There’s no space for substantive dissent within the system on this one. And that’s what led me to my decision.” Paul had worked in his role for more than 11 years, but said he could not continue in a job that he believed was contributing to the deaths of Palestinian civilians. “In my 11 years I have made more moral compromises than I can recall, each heavily, but each with my promise to myself in mind, and intact,” he continued. “I am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued – indeed, expanded and expedited – provision of lethal arms to Israel – I have reached the end of that bargain.” The State Department did not comment on Paul‘s resignation, citing its policy on discussing personnel matters. ‘Learn to shoot straight’, Biden tells Hamas Joe Biden told reporterson Wednesdaythat Palestinian terrorists have “gotta learn how to shoot straight” — one day after an explosion outside a hospital in the Gaza Strip. “I’m not suggesting that Hamas deliberately did it,” the US President said at Ramstein Air Base in Germany en route back to Washington after visiting Israel earlier in the day. “It’s that old thing — gotta learn how to shoot straight,” Mr Biden went on. “It’s not the first time that Hamas has launched something that didn’t function very well.” Hamas, which rules Gaza, claimed on Tuesday that an Israeli air strike killed about 500 people at the hospital — sparking riots across the Middle East and forcing Mr Biden to scrap a planned summit with Arab leaders in Amman, Jordan — but the White House said Wednesday it had determined the explosion was caused by a misfire on the Palestinian side. The Israeli government on Tuesday night blamed the Hamas-allied group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, publishing intercepted phone calls and other evidence to support the claim. “I don’t know all the detail, but I do know the people at the Defense Department who I respect and the intelligence community that I respect, say it is highly improbable that Israel did that,” Mr Biden said on Air Force One. ‘Real credit’: Biden praises Egypt Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has agreed to open the Rafah crossing into Gaza to allow a first batch of around 20 humanitarian aid trucks through, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday. “He agreed to … let up to 20 trucks through to begin with,” Mr Biden told reporters after calling Mr Sisi from Air Force One while returning from a visit to Israel. The shipment would likely not cross until Friday, as the road at the crossing needed repairs, Mr Biden said. “They’re going to patch the road. They have to fill in potholes to get these trucks through. And that’s going to occur — they expect it’ll take about eight hours tomorrow,” he said. The first 20 trucks will be a test of a system for distributing aid without allowing the Palestinian militant organisation Hamas, which controls Gaza, to benefit, the US President said. The United Nations is set to distribute aid on the Gaza side of the border. “If Hamas confiscates it or doesn’t let it get through or just confiscates it, then it’s going to end, because we’re not going to be sending any humanitarian aid to Hamas if they’re going to be confiscating it. That’s the commitment that I’ve made,” Mr Biden said. He added that the 20 trucks represented a “first tranche”, but “150 or something” trucks are waiting in total. Whether the rest are allowed to cross will depend on “how it goes”. Mr Biden had been due to meet Mr Sisi on Wednesday at a four-way summit in Jordan, but it was cancelled after a deadly strike on a Gaza hospital that caused anger across the Arab world. He said he had instead talked to Sisi from Air Force One for about half an hour. “The bottom line is that he deserves some real credit because he was very accommodating,” the US President added. Mr Biden characterised his trip to the war zone as a success and said that while expressing US support for ally Israel, he was “very blunt with the Israelis” on the need to allow aid into Gaza. “If you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain, you should do it. Period. And if you don’t, you’re going to lose credibility worldwide. And I think everyone understands that,” he said. Asked by journalists about reports that his administration had told Israel that US forces would fight alongside Israeli troops in response to any attack by the powerful Lebanese movement Hezbollah against Israel, Mr Biden said this was “not true”. However, he said that “our military is talking with their military about what the alternatives are” in the event of a Hezbollah attack. Bodies of dad, wheelchair-bound daughter found The bodies of an Israeli father and his 16-year-olddisabled daughterwere finally found 12 days after they were slaughtered by Hamas terrorists who attacked a music festival, Israel has confirmed. Erick Peretz and his daughter Ruth — who was wheelchair-bound with cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy — were located by volunteers on Wednesday at the site of the Supernova Sukkot Gathering near the Re’im Kibbutz, where at least 260 Israelis were massacred, according to officials and local reports. They were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists”, Israel wrote on its official X account. “[My father] was really happy, and everything was fine,” his older daughter Yaarit Peretz, 26, told Israeli outlet Ynet on Monday. “For years he goes to these parties and takes Ruth, because it makes her really good and she loves it. There were times when he would take her and she didn’t want to come back.” She was particularly concerned about the survival of her sister Ruth, who needed to be fed through her stomach and other medical care. She is also mostly non-verbal, only able to say a few words, she said. “I find it hard to believe that she will survive in Gaza,” Ms Peretz ominously said at the time. For days, the Peretz family helplessly wondered whether the pair were killed or had been kidnapped. Ms Peretz said she’d heard reports that her father was seen running away with Ruth in his arms but was unable to confirm any information and still had not heard from them. “It’s crazy that so much time has passed and there are still no answers,” she said before finally learning their fate on Wednesday. Posters of kidnapped Israelis in Sydney Posters of Israelis being held hostage by Hamas have been spotted in Bondi, Sydney. The posters, the brainchild ofIsraeli artistsin New York, have been placed in cities around the world. “On October 7th, 2023 nearly 200 innocent civilians were abducted from Israel into the Gaza Strip,” the text reads. “Their whereabouts remain unknown. More than 3000 women, men, and children ranging in age from three months to 85 years old, were wounded, murdered, beaten, raped, and brutally separated from loved ones by Hamas.” Numerous videos on social media have shown pro-Palestinian supporters tearing down the posters. TheHerald Sunreported on Wednesday posters had been ripped down in theMelbourne CBD. Last week a group of womenin Londonwere seen tearing down the posters as one declared “this is for Palestine”. The X account Stop Antisemitism has documented several other similar incidents in the US, involving university students in New York and Pennsylvania and evena dentistin Miami. Egypt announces ‘sustainable’ aid corridor Egypt announced Thursday the ‘sustainable’ passage of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, as hundreds of aid trucks wait at the gates of the enclave being bombarded by Israel. “Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and American President Joe Biden have agreed on the sustainable delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip via the Rafah terminal,” said presidential spokesperson Ahmed Fahmy in a statement, without specifying a date. Horrific new footage of Hamas rampage The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has published a new compilation video showing extremely graphic footage from the Hamas massacres in southern Israel on October 7. The footage “from the eyes of Hamas”, which is too graphic for news.com.au to publish, was recovered from car dashcams, security cameras and cameras worn by the terrorists during the bloody rampage which left more than 1400 people dead. Initial footage shows Hamas terrorists entering Israeli communities, shooting civilians in their cars and on the street as they try to flee and looting corpses. Another dashcam clip shows Hamas members throwing a grenade into a bomb shelter and shooting a man as he tries to run away. In footage recovered from Hamas GoPros and phones, the terrorists are seen invading the towns of Be’eri, Kfar Aza, Sufim and Re’em, going door-to-door and entering homes. In one clip terrorists are seen carrying a body into a car before stealing the man’s baseball cap. The horrific aftermath of the massacres is then shown from the eyes of first responders. “We see homes, including children’s bedrooms, covered in blood; endless rubble; people burned alive in their cars; and a dog shot and disfigured,” the IDF wrote. Biden speaks on Air Force One US President Joe Biden has spoken to reporters on board Air Force One following his visit to Israel. “Virtually every mass shooting, every circumstance where large number of people have been victimised, lost, I spoke with them,” said Mr Biden, accompanied by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “As I learned a long time ago what you all learned in your life as well … when someone’s going through something that is beyond their comprehension … if they see someone who they think understands or maybe [has] been through something not the same but similar, it gives them some sense of hope. “I always get criticised sometimes by my staff because I go to these events I stay for three or four hours to answer all their questions. But it matters, it matters a lot. And look, some of you have gone through a hell of a lot more than I’ve gone through, and a lot more than other people have gone through, and you understand. “So it’s just … people are looking for just something to grab, something that gives them some sense of hope. And if I can do a little bit of that then it’s, you know, it’s worth doing.” Australian unions blame Israel for war Leading members from a lengthy list ofAustralian unionsrepresenting teachers, nurses, construction and maritime workers, public servants and journalists have signed an open letter “in solidarity with Palestine” amid the ongoing conflict. The document, first reported by 2GB’s Ben Fordham,contains signaturesfrom union members representing the likes of the Maritime Union of Australia, National Tertiary Education Union, NSW Teachers Federation, NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association, Australian Services Union, Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, and many others. “In accordance with the union movement’s values of peace, justice and solidarity with working people, we are horrified by the current war between Israel and Hamas and the unspeakable bloodshed and violence it has caused,” it reads. “This tragedy is a direct result of Israel’s blockade and siege of Gaza, and of the apartheid and ethnic cleansing it maintains in the West Bank and within its own borders … In the first instance, we call for an immediate suspension of all hostilities and an immediate end to the blockade of Gaza.” Fordham said on his program, “Interestingly, the union members chose not to condemn the horrific terror attack by Hamas. There was no show of strength when hundreds of Jews were slaughtered by a terror organisation. Instead they’ve waited until now to take a stance. And it comes at a time when Hamas is holding babies as hostages.” Sunak to visit Israel on Thursday British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will travel to Israel on Thursday before heading to other countries in the region in an effort to de-escalate the Israel-Gaza conflict, his office has said. “The attack on al-Ahli Hospital should be a watershed moment for leaders in the region and across the world to come together to avoid further dangerous escalation of conflict,” Mr Sunak said in a statement. “I will ensure the UK is at the forefront of this effort.” Mr Sunak will stress the international community must “not let Hamas’ barbaric terrorism and disregard for human life become a catalyst for further escalation of conflict in the region”, the statement said. Expected in Israel early on Thursday morning, Sunak is due to meet his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog. He is also expected to insist that humanitarian aid, which London recently announced would be increased for the Palestinians, be allowed to arrive at a time when Israel has authorised the entry of aid into Gaza from Egypt, and that Britons stranded in Gaza be allowed to leave. Alongside the British PM’s trip, his Foreign Secretary James Cleverly is due to visit Egypt, Turkey and Qatar “in the coming days”, according to Downing Street. London has pledged its support for Israel following the bloody attacks by Hamas, which killed more than 1400 people, and has announced that the UK’s humanitarian aid to the Palestinians will be increased by a third — an extra £10 million ($19 million). ‘Is it from us?’: IDF releases ‘terrorists’ audio The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released an audio recording on Wednesday of what it claims are two Islamic Jihad terrorists admitting responsibility for the Gaza hospital blast. The clip,posted on X, is captioned “Islamic Jihad struck a Hospital in Gaza — the IDF did not. Listen to the terrorists as they realise this themselves.” This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button. “Is it from us?” one operative is heard asking on the recording, according to the IDF’s translation. “It looks like it,” his cohort replies. The purported members of Islamic Jihad — an arm of the ruling militant group Hamas — are then heard acknowledging that the shrapnel of the missile “are local pieces, and not Israeli shrapnel”, from rockets fired from the “cemetery behind the hospital.” “But God bless, it couldn’t have found another place to explode?” one of them asked. The IDF’s audio post was met with widespread scepticism on X, as many users questioned the veracity of the high-quality recording and wondered why the military was now able to surveil Hamas operatives but was caught off guard by the group’s heinous and long-planned October 7 surprise attack across the disputed border that killed more than 1400. ‘Wouldn’t trust’ Hamas figures Former British army commander Richard Camp has weighed in on the hospital blast, tellingThe Sunhe found Israel’s evidence “pretty compelling” and he “wouldn’t trust” casualty figures produced by the Hamas terror group. “In my experience, the IDF does not deny doing something of this sort if they do do it,”he said. “There have been incidents in the past, where they’ve accidentally caused large numbers of civilian casualties, and in each case, when that’s happened they have admitted and explained why it happened. In my opinion there’s no doubt that the IDF did not carry out this attack.” He added, “I wouldn’t trust the casualty figures produced the Hamas. The Gaza medical authorities are controlled by Hamas, and the figures they produce, very often are false, very often exaggerated. They very often attribute to the IDF casualties that have been [caused] by their own people.” New pics cast doubt on ‘500 dead’ claim New images have cast doubt on Hamas’ claims that a blast which it blamed on an Israeli air strike left up to “500 people” dead at a Gaza hospital. Gaza’s Health Ministry claimed that a fiery explosion rocked the al-Ahli Arab Hospital at around 7pm local time on Tuesday evening, killing 471 people. The news sparked outrage in neighbouring Muslim countries and widespread protests. Israel and the US both claim intelligence proves the blast was caused by a misfiring rocket from Gaza. Israel also questioned the legitimacy of the original death toll claimed by Hamas. Now photos andsatellite imagestaken in the light of day appear to show minimal damage to the hospital itself. Images of the car park blast site show around a dozen burnt-out cars in a small area. “Now that day has broken, and we’re getting better evidence, I’m willing to share some preliminary thoughts on the al-Ahli hospital explosion,”Nathan Ruser, an analyst specialising in satellite imagery at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), wrote on X. “The photos of the scene are, to me, not consistent with an air strike and are not consistent with claims that 500+ people were killed. Photos of the aftermath show that the vast majority of the damage is from fire. Only three cars show any clear sign of kinetic/structural damage. And for two of them, the general structure remains intact — despite clear damage. Indeed, within 10 metres of the impact site there are cars which appear mostly undamaged.” Mr Ruser noted that the positioning of the cars was consistent with drone footage released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) shortly after the explosion. He said the claimed casualty count of 500 people “seems widely inconsistent with the damage we can see”. “I am not doubting that civilians were killed, videos show the bodies collected in the hospital courtyard and I have no reason to doubt that,” he said. “But 500’s [an] incredibly high number, honestly implausible. Overlaying the area of damage on Google Earth — keep in mind this is mostly from burning cars NOT the explosion — it is 228 square metres.” Mr Ruser stressed that “none of this absolves the IDF from the countless civilians it has killed in this aerial campaign”, but added it “seems extremely clear to me, that much … of the initial reporting and discussion surrounding this explosion was inaccurate”. “It has also put me in the unenviable position of not being able to fully trust the numbers that come out of the Gazan Health Ministry, considering they are the only source providing numerical figures of the unquestionably numerous casualties in Gaza,” he said. An investigation by the BBC’s fact checking unitBBC Verifyalso raised questions about the initial claims. “Based on available evidence, it appears the explosion happened in a courtyard which is part of the hospital site,” the BBC said. “Images of the ground after the blast do not show significant damage to surrounding hospital buildings. What the images do show are scorch marks and burnt-out cars.” A representative from the Anglican Church, which owns and runs the hospital, told the BBC that about 1000 displaced people were sheltering in the courtyard when it was hit and about 600 patients and staff were inside the building. “Because of lack of access to the site for independent organisations, it is difficult to verify the number killed,” the BBC said. It comes after US President Joe Biden told Israeli officials on a visit to Tel Aviv that based on intelligence he had seen the explosion was “done by the other team, not you”. US officials later bolstered his statements by revealing they had collected “high confidence” intelligence signals that Islamic Jihad was behind the explosion,The Wall Street Journalreports. “Our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza,” said White House National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson. ‘Done by the other team’: Biden US President Joe Biden has backed his ally’s stance blaming Palestinian militants for a rocket strike on a hospital that allegedly killed hundreds in war-torn Gaza. Multiple countries blamed Israel, which has rained bombs on Gaza since the bloody October 7 attack by Hamas, and protests erupted in Muslim countries from Egypt to Pakistan while Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah vowed a “day of rage”. But Mr Biden, on a solidarity visit to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, voiced support for Israel’s position that a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket caused the deadly carnage at Gaza’s Christian-run Ahli Arab Hospital. “I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” Mr Biden said about the strike that killed 471 people, according to Gaza’s Hamas-controlled health ministry. “And, based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,” said the US President, referring to the armed movements Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which Washington designates “terrorist” groups. “But there’s a lot of people out there not sure, so we have to overcome a lot of things.” Asked later by reporters what made him sure that Israel was not responsible for the strike, Mr Biden replied, “The data I was shown by my Defense Department.” Mr Biden expressed “iron-clad” US support for Israel and its military campaign. “We will continue to have your back,” he said after meeting Mr Netanyahu’s war cabinet in Tel Aviv. “As you work to defend your people, we will continue to work with you and partners across the region to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians.” Biden lands in Israel US President Joe Biden has landed in Israel, where he was welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. His visit came after a blame game erupted between Hama sand Israel over the explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip. ‘We will not kneel’: Abbas Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has cut short his trip to Jordan in the wake of last night’s hospital blast that allegedly claimed the lives of 500 people in Gaza. The leader under siege has vowed Palestine “will not surrender, and will prevail”, refusing to let the current situation devolve into another generational catastrophe for the sovereignty of the embattled nation. He described the situation on the ground as a “hideous war massacre”. “In light of this calamity that occurred tonight, and out of concern for our people, I decided to cut short my visit and return to the homeland to be among my people in this great ordeal, and I agreed with the brothers in Jordan and Egypt to cancel the summit that was scheduled today in Amman with President Biden,” Mr Abbas said. “We will not allow a new Nakba in the 21st century, and we will not accept the displacement of our people again. Our people will remain steadfast in their homeland and will not leave, no matter the sacrifices. “We will do everything necessary to stop the bloodbath in Gaza and in the West Bank. We will not accept anything other than stopping this war, and the Security Council must shoulder its responsibilities and take the initiative to issue a resolution to condemn this crime and stop the aggression immediately. “Our people will not kneel, will not surrender, and will prevail.” Biden to pose ‘tough questions’ We are awaiting the moment US President Joe Biden arrives in Israel, where he will pose “tough questions” to government officials as the situation continues to deteriorate. Mr Biden has now had his trip to Jordan cancelled as the war in Gaza continues. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told Al Jazeera the Amman summit was cancelled as “there is no use in talking now about anything except stopping the war”. UN calls for ‘immediate ceasefire’ Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres has called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in Gaza following the hospital blast. Mr Guterres was speaking at a Beijing forum attended by both Chinese President Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin and stressed that the “entire region” hangs in the balance. His comments followed a threat from Iran to intervene and attack Israel before the IDF could continue its plan to wipe Hamas from Gaza. “I call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire … to ease the epic human suffering we are witnessing,” he said. “Too many lives, and the fate of the entire region hang in the balance.” Gaza’s Health Ministry said the scene on the ground was “unparalleled and indescribable”. “Doctors are performing surgeries on the ground and in the corridors, and some of them were without anaesthesia,” ministry spokesman Dr Ashraf Al-Qudra said in a statement following the alleged attack. “A lot of people are still waiting for operations, and the medical teams are trying to save their lives in intensive care.” Horrifying scenes at site of hospital blast Palestinian authorities claim 500 people are feared dead after the blast at al-Ahli Arab Hospital. Zaher Sahloul from the US-based MedGlobal humanitarian organisation called it “the worst attack on a medical facility in the 21st century”. “Bombing hospitals is against international law,” he said. “It is a war crime. It compounds trauma in the Gaza Strip, sending the message that nowhere is safe, not even inside a hospital.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) demanded the immediate protection of civilians and health care in the Gaza Strip. “WHO strongly condemns the attack on al-Ahli Arab Hospital,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X. Tamara al-Rifai, from the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), claimed there was “direct Israeli fire” on the hospital. “An attack on densely populated refugee camps where people are sheltering in UN schools and premises is something that is utterly shocking,” she told Al Jazeera. “It is a very sad violation of international humanitarian law. I am lost for words right now.” The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was “shocked and horrified” by the blast. “Hospitals should be sanctuaries to preserve human life, not scenes of death and destruction,” it said in a statement. “No patient should be killed in a hospital bed. No doctors should lose their lives while trying to save others. Hospitals must be protected under international humanitarian law.” Israel slams hospital ‘blood libel’ Israel’s Foreign Ministry claims it has vision that proves Hamas rockets were responsible for the blast at the hospital. “From the analysis of the operational systems of the IDF, an enemy rocket barrage was carried out towards Israel, which passed through the vicinity of the hospital when it was hit,” a post from Israel’s official account on X reads. “According to intelligence information, from several sources we have, the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation is responsible for the failed shooting that hit the hospital.” It said that “the IDF did not conduct any operations in the area at the time of impact”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a furious statement shortly after the blast. “So the whole world knows: The barbaric terrorists in Gaza are the ones who attacked the Gaza hospital, not the IDF,” Mr Netanyahu said. “Those who cruelly murdered our children, murder their children as well.” And Israeli President Isaac Herzog has slammed allegations it launched an air strike on the hospital. “An Islamic Jihad missile has killed many Palestinians at a Gazan hospital — a place where lives should be saved,” Mr Herzog said in a post on X. “Shame on the media who swallow the lies of Hamas and Islamic Jihad — broadcasting a 21st-Century blood libel around the globe. Shame on the vile terrorists in Gaza who wilfully spill the blood of the innocent. Never before has the choice been clearer. Israel is standing against an enemy made of pure evil. If you stand for humanity — for the value of all human life — you stand with Israel.” Fiery protests break out Thousands of angry protesters have stormed part of the US Embassy in Lebanon, tearing down an American flag and replacing it with a Palestinian one. The streets of Beirut have been filled with demonstrators, who began gathering late on Tuesday night local time following the deadly blast at a Gaza hospital. Another crowd gathered outside the French Embassy nearby. Police shot off smoke bombs in an attempt to disperse demonstrators. Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, called for mass protests in response to the hospital blast. At the same time, hundreds of Palestinians took to the streets across West Bank cities, including Ramallah. Footage shows demonstrators clashing with authorities, with security forces firing tear gas on the crowd. The AFP news agency says people in the crowd were demanding Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas resign over his handling of the conflict with Israel. Similar protests against the hospital attack are being staged in Tunisia, Jordan, Turkey, Syria, Morocco, Yemen and Lebanon. — with AFP and NY Post Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Australia takes new action against Iran,https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/sanctions-travel-bans-imposed-on-iran-over-its-nuclear-and-missile-programs/news-story/bf96d8755a91cb28a5cdf50aefc320b1,"Three new Iranian individuals and 11 entities have been slapped with targeted financial sanctions and travel bans over their role in the Middle Eastern country’s nuclear and missile programs. Penalties have also been reimposed on the 19 Iranian individuals and entities, in actions mirroring international partners like the European Union, Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced. The sanctions were originally imposed under the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2231 to ensure Iran would dismantle its nuclear arms programs via the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under the terms, Iran would have to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify its progress. While Iran doesn’t have any known nuclear weapons, the IAEA states the republic has 18 nuclear facilities and nine locations outside facilities under IAEA safeguards. Senator Wong called on the Iran to “cease its escalatory actions in its nuclear program and recommit to full compliance with its nuclear-related commitments”. “Iran’s proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles raises tensions in an already volatile region,” the statement said. “This includes reversing all steps away from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and allowing the International Atomic Energy Agency to completely verify Iran’s peaceful use of nuclear technology. “These sanctions demonstrate Australia’s commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and determination to work with our international partners.” The sanctions come as tensions continue to escalate between Israel and Gaza, Iran has rattled the international community with threats to enter the conflict through its state-backed militant group Hezbollah. “All possible options and scenarios are there for Hezbollah,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state TV on Monday. “Naturally, resistance leaders will not allow the Zionist regime to take any action in Gaza, and when it feels reassured about Gaza, move on to other resistance areas in the region.” “Therefore, any pre-emptive measure is imaginable in the coming hours.” To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout “Risky behaviours” by China towards Australia could be pointing to a dangerous escalation which could blow up any moment.

US President Joe Biden has landed in Israel to prevent the war with Hamas from escalating into a broader Middle East conflict. Biden was welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv. A blame game erupted between Hamas and Israel, with Hamas claiming it was an Israeli airstrike while the IDF accused Islamic Jihad militants for a misfired rocket. The hospital explosion has sparked global anger, with the Iranian embassy in Syria on Wednesday stating “the time is up” for Israel, while Tehran-backed terror group Hezbollah called for a “day of rage”. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Israeli officials “should be tried for their crimes” committed against Palestinians in Gaza.

Guterres was speaking at a Beijing forum attended by both Chinese President Xi and Rusisan President Putin and stressed that the “entire region” hangs in the balance. His comments followed a threat from Iran to intervene and attack Israel before the IDF could continue its plan to wipe Hamas from Gaza. “I call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire... to ease the epic human suffering we are witnessing,” he said, ”Too many lives, and the fate of the entire region hang in the balance.” The Palestinian health ministry said the scene on the ground is “unparalleled and indescribable”. “Doctors are performing surgeries on the ground and in the corridors, and some of them were without anesthesia,” ministry spokesman Dr Ashraf Al-Qudra said in a statement following the alleged attack. “A lot of people are still waiting for operations, and the medical teams are trying to save their lives in intensive care.” Vision ‘proves’ rockets originated in Gaza Several video clips have been released appearing to show a barrage of rockets originated in Gaza headed for targets in Israel, moments before a deadly blast at a hospital that has killed 500 people. Scores of civilians had been seeking shelter and medical care at al-Ahli Arab Hospital, which was struck overnight in an air raid that witnesses claim was carried out by Israeli forces. Images are emerging of the horrifying scenes at the hospital, with hundreds of victims still trapped beneath rubble. Vision, which has not been independently verified, is circulating online that Israelis say “proves” the blast was caused by a failed rocket strike launched from within Palestine. In one, CCTV footage is said to show the moment a rocket fired from within the Gaza Strip fell short and exploded in Palestine. That vision appears to match similar footage shot and broadcast by the television outlet Al Jazeera, which also shows a rocket misfire landing in Gaza. And another clip shared online by Palestinian media outlets also reportedly depicts the moment of the blast at the hospital. Jordan Schachtel, an Israeli journalist for the outlet Dossier Today, took to X to share a screenshot of Telegram messages he claims indicate Hamas militants are to blame. Hamas has rejected the claims and insisted the blast was an air strike launched by Israel, calling it “a war crime”. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned the “cold-blooded massacre”. It will “forever remain a stain on the conscience of humanity that has been witnessing the horrors committed against the Palestinian people without taking action to stop it”, a statement read. US President Joe Biden said in a statement he is “outraged and deeply saddened” by the bloodshed and indicated America will conduct its own analysis of who is responsible. Mr Biden said he had “directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened”.

Similar protests against the hospital attack are being staged in Tunisia, Jordan, Türkiye, Syria, Morocco, Yemen and Lebanon. Biden’s trip falls apart US President Joe Biden has taken off from Andrews Air Force Base in Air Force One, headed to Israel for high-level talks. Mr Biden was due to then travel on to Jordan for a summit with Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, but he has pulled out. Mr Biden and Mr Abbas were due to meet in Oman, alongside Jordanian represents and a delegation from Egypt. But the president may skip the Jordan part of his visit entirely after the kingdom also pulled out of plans to meet with Mr Biden, and Egypt refused to attend. News of the cancelled meeting came on the back of Hamas blaming America for the bloodshed at the hospital. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a televised address that the US was to blame because it has given Israel “cover for its aggression”. Speaking after the horrific attack, which has killed 500 people, Haniyeh called on Palestinians to “get out and confront the occupation and the settlers”. “The hospital massacre confirms the enemy‘s brutality and the extent of his feeling of defeat,” he said. He added that the attack will be “a new turning point”. Haniyeh called for Arabs and Muslims across the world to stage protests against Israel. World reacts to hospital horror The White House has issued a statement, which reads: “The President sent his deepest condolences for the innocent lives lost in the hospital explosion in Gaza, and wished a speeding recovery to the wounded.” Russia and the United Arab Emirates have demanded an urgent session of the United Nations Security Council in response to the blast at a hospital in Gaza. The request came shortly after Jordan’s King Abdullah described the situation as a “massacre” and blamed Israel for the attack. King Abdullah called for Israel to immediately end its war against Hamas, which has caused the suffering of Palestinians that is a “shame on humanity”. In the United Kingdom, Labour leader Keir Starmer said scenes at the hospital are “absolutely devastating and cannot be justified”. Mr Starmer took to X, formerly Twitter, to say: “International law must be upheld.” In Scotland, First Minister Humza Yousaf said the blast must be “unequivocally condemned in the strongest possible manner”. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the attack is “horrific and completely unacceptable”. Mr Yousaf, who has family in Gaza, added: “There can be no justification for this. None whatsoever.” Saudi Arabia has also condemned the “heinous crime”. Aussies remain stuck in Gaza Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neill has confirmed there are 46 Australian citizens in Gaza. “I can’t give you the demographic information of who it is, all I know is that there are 46 Aussies with Australian passports in their hands,” Ms O’Neill told Channel 7’s Sunrise. The government has helped some 1500 people to flee the region, she added. “We’ve got to now focus our attention on those 46 people, and we’re doing everything we can. We hope that we’ll be able to report back something positive.” Aid still unable to enter Gaza A long queue of trucks packed with vital remains blocked at the Egypt border with Gaza, with a crossing between the cities of El-Arish and Rafah still closed. But there’s growing hope that humanitarian aid could begin flowing into the war-ravaged region today. “Until now, there is no safe passage that has been granted,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said. In an interview with CNN, Mr Shoukry also confirmed the border crossing at Rafah had been bombed four times in recent days. “The crossing has sustained damage, the roads, access roads between the Egyptian and Gaza side have severe damage and need repair,” he said. US to continue “steady flow of weapons” US to continue “steady flow of weapons” The Pentagon will continue to provide a “steady flow of weapons” to Israel, which have so far occurred “near daily”. Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed five C-17 aircraft missions have successfully carried out a range of security assistance missions since last Tuesday.“You’re seeing near daily deliveries into Israel and I would expect that those are going to continue to flow,” Ms Singh said. In addition to providing arsenal, the US is boosting its presence in the Middle East as both a sign of support and strength. It’s hoped the arrival of warships and the prepared deployment of 2000 marines will deter the involvement of Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the conflict. Last text from hostage revealed The mother of French-Israeli woman Mia Shem, held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza, has revealed a panicked text message the 21-year-old sent to a friend as militants attacked the festival she was attending. “They’re shooting at us,” Mia wrote in the text. “Please, come save us!” Her mother, Keren Schem, addressed a press conference in Israel on Tuesday, local time, a day after Hamas released footage of Mia in captivity – alive, but injured. “I ask world leaders that my daughter be returned to us in the state that she is today, as well as the other hostages,” Ms Shem said at a press conference in Tel Aviv. She was speaking a day after Hamas broadcast a video showing her daughter receiving treatment for a wounded arm. “I beg the world to return my baby to me,” Ms Shem said, after French President Emmanuel Macron demanded her immediate and unconditional release. Ms Shem said her daughter was at a rave party in the desert near the border when she was abducted to Gaza during the deadly attack Hamas militants launched on Israel on October 7. “Now she is in Gaza. She is not the only one. There are many adults, children, babies and Holocaust survivors,” she said of other Israelis and foreigners held by militants. “It is a crime against humanity. All together we need to stop this terror.” Ms Shem said she had not known whether her daughter “was alive or dead” until Hamas released the video footage of her. “There was a rumour saying that she was wounded in the shoulder or the leg. She was wounded in the hand. She was operated on,” Ms Shem said. “She looks terrified. She says what they tell her to say. I’m really worried about her.” Top Hamas commander killed Ayman Nofal, a member of Hamas’s military council, has been killed in an Israeli air strike. “Air Force fighter jets, under joint intelligence guidance with the Shin Bet, killed one of the senior members of the Hamas terrorist organisation, Ayman Nofal, who served as the commander of the Hamas central camps brigade in the Gaza Strip, and as the former head of Hamas’s military intelligence,” the Israeli military said on Tuesday, local time. “By virtue of his duties, he directed many terrorist attacks against Israel and the security forces, and he directed the targets of Hamas’ rocket fire, specifically targeting areas populated by uninvolved civilians. “In the past, he was involved in the production and development of weapons, promoted and was a partner in many terrorist attacks, and was even a partner in planning the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit.” Hamas has confirmed Nofal’s death, according to Reuters. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
‘Time is up’: Terror fear as Biden lands,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/war-crime-hundreds-killed-after-air-strike-flattens-gaza-hospital-with-israel-and-hamas-blaming-each-other/news-story/07e5ef6a1ca5ec1b3adb33163b6f75fe,"Human rights groups and world leaders have condemned an air strike on a hospital in the Gaza Strip, which has killed at least 500 civilians and injured scores more. Both Hamas and the Israeli Defence Force blame the other for the deadly carnage. US President Joe Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday, local time, in a trip that has been thrown into chaos with Palestine pulling out of a summit in Jordan. Read on for the latest news from the conflict. Biden on hospital bombing Joe Biden has told Israel’s prime minister that it “appears” the hospital bombing overnight was ”done by the other team”. The US President said he was “deeply saddened and outraged” by the horrific tragedy. “Based on what I‘ve seen it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you. But there’s a lot of people out there who are not sure, so we’ve got to overcome a lot of things,” he said. Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila said the death toll in Gaza has now risen to 3,300 with a further 13,000 injured. The world continues to react to the situation unfolding on the ground. China’s foreign ministry joined several other nations in condemning the violence on Wednesday. “China is shocked by and strongly condemns the heavy casualties caused by the attack on a Gaza hospital,” the statement read. “China calls for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the war.” UNICEF has also called for peace, warning leaders there is “no place that is safe in Gaza for children and families right now”. “We have delivered all we can in the past 10 days; what’s needed now is a halt in the hostilities, a humanitarian corridor and guarantees for the safe delivery of supplies,” a UNICEF spokesperson said. ‘Time is up’: Terror fear as Biden lands US President Joe Biden has landed in Israel to prevent the war with Hamas from escalating into a broader Middle East conflict. Biden was welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv. A blame game erupted between Hamas and Israel, with Hamas claiming it was an Israeli airstrike while the IDF accused Islamic Jihad militants for a misfired rocket. The hospital explosion has sparked global anger, with the Iranian embassy in Syria on Wednesday stating “the time is up” for Israel, while Tehran-backed terror group Hezbollah called for a “day of rage”. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Israeli officials “should be tried for their crimes” committed against Palestinians in Gaza. Palestine President: ‘We will not kneel’ Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has cut short his trip to Jordan in the wake of last night’s hospital bombing that claimed the lives of at least 500 people in Gaza. The leader under siege has vowed Palestine “will not surrender, and will prevail”, refusing to let the current situation devolve into another generational catastrophe for the sovereignty of the embattled nation. He described the situation on the ground as a “hideous war massacre”. “In light of this calamity that occurred tonight, and out of concern for our people, I decided to cut short my visit and return to the homeland to be among my people in this great ordeal, and I agreed with the brothers in Jordan and Egypt to cancel the summit that was scheduled today in Amman with President Biden,” Abbas said. “We will not allow a new Nakba in the 21st century, and we will not accept the displacement of our people again. Our people will remain steadfast in their homeland and will not leave, no matter the sacrifices. “We will do everything necessary to stop the bloodbath in Gaza and in the West Bank. We will not accept anything other than stopping this war, and the Security Council must shoulder its responsibilities and take the initiative to issue a resolution to condemn this crime and stop the aggression immediately. “Our people will not kneel, will not surrender, and will prevail.” ‘Indescribable’: UN calls for ‘immediate humanitarian ceasefire’ Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres has called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in Gaza following last night’s devastating hospital bombing. Guterres was speaking at a Beijing forum attended by both Chinese President Xi and Rusisan President Putin and stressed that the “entire region” hangs in the balance. His comments followed a threat from Iran to intervene and attack Israel before the IDF could continue its plan to wipe Hamas from Gaza. “I call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire... to ease the epic human suffering we are witnessing,” he said, ”Too many lives, and the fate of the entire region hang in the balance.” The Palestinian health ministry said the scene on the ground is “unparalleled and indescribable”. “Doctors are performing surgeries on the ground and in the corridors, and some of them were without anesthesia,” ministry spokesman Dr Ashraf Al-Qudra said in a statement following the alleged attack. “A lot of people are still waiting for operations, and the medical teams are trying to save their lives in intensive care.” ‘It wasn’t Israel’: Defence expert’s verdict An Australian defence expert said there is “very little evidence” Israel is responsible for a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of civilians. Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst in defence strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the most likely culprit is the terror group Islamic Jihad, which supports Hamas. Scores of civilians had been seeking shelter and medical care at al-Ahli Arab Hospital when it was struck with a rocket. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button. “Israelis are not going to make a horrendous mistake like attacking a hospital for civilians right at the point when it‘s in their strategic interest to ensure as much of backing as possible,” Mr Davis told ABC News 24. “You can see the consequences of this action if the Israelis had done this, it would have been an incredible own goal of sorts to essentially kill large numbers of civilians deliberately. “The Israelis don‘t do that. Yes, civilians are being killed in these air strikes but primarily because Hamas is refusing to let [civilians] withdraw. So, I don’t believe the claims were coming out of Hamas that the Israeli’s were behind this.” Videos that have emerged today in the wake of the attack appear to show rockets “being launched from Gaza and then misfiring, then coming back down in a civilian area,” Mr David added. “It suggests either it was a faulty rocket of that [Islamic Jihad] made an error when they launched it.” Israel to release dossier Israel’s Defence Force claims its radars showed “outgoing rocket fire” at the same time as a blast at a Gaza hospital, which killed hundreds. A spokesperson also claimed Israel intercepted radio communications between Islamic Jihad terrorist group members indicating it had fired the rockets. Israel has confirmed there were no forces active in the area at the time of the attack, the spokesperson added. Aerial drone footage, which has not been released, also shows an explosion that is “inconsistent” with Israeli weaponry. A dossier of “evidence” will be prepared and presented to US President Joe Biden when he arrives in Tel Aviv later today. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button. ‘Lies’: Israel’s claim attacked Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad has responded to Israel’s allegation that it’s to blame for the blast. “The Zionist enemy is trying hard to evade its responsibility for the brutal massacre he committed by bombing the Baptist Arab National Hospital in Gaza through his usual fabrication of lies, and through pointing the finger of blame at the Islamic Jihad movement in Palestine,” it said in a statement. “We therefore affirm that the accusations put forward by the enemy are false and baseless.” The group added that the hospital had been ordered to evacuate before the blast and claimed a bomb was dropped by an Israeli Defence Force plane. Vision ‘proves’ rockets originated in Gaza Several video clips have been released appearing to show a barrage of rockets originated in Gaza headed for targets in Israel, moments before a deadly blast at a hospital that has killed 500 people. Scores of civilians had been seeking shelter and medical care at al-Ahli Arab Hospital, which was struck overnight in an air raid that witnesses claim was carried out by Israeli forces. Images are emerging of the horrifying scenes at the hospital, with hundreds of victims still trapped beneath rubble. Vision, which has not been independently verified, is circulating online that Israelis say “proves” the blast was caused by a failed rocket strike launched from within Palestine. In one, CCTV footage is said to show the moment a rocket fired from within the Gaza Strip fell short and exploded in Palestine. That vision appears to match similar footage shot and broadcast by the television outlet Al Jazeera, which also shows a rocket misfire landing in Gaza. And another clip shared online by Palestinian media outlets also reportedly depicts the moment of the blast at the hospital. Jordan Schachtel, an Israeli journalist for the outlet Dossier Today, took to X to share a screenshot of Telegram messages he claims indicate Hamas militants are to blame. Hamas has rejected the claims and insisted the blast was an air strike launched by Israel, calling it “a war crime”. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned the “cold-blooded massacre”. It will “forever remain a stain on the conscience of humanity that has been witnessing the horrors committed against the Palestinian people without taking action to stop it”, a statement read. While the blame game continues, the United Nations and Doctors Without Borders have both said Israeli air strikes have hit medical facilities, including hospitals and ambulances, over the past week. And the WHO claims the hospital “was one of 20 in the north of the Gaza Strip” that had been warned to evacuate by the Israeli Defence Force. “The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, and lack of ambulances, staff, health system bed capacity, and alternative shelter for those displaced,” the WHO said. US President Joe Biden said in a statement he is “outraged and deeply saddened” by the bloodshed and indicated America will conduct its own analysis of who is responsible. Mr Biden said he had “directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened”. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese spoke of the “devastating loss of life” seen since the conflict began and said he is “deeply distressed” by the attack on the hospital in Gaza. “The protection of civilian lives must come first,” Mr Albanese told reporters. “And respect for international humanitarian law is paramount. We condemn any indiscriminate attacks and targeting of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals. Australia joins with others in calling for international law to always be upheld.” Violent protests break out Pro-Palestinian protesters have taken to the streets in multiple countries across the world, with a group in Lebanon storming part of the US Embassy. Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, called for a day of protest in response to the bombing of a hospital in Gaza, which killed hundreds. Israel has denied it launched an air strike on the hospital and has blamed a misfired rocket launched by Hamas. Hamas has rubbished the allegation. The devastating loss of life has sparked anger across the region. Thousands of protesters gathered outside America’s Embassy in Beirut and part of the heavily fortified complex was briefly breached. Vision appears to show people pouring inside part of the facility and over a fence, tearing a US flag down from a pole, replacing it with a Palestinian flag. Security forces fired off smoke bombs and tear gas in a bid to disperse the crowds. A smaller crowd had also gathered outside the French Embassy in Beirut. Vision also shows a group of protesters storming a United Nations building in Beirut and setting it alight. Following the deadly hospital blast, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh called for Palestinians to “get out and confront the occupation and the settlers”. Haniyeh also called for Arabs and Muslims across the world to take to the streets. Within hours of news of the attack breaking, protests across the world began, with angry demonstrations in Tunisia, Jordan, Türkiye, Syria, Morocco, Yemen and Lebanon. Large crowds gathered outside Israel’s embassies in the Jordanian capital of Amman and in Istanbul in Türkiye. Hundreds of Palestinians also staged demonstrations across West Bank cities, including Ramallah, the seat of power for the Palestinian Authority. Footage shows demonstrators clashing with authorities, with security forces firing tear gas on the crowd. The AFP news agency says people in the crowd were demanding Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas resign over his handling of the conflict with Israel. ‘Death to France and England’ Hundreds of furious protesters have gathered outside the French and British embassies in Tehran, after Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi declared a day of “public mourning”. “Death to France and England,” demonstrators chanted. Thousands have also gathered in Palestine Square in central Tehran. In his statement, Mr Raisi declared that “Iran is in mourning”. “The flames of the US-Israeli bombs, dropped this evening on the Palestinian victims injured at the … hospital in Gaza, will soon consume the Zionists,” he said. Joe Biden’s trip in tatters When the White House announced yesterday that Joe Biden would visit Israel and then travel on to Jordan to hold high-level talks with Palestine, there was hope America’s intervention could help ease the conflict in the region. But now, in the wake of a devastating blast at a hospital in Gaza, which is believed to have killed 500 civilians and injured scores more, those hopes are all but dashed. CNN quotes two sources as saying the White House is urgently trying to lower expectations, after Palestine pulled out of a summit in Jordan, and Jordan withdrew its invitation to Mr Biden. Egypt, which was also set to attend to broker peace talks, also refused to take part. “The presence of Biden, who places a premium on personal diplomacy, is meant to show solidarity with the United States’ closest allies and to deter rogue actors in the region from opening up a second front in the war,” CNN reports. “But the sudden cancellation Tuesday night of a major summit with Arab leaders in Jordan posed additional challenges for the president, who had hoped to return to the US after having firmly established a way for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.” The Guardian concurs with the assessment, writing: “The deadly blast has up-ended US diplomatic efforts aimed at fending off the humanitarian disaster in Gaza and thrown a dark shadow over Biden’s imminent visit to the region.” Following the blast in Gaza, Mr Biden held last-minute briefings with his national security advisers and spoke with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who remains travelling in the Middle East. CNN reports that the White House has come to no conclusion about who is responsible for the attack. Israel blames a rocket fired by a Palestinian terrorist group from within Gaza, which fell onto the hospital, while Hamas insists the Israeli Defence Force conducted an air strike. When he arrives in Tel Aviv, the president will hold high-level talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his War Cabinet. As well as providing security assistance to Israel, the US is keen to ease the humanitarian crisis gripping Palestine and open vital border crossings with Egypt to get aid into the region. “Despite ongoing discussions with Israel and other partners, sources downplayed the expectation that the visit would result immediately in a refugee deal or the release of American hostages in Hamas custody,” CNN reports. Post fuels conspiracy theories A pro-Israel social media influencer posted on X moments after the deadly blast at a Gaza hospital, celebrating the attack. Hanaya Naftali took to X, formerly Twitter, and said: “BREAKING: Israeli Air Force struck a Hamas terrorist base inside a hospital in Gaza. A multiple number of terrorists are dead.” Mr Naftali swiftly deleted the post, prompting pro-Palestinian social media users to point to it as proof Israel deliberately attacked the hospital. He posted again claiming his original remarks were a mistake. “Earlier today I shared a report that was published on @reuters about the bombing at the hospital in Gaza which falsely stated Israel struck the hospital. I mistakenly shared this information in a since deleted post in which I referenced Hamas’ routine use of hospitals to store weapons caches and conduct terrorist activity. I apologise for this error. “As the IDF does not bomb hospitals, I assumed Israel was targeting one of the Hamas bases in Gaza. “It is known that Hamas is using civilians as human shields, it is a war crime and a crime against humanity. This should be the focus.” German leader ducks for cover German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was forced from his plane as it was preparing to take off from an airport in Israel due to an air raid alarm. Mr Scholz and his staff can be seen rushing off the plane and towards a vehicle. For a moment, the German leader, who was visiting Tel Aviv for talks about the conflict, was forced to lie on the tarmac of Ben Gurion Airport. Horrifying scenes at site of hospital blast Palestinian authorities say 500 people are feared dead after the blast at al-Ahli Arab Hospital, which humanitarian groups have described as “the worst attack on a medical facility in the 21st Century”. Zaher Sahloul from the US-based MedGlobal humanitarian organisation called it “the worst attack on a medical facility in the 21st Century”. “Bombing hospitals is against international law. It is a war crime,” he said. “It compounds trauma in the Gaza Strip, sending the message that nowhere is safe, not even inside a hospital.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) demanded the immediate protection of civilians and health care in the Gaza Strip. “ WHO strongly condemns the attack on Al Ahli Arab Hospital,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X. Tamara al-Rifai, from the UN Relief and Works Agency, claimed there was “direct Israeli fire” on the hospital. “An attack on densely populated refugee camps where people are sheltering in UN schools and premises is something that is utterly shocking. It is a very sad violation of international humanitarian law. I am lost for words right now,” she told Al Jazeera. The International Committee of the Red Cross has expressed its “shocked and horrified” by the blast. “Hospitals should be sanctuaries to preserve human life, not scenes of death and destruction,” it said in a statement. “No patient should be killed in a hospital bed. No doctors should lose their lives while trying to save others. Hospitals must be protected under international humanitarian law.” Israel slams accusations it bombed hospital Israel’s Foreign Ministry also claimed it has vision that proves Hamas rockets were responsible for the blast at the hospital. “From the analysis of the operational systems of the IDF, an enemy rocket barrage was carried out towards Israel, which passed through the vicinity of the hospital when it was hit,” a post from Israel’s official account on X, formerly Twitter, reads. “According to intelligence information, from several sources we have, the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation is responsible for the failed shooting that hit the hospital.” It said that “the IDF did not conduct any operations in the area at the time of impact”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a furious statement shortly after the blast. “So the whole world knows: The barbaric terrorists in Gaza are the ones who attacked the Gaza hospital, not the IDF,” Mr Netanyahu said. “Those who cruelly murdered our children, murder their children as well.” And Israeli President Isaac Herzog has slammed allegations it launched an air strike on a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds. “An Islamic Jihad missile has killed many Palestinians at a Gazan hospital — a place where lives should be saved,” Mr Herzog said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “Shame on the media who swallow the lies of Hamas and Islamic Jihad — broadcasting a 21st-Century blood libel around the globe. Shame on the vile terrorists in Gaza who wilfully spill the blood of the innocent. “Never before has the choice been clearer. Israel is standing against an enemy made of pure evil. If you stand for humanity – for the value of all human life – you stand with Israel.” Israel is being pushed to release its intelligence it says proves it did not bomb the hospital, with a defence spokesperson said it “may” do so. “We’re in the progress of declassifying. I cannot promise yet that we will but maybe because of the importance and because what is at stake here that may happen,” the spokesperson said. When asked if Israel was “100 per cent certain” it didn’t strike the hospital, the spokesperson said: “As certain as anybody in war can be with millions of pieces of information flying around.” “But after a very serious review, I can say that is the information that we have now we are confident and the information that we have says this was a failed launch by Islamic Jihad.” Biden on his way to Israel US President Joe Biden has taken off from Andrews Air Force Base in Air Force One, headed to Israel for high-level talks. Mr Biden was due to then travel on to Jordan for a summit with Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, but he has pulled out. Mr Biden and Mr Abbas were due to meet in Oman, alongside Jordanian represents and a delegation from Egypt. But the president may skip the Jordan part of his visit entirely after the kingdom also pulled out of plans to meet with Mr Biden, and Egypt refused to attend. After the news, Mr Biden decided to cancel his visit to Jordan. “After consulting with King Abdullah II of Jordan and in light of the days of mourning announced by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, President Biden will postpone his travel to Jordan and the planned meeting with these two leaders and President Sisi of Egypt,” a White House official said. “He looks forward to consulting in person with these leaders soon and agreed to remain regularly and directly engaged with each of them over the coming days.” News of the cancelled meeting came on the back of Hamas blaming America for the bloodshed at the hospital. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a televised address that the US was to blame because it has given Israel “cover for its aggression”. Speaking after the horrific attack, which has killed 500 people, Haniyeh called on Palestinians to “get out and confront the occupation and the settlers”. “The hospital massacre confirms the enemy‘s brutality and the extent of his feeling of defeat,” he said. He added that the attack will be “a new turning point”. Haniyeh called for Arabs and Muslims across the world to stage protests against Israel. World reacts to hospital horror The White House has issued a statement, which reads: “The President sent his deepest condolences for the innocent lives lost in the hospital explosion in Gaza, and wished a speeding recovery to the wounded.” Russia and the United Arab Emirates have demanded an urgent session of the United Nations Security Council. The UN has agreed and a meeting will take place tomorrow. The request came shortly after Jordan’s King Abdullah described the situation as a “massacre” and blamed Israel for the attack. King Abdullah called for Israel to immediately end its war against Hamas, which has caused the suffering of Palestinians that is a “shame on humanity”. In the United Kingdom, Labour leader Keir Starmer said scenes at the hospital are “absolutely devastating and cannot be justified”. Mr Starmer took to X, formerly Twitter, to say: “International law must be upheld.” In Scotland, First Minister Humza Yousaf said the blast must be “unequivocally condemned in the strongest possible manner”. Mr Yousaf, who has family in Gaza, added: “There can be no justification for this. None whatsoever.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the attack is “horrific and completely unacceptable”. The French Foreign Ministry has issued a statement, which read: “International humanitarian law is binding on all and must enable the protection of civilian populations. Humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip must be opened up without delay.” French President Emmanuel Macron took to X, formerly Twitter, to offer his thoughts, writing: “Nothing can justify striking a hospital. Nothing can justify targeting civilians. “France condemns the attack on the Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, which made so many Palestinian victims. Our thoughts are with them. All the light must be shed on the circumstances.” Saudi Arabia has also condemned the “heinous crime”. Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the incident is a “devastating loss of life”. “The scenes from the explosion at a Gaza City hospital are deeply distressing,” Senator Wong wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “It is clear there has been a devastating loss of life. Our thoughts are with those killed, those injured and their loved ones. “The protection of civilian lives must come first and respect for international humanitarian law is paramount. We condemn any indiscriminate attacks and targeting of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals.” Fears of violence in Australia An international security expert is “very concerned” about the potential for lone-wolf attacks in Australia as a result of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Neil Fergus was speaking on Channel 9’s Today show this morning and said tensions here are rising. “The reality is we have a lot of people out there on different sides of this struggle who are feeling aggrieved, alienated, of course finding out that they‘ve got relatives that are missing or been hurt or kidnapped,” Mr Fergus said. The remarks come after the boss of Australia’s spy agency yesterday warned about the risk of “spontaneous violence” on home soil. Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation Director-General Mike Burgess is in San Francisco for a meeting of the Five Eyes alliance. He said: “We, of course, recognise this is a moment that drives feelings and attitudes in our respective countries and in Australia, so we’re on the lookout for that as we see protests and counterprotests … but we do anticipate spontaneous violence around these.” Aussies remain stuck in Gaza The Australian Government is hopeful another repatriation flight will be able to leave Israel today, but it all hangs on security conditions. Government-assisted flights have already evacuated more than 1500 Aussies from the conflict-torn region. Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged any remaining citizens to leave Israel as soon as possible, warning of a situation that is “highly challenging and rapidly changing”. Earlier today, Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neill confirmed there are 46 Australian citizens in Gaza. “I can’t give you the demographic information of who it is, all I know is that there are 46 Aussies with Australian passports in their hands,” Ms O’Neill told Channel 7’s Sunrise. The government has helped some 1500 people to flee the region, she added. “We’ve got to now focus our attention on those 46 people, and we’re doing everything we can. We hope that we’ll be able to report back something positive.” Aid still unable to enter Gaza A long queue of trucks packed with vital remains blocked at the Egypt border with Gaza, with a crossing between the cities of El-Arish and Rafah still closed. But there’s growing hope that humanitarian aid could begin flowing into the war-ravaged region today. “Until now, there is no safe passage that has been granted,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said. In an interview with CNN, Mr Shoukry also confirmed the border crossing at Rafah had been bombed four times in recent days. “The crossing has sustained damage, the roads, access roads between the Egyptian and Gaza side have severe damage and need repair,” he said. The death toll from the Israel-Hamas conflict continues to surge and now marks the deadliest of five wars since 2008. Gaza’s Health Ministry said 2,778 Palestinians have been killed and 9,700 wounded since 7 October. But some 1200 others are unaccounted for. More than 1400 Israelis have been killed and some 200 remain missing, held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
‘Distressing’: PM on Israeli hospital attack,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/leave-immediately-urgent-warning-to-australians-still-in-israel/news-story/cbc8a74fa0483cb5e842690c25e203f1,"Anthony Albanese has called for international law to be upheld and civilians to be protected in the wake of a devastating hospital blast in Gaza. According to reports, anywhere between 500 and 1000 people, including hundreds of children, have been killed after an explosion at Gaza City Hospital. Both Hamas and Israel are pointing fingers at each other, with neither accepting responsibility. The Prime Minister said the scenes from the hospital explosion were “deeply distressing”. “Every innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or Palestinian,” he said. “Our thoughts are with those killed, those injured, and their loved ones. “The protection of civilian lives must come first, as the parliament said in its resolution that we carried on Monday, and respect for international humanitarian law is paramount. “We condemn any indiscriminate attacks and targeting of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, and Australia joins with others in calling for international law to always be upheld.” Greens leader Adam Bandt blasted Labor’s stance and called on Mr Albanese to be “crystal clear” in condemning violence. “It’s very clear that there is an invasion in an area that is packed with civilians who have no way out,” Mr Bandt told reporters on Wednesday. “The government needs to stop suggesting that this is somehow self-defence – it has moved beyond self-defence into an invasion.” “There is a humanitarian catastrophe unfolding before our eyes. Hospitals are being bombed and people are being starved and dehydrated. What the government can do right now is call for an end to the invasion and an immediate ceasefire.” Independent MP Zoe Daniels said if Israel was behind the attack, it amounted to a “war crime”. “Protection of civilians is critical at a time of conflict and within the international rules of war,” she told ABC Radio. “Israel has a right to self defence within these parameters, but we have to be careful that a sort of tit-for-tat escalation could be very, very difficult to rein in.” Amid the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Middle East, Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil has urged Australians in Israel wanting to leave to “leave immediately” and “take the first flight offered to you”. Hundreds of Australians have already been ferried to safety out of Israel by government-assisted repatriation flights. There weretears and hugs at Sydney’s international airportwhen the first flight, loaded with 222 people, landed on Tuesday. Further flights will touch down in the days ahead, but the Australian government has paused its repatriation efforts. Defence assets will stay in the region in case there is further need, but Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil has urged Australians wanting to leave Israel to not hesitate. She said there were still about 1200 Australians in Israel still in contact with the government, but that there had been evacuation flights “coming back with empty seats on them” because people who indicated they wanted to leave “later decide not to”. “We are urging people, if you are in Israel at the moment and you want to leave, leave immediately,” she told Channel 7. “Take the first flight that is offered to you. Don’t think about other options, or that you might wait and see. “The situation in the Middle East is deteriorating rapidly. We are urging people, if you want to leave, leave. “If you and your family want to leave Israel, take the first flight that is offered to you and get back to Australia as quick as you can.” Ms O’Neil said the government was focusing its efforts on the 46 Australians stuck in Gaza, where a humanitarian crisis is afoot. “We’re doing everything we can. We hope that we’ll be able to report back something positive,” she said. There is currently no way out of the besieged strip with the Rafah crossing into Egypt closed. Humanitarian aid cannot get into Palestine, and water, food and electricity is running low because of Israel’s blockade. The decades-long conflict descended into war earlier this month after Hamas – a terrorist organisation – launched a surprise and unprovoked offensive against Israel. Hamas killed hundreds of Israelis and took about 200 people hostage. Israel has retaliated with aerial bombardment, killing thousands of Palestinians, and warned of a looming ground offensive. US President Joe Biden cancelled a planned stop in Jordan following a visit to Israel on Wednesday in the aftermath of the Gaza hospital blast. Back home in Australia, Israeli ambassador Amir Maimon addressed the Coalition in their joint party room on Tuesday. Senator Jane Hume said Mr Maimon had spoken to them about the “dire situation” in Israel. “They’re very grateful for Australia’s unequivocal support, and that is exactly what they will get,” Senator Hume said. She urged the government to do everything it could to get the 46 Australians in Gaza to safety. It comes a day after Labor senator Fatima Payman – a devout Muslim – said while Israel had a right to defend itself, it “cannot equate to the annihilation of Palestinian civilians”. “Israeli missiles strike residential dwellings, civilians, multistorey apartments, health facilities as well as places of worship, indiscriminately killing men, women and children. We must condemn it,” she told the Senate on Tuesday. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

‘Condemn it’: Aussie leaders split on Israel,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/teals-split-as-labor-mp-breaks-ranks-on-israel-in-parliament/news-story/683cef3cec8097baacb850df2d9e61d5,"Victorian MP Zoe Daniel has joined a group of fellow Teals opposing a Greens-led push to condemn Israel for war crimes, signalling a widening local political split over the Israel-Gaza war. This came as Labor Senator Fatima Payman broke party ranks to declare Australia should also condemn Israel’s killing of Palestinian civilians, after the government passed a motion condemning Hamas’ assault on Israel. Signalling a break away from Labor’s stance on the war, Senator Payman called for an “immediate ceasefire” and for parliament to condemn Israeli missile strikes “indiscriminately killing men, women and children.” “The international community loudly and proudly condemned Russia’s occupation of Ukraine when it started attacking Ukraine in 2014,” Ms Payman told the Senate. “Yet today the world watches as the state of Israel deprives the entire population - men, women and children, of the basic necessities of life - food, water, electricity, gas and medicines. “We must condemn it.” Divisions over rhetoric grew after Teal MPs Kylea Tink and Sophie Scamps joined the Greens and independent Andrew Wilkie to amend a parliamentary motion condemning Hamas’ attack to also denounce “war crimes perpetrated by the State of Israel.” This drew heavy criticism, including from Teal Goldstein MP Zoe Daniel who stated she “emphatically” disagreed with her colleagues. “Without hesitation, I voted for the motion which appropriately condemned, in the strongest possible terms, Hamas’ massacre of innocent Israelis. I did not agree with those who supported the Greens’ amendment,” Ms Daniel said. “Israel has a right to self-defence in line with the rules of war, which would include protection of civilians in Gaza, reiterating what I have said publicly, repeatedly and emphatically.” Kooyong MP Dr Monique Ryan also moved against her Teal colleagues, arguing she voted for the motion “without hesitation” “I did not agree with those who supported the Greens’ amendment,” Dr Ryan said. Defence Minister Richard Marles said the Greens’ amendment was “completely despicable”, while Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said he was “blown away” by the motion. The Greens’ amendment was eventually voted down 107 to seven. The original motion passed by an overwhelming 134 votes to four. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Heartwarming scenes as mercy flight lands,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/first-israel-repatriation-flight-to-land-in-sydney-on-tuesday/news-story/a8a9024a4eec5860a9d1946fa1dbd92b,"Tears, hugs and welcome home balloons filled the arrival hall at Sydney’s International Airport after the first Israel repatriation flight landed in Sydney. A total of 222 Australians stranded in Israel flew in on a Qatar flight from Dubai to Sydney about 6pm on Tuesday. Roughly half of the flight were reunited outside Kingsford Smith’s Arrivals B gate, with the remainder of the flight progressing to domestic services provided by Virgin. Sydney residents Alan and Judy Landis were one of the dozen or so families and friends waiting for their family to arrive. Mr Landis was equipped with a ‘Welcome to Sydney’ balloon and a pink unicorn soft toy for his 14-month-old granddaughter, said he was “ecstatic” at the arrival of his younger son, his wife and grandchild. “They will be safe now. It’s just a shocking situation for Israel and the whole region,” he said. Despite this, his younger son and his family have chosen to remain in Tel Aviv. “It was a very difficult decision for my younger son to leave Tel Aviv,” he said. “(My sons) lived 30 minutes away from each other and were together every weekend. “But my younger son is able to do some work here.” The two generations were united in a teary exchange, in front of the Arrivals B gate. Mr Landis’ son Michael, and his daughter-in-law, Lenore Medin were full of praise for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trading. “I’m so grateful for what they’ve been giving us. All the communication, the support, and emails,” he said. Michael said coming back to Sydney was bittersweet, after living in Israel for the last seven years. “You feel so much guilt leaving your family in such a difficult situation,” he told cameras and reporters shortly after exiting customs. “We only made the decision to leave in the last day or so. We were exploring our options and he (Michael’s older brother) is doing the same with his family.” The first passenger to exit the terminal, Dana Gilden, quickly walked into the embrace of her parents. “I didn’t have any time to process it all, I was just eyeing my parents,” she said. “I can’t even think straight. My head is a blur. I feel like I’m in a literal dream.” She counts both Sydney and Israel as her home but said she needed a “calm environment” to decide on whether she wanted to return to Tel Aviv. “I’m back for my family. They really needed me back.” It’s understood further domestic flights will be operated by Virgin Australia, with both Qatar and Virgin offering the flights free of charge in a move welcomed by the Australian government. A second flight operated by Qantas will depart London’s Heathrow Airport at Tuesday 9am local time, and is scheduled to arrive in Sydney on Wednesday evening. Present to greet the first flight after they landed, Executive Council of the Jewry president Jillian Segal praised the work of Qantas, Virgin and Qatar. “They are very happy to be back in Australia, and they are so grateful to the Australian government, who they’ve praised to the hilt,” she said. Federal Senator Deborah O’Neill, who is also the chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Israel said she saw returning Australians shed tears of relief, happiness and concern. She said extraordinary efforts had been made by Australian representatives in Dubai, who began work at 4am local time to ensure the necessary paperwork had been completed for the returning passengers. “People were standing in the queue, so happy to be back home, with their heart in two places (and) with incredible concern and anxiety about what’s happening for the people that they love back home in Israel,” she said. “To have that little blue passport with Australia on it, and the emu and the kangaroo, has never meant more to those people who were there today with their family returning.” On Tuesday morning, Defence Minister Richard Marles said no further repatriation flights are planned to leave Israel, after two lights carrying 194 left Tel Aviv for Dubai overnight. “We believe that these flights do meet the immediate demand on the part of Australians to leave Israel,” he said. “That said, we are keeping a couple of Air Force planes in the region as a contingency over the coming days.” He said the government were currently in contact with at least 45 Australians who are currently in Gaza, and will be assisting them to reach safety. “We are encouraging them to move south within Gaza, to heed the call of Israel in that respect and we’re working with our friends in the international community to see whether a humanitarian corridor can be established out of Gaza, but at this stage that hasn’t happened,” he said.

‘Spontaneous violence’: Australia on alert,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/asio-head-warns-of-local-spontaneous-violence-following-israelhamas-war/news-story/ef88f059d2a8735e5f85427e09de79e4,"The chiefs of domestic intelligence agencies in Australia and the United States have jointly cautioned over the heightened threat of violence resulting from Hamas’ blooding incursion in Israel. Speaking in a joint press conference before an intelligence conference in Palo Alto, California, ASIO chief Mike Burgess and FBI director Christopher Wray said threats of domestic terrorism in their respective countries were “evolving continually”. “We, of course, recognise this is a moment that drives feelings and attitudes in our respective countries and in Australia, so we’re on the lookout for that as we see protests and counter protests … but we do anticipate spontaneous violence around these,” Burgess said in comments reported byThe Sydney Morning Herald. “We do see a direct correlation between language that inflames tension and out of that tension does grow a small number of people who think violence is the answer. “It’s something that we all have to be mindful of, and that’s for all Australians to play their part.” Asked by reporters if his message was also directed at politicians – some of whom have been accused of stoking tensions including Opposition Leader Peter Dutton – director-general Burgess replied it was “for everybody”. FBI director Wray said his agency had detected an increase in reported threats against Americans of Jewish and Muslim faith since the conflict commenced. “We’re particularly alert to the potential that these events have to inspire violence against Jewish Americans, against Muslim Americans, institutions, houses of worship here et cetera,” director Fray said. “And I will say over the past week, we’ve seen an increase in reported threats to those groups right here in the United States, and we’ve been working with our partners all across law enforcement and with faith-based communities to assess those threats as they come in and to mitigate them.” Last week, Burgess cautioned the agency was on high alert for politically or religiously motivated violence. “ASIO is carefully monitoring the situation for any indications of planned violence. Were we to see any, we would respond accordingly, along with our law enforcement partners,” the director-general said in a statement released on Thursday. While the national terrorism threat level remains “possible”, Burgess warned against extremists escalating protests to stoke community disharmony. Burgess’ warning follows the controversial pro-Palestinian protest in Sydney last week where activists burned the Israeli flag and chanted anti-Semitic slogans. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Hostage’s tearful mother pleads with Hamas,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-conflict-israeli-family-of-five-found-dead-in-an-embrace/news-story/6d79f51f5bcc759020697fa44e63e33b,"The Israeli military has shown a small group of journalists an hour-long cut of horrifying vision showing Hamas terrorists mercilessly massacring civilians, including children and the elderly. It comes as US President Joe Biden announced he will visit Israel on Wednesday for high-level talks about the worsening conflict in Palestine, as Iran threatened to involve itself in the war. Some 2000 American troops have been ordered to “prepare to deploy” as US warships head to the region.

Militants attempt to ‘infiltrate’ Israel Israeli troops killed four militants attempting to enter its territory from Lebanon on Tuesday, the army said, as tensions run high on the border between the two countries. Israel has traded fire with Hezbollah and allied Palestinian militants in Lebanon on a near-daily basis since October 8, the day after Hezbollah’s Palestinian ally Hamas launched its surprise attack in Israeli territory. The Israeli army said its forces opened fire on militants who had attempted to cross the northern border with Lebanon in the morning. “Observation troops spotted a terrorist squad attempting to infiltrate the security fence with Lebanon and plant an explosive device,” the army said in a statement, adding that “four terrorists were killed”. Later, anti-tank missiles targeted Israeli forces in two locations, with Israeli tanks and artillery retaliating against the “origins of the fire” and Hezbollah military posts, the army said. Shots “fired from a light weapon” also targeted several Israeli military positions near Lebanon, it added. Hezbollah said in a statement afterwards that its fighters had targeted “a Zionist tank in the Ramim barracks” at noon. Two Israeli military reservists and a civilian were wounded in one of the attacks, the army said. Turkey talking to Hamas about hostages Turkey’s Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, says his country is speaking to Hamas about the release of civilians, children and foreigners who are still being held hostage in Gaza. According to Reuters, Mr Fidan personally spoke to the leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, about the issue yesterday. Hostage’s mother speaks out The mother of French-Israeli woman Mia Shem, held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza, urged world leaders Tuesday to free her daughter after the Islamists aired a video showing her in captivity. “I ask world leaders that my daughter be returned to us in the state that she is today, as well as the other hostages,” Keren Shem said at a press conference in Tel Aviv. She was speaking a day after Hamas broadcast a video showing her daughter receiving treatment for a wounded arm. “I beg the world to return my baby to me,” Ms Shem said, after French President Emmanuel Macron demanded her immediate and unconditional release. Ms Shem said her daughter was at a rave party in the desert near the border when she was abducted to Gaza during the deadly attack Hamas militants launched on Israel on October 7. “Now she is in Gaza. She is not the only one. There are many adults, children, babies and Holocaust survivors,” she said of other Israelis and foreigners held by militants. “It is a crime against humanity. All together we need to stop this terror.” Ms Shem said she had not known whether her daughter “was alive or dead” until Hamas released the video footage of her. “There was a rumour saying that she was wounded in the shoulder or the leg. She was wounded in the hand. She was operated on,” Ms Shem said. “She looks terrified. She says what they tell her to say. I’m really worried about her.” Ultimate fate of Gaza a ‘global issue’ Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israeli military, has stressed that the fate of the Gaza Strip after the war would be a “global issue”. “This is a global issue, what the situation will look like in this region,” Mr Hagari said. “Gaza borders other countries. So when we say things on the final status (of Gaza), they will combine the orders of the political level and the military. “We’ve had all kinds of end games.” He was responding to a question about Israel’s intentions, and whether it would occupy Gaza after the looming ground invasion. Over 50 killed in southern Gaza airstrikes Palestine’s interior ministry has confirmed 23 people have died in Israeli strikes in Khan Younis, a city in the southern Gaza strip. 28 more were killed in strikes in the Rafah area near the Egyptian border. It came as the Israel Defence Force’s Chief-of-Staff Herzi Halevi said Israel were destined to defeat Hamas in a signed statement. “The IDF will win thanks to sticking to the mission, fortitude, and courage,” he said. “The IDF will win because our war is just. The IDF will win thanks to the resilience of the people from which it comes. It will win thanks to its abilities and because we trained for this task. We will win, and in all actions, we will act according to the spirit of the IDF and its values,” Halevi stated. Iran warns it may take ‘pre-emptive action’ In a major escalation, Iran has issued a warning that it may take “pre-emptive action in the coming hours” against Israel in response to preparations for a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip. Tehran has previously cautioned that any invasion of Gaza would trigger a response from various fronts, as resistance leaders continue to refute Israel’s right to continue on its warpath act without consequences. The United States has begun to prepare 2,000 troops for potential deployment to the area and has now positioned a second aircraft carrier in the eastern Mediterranean. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said he had discussed the deteriorating situation in a recent meeting with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, suggesting that “pre-emptive action by the resistance axis” was a necessary response to the chaos unfolding in Gaza. Israel can’t “do whatever it wants in Gaza and then go after other resistance groups after it‘s done with Gaza,“ Amirabdollahian said. “If the limited and extremely tight windows of opportunity available to the United Nations and political actors are not used over the coming hours, opening new fronts against the Zionist regime is inevitable.” He did not specify what that action could entail but said: “All options are open and we cannot be indifferent to the war crimes committed against the people of Gaza”. Iran President Ebrahim Raisi warned that time is running out to find a political solution and said the conflict could quickly spill over across the continent without precise action. ‘Living a horror movie’: Situation deteriorates in Gaza Life has quickly become a living hell for those still stuck in Gaza, as debris piles up on the street and civilians facing mass shortages in food and medical supplies. In hospitals, water is in such a short supply that patients are reportedly only being given 350mL per day. Humanitarian officials have continued to rally for an end to the violence as the city’s healthcare system deteriorates, leaving countless patients in critical condition stranded. Husam Zomlot, a Palestinian diplomat in the UK says that Israel is preparing for the “mass slaughter, not of Hamas but of my people”. “We should believe Israel’s defence minister when he says Palestinians are simply human animals,” the diplomat told the BBC describing the situation on the ground as “living a horror movie”. The fighting continues in and around the region, with the The Israeli Air Force now confirming it has hit Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in addition to its fight against Hamas. This is a modal window.

More than 1400 Israelis were killed and thousands more injured. Retaliatory strikes on Gaza have claimed the lives of 2800 Palestinians. Overnight, a small group of journalists covering the conflict were gathered by a member of the Israel Defence Force and shown the macabre vision. They were not allowed to record or use any of the vision presented. Mobile phones were confiscated. Recounting what he saw,Matt Gutman from US broadcaster ABC wroteabout seeing Hamas fighters travelling through the streets in the back of a ute, heavily armed with RPGs. They can be seen waving down unsuspecting motors and then opening fire. Bodies are ripped out of bullet-riddled cars. Footage then shows militants sneaking into a kibbutz in Beeri at about 8am. As one enters a playground, he asks in Arabic: “Where are the kids?” Two terrorists set fire to a house and shoot dead an elderly man. Another is shown stomping on a dying man’s face with his boot. “Another pair screams, ‘Allahu Akbar’ as they use a garden hoe to try to decapitate another man,” Gutman writes. “In another house, a gunman sticks the muzzle of his rifle into a room inhabited by a family. It‘s a mash of colours. In one, a terrorist is standing on an Israeli man’s chest and shoots him point-blank in the face. “Then, the scenes of bloodied bedrooms start to blur. The rooms and the gore are the same – it‘s how the bodies are arrayed in death that’s different. “There are so many children. Some are jam-packed together in a slippery mass of human flesh. Huge blood stains streak the tiles.” Countless charred bodies can be seen, and he notes that it’s unclear if they were set on fire or whether grenade sparked a blaze. “Other videos show Israeli first responders trying to put out the still-smouldering skeletal remains of victims – with water bottles, as if watering a parched plant,” he writes. In another clip shown, militants can be seen tossing grenades into roadside bomb shelters somewhere in southern Israel. They were filled with young people who fled terrorists at the Supernova music festival, he wrote. “The camera shows a flash of limbs, some dismembered, some still attached to writhing, screaming bodies. A selfie camera shows a young man weeping, while someone croaks hoarsely in the background, ‘help, help’. “Hamas then drags survivors out, some by their hair, to trucks, and then batters them some more in the backs of the pick-ups on the way to Gaza.” Elsewhere, vision shows “the sheer number of Hamas attackers” who set on the music festival. “Those were some of the most professional and well-equipped fighters we saw in the video. Some of them are wearing police uniforms, others are in military uniforms.” This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

The presentation ended with clips of a Hamas attack on a military base near the border with Gaza, in which about 20 female soldiers wearing pyjamas can be seen ducking for cover. They are unarmed and screaming. A woman filming the scene can be heard saying “Who is that man?” She pans and a Hamas fighter is seen, before the clip ends. Of the scene, Gutman writes: “Outside, soldiers are decapitated. Otherwise, the bodies seem untouched. The heads were not in the images.” Biden heading to Israel United States President Joe Biden will visit Israel for high-level talks about the escalating conflict with Hamas in Palestine, after Iran threatened to become involved “within hours”. Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the visit, during which Mr Biden will “reaffirm the United States’ solidarity … and iron-clad commitment to its security”. “The president will hear from Israel what it needs to defend its people as we continue to work with Congress to meet those needs,” Mr Blinken said. Confirmation of the visit came shortly before a bombshell report in the New York Times, which claims Israel has requested a whopping US$10 billion (AU$15 billion) emergency military aid package from the US. While in Israel, Mr Biden will also “underscore our crystal-clear message” to others to not seek to take advantage of the crisis “to attack Israel”. “To that end, he has deployed aircraft carrier groups and other military assets to the region.” That warning to “state or non-state” forces and the president’s confirmed visit to Israel on Wednesday came just moments after Iran issued a stern threat that is prepared to involve itself in the conflict. Mr Blinken flew out of Tel Aviv shortly after his press conference, and not long after that, one of America’s top generals flew in. Army General Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command, landed in Israel just before dawn in a surprise visit. “I‘m here to ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself, particularly focused on avoiding other parties expanding the conflict,“ he told Reuters. Major Kurilla is expected to hold high-level talks with Israeli Defence Force officials. Israel striking targets in Lebanon The alarming remarks came shortly after the Israeli Defence Force confirmed it has begun “striking Hezbollah terrorist targets in Lebanon”. Israel had earlier ordered the evacuation of some 28 villages along its northern border with Lebanon. A short while ago, the IAF struck terror targets and military infrastructure of the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon, in response to fire yesterday (Monday) towards Israel.pic.twitter.com/6AP56PSHld Hezbollah, a militant group backed by Iran, said it had struck five Israeli targets. Yesterday, Amirabdollahian warned: “We have conveyed our message to the Zionist regime through its allies that if they do not cease their atrocities in Gaza, Iran cannot simply remain an observer.” He also warned the US it will suffer “significant damages” if the conflict in Gaza escalates. Aussies warned of ‘spontaneous violence’ here The head of Australia’s spy agency has warned about the potential for violence here because of heightened tensions sparked by the Israel-Palestine conflict. ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess is in San Francisco for a summit of the Five Eyes alliance – an intelligence cooperative comprising Australia, New Zealand, America, Canada and the United Kingdom. Mr Burgess appeared at a joint press conference with the FBI’s Director Christopher Wray before the meeting, at which he said ASIO anticipates “spontaneous violence”. He urged all Australians to do their bit to minimise tensions. “We, of course, recognise this is a moment that drives feelings and attitudes in our respective countries, and in Australia, so we’re on the lookout for that as we see protests and counterprotests, but we do anticipate spontaneous violence,” Mr Burgess said. “We do see a direct correlation between language that inflames tension and out of that tension does grow a small number of people who think violence is the answer.” Civilians ‘tied together and set alight’ WARNING: Distressing content Forensic scientists have given a horrifying insight into the task of identifying the remains of hundreds of people massacred in attacks by Hamas terrorists. Israel’s National Centre of Forensic Medicine are relying on fingerprints, dental records and DNA testing to put names to the countless bodies that fill its morgue. “We decided to show this horror because there are people who accuse us of lying, of telling stories and of actually showing dog bones,” the centre’s director Hen Kugel told the AFP. Among the remains are those of an adult and a child, consisting of bones and chunks of flesh, held together with a melt electrical cord. “The posture of the two bodies shows that the adult tried to protect the child,” Mr Kugel told the AFP. “On the scanner, we clearly see two spinal columns. That of a man or a woman, and that of a child. They were tied up then burned alive.” Most of the bodies are riddled with bullets, charred beyond recognition or heavily militated, he said. At least 1400 Israelis were killed in a series of co-ordinated attacks by Hamas terrorists. In retaliation, Israel’s Defence Force launched a bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip, which has killed scores of people. Hamas has strongly denied claims its fighters abused and tortured civilians, including allegations babies were beheaded, but Mr Kugel said the forensic analysis is clear. Among the bodies in his morgue are those of infants. “I’ve been doing this job for 31 years,” Mr Kugel said. “I’ve never seen such barbarity, such cruelty, such relentlessness. It’s just atrocious. “We don’t know how many babies died, or how many elderly people. There are also a lot of headless bodies. It will take a little more time to identify everyone.” Nurit Boublil, the head of the genetic identification unit, confirmed 500 bodies have been identified so far. “Everything is made more difficult by the fact that often those who were tortured were tied together,” Mr Boublil said. The AFP also visited Shura military base near the Israeli town of Ramla, where similar work is being carried out to identify victims. Rabbi Israel Weiss said refrigerated containers lined up outside a facility each hold up to 50 bodies. “Never in my life have I seen the horrors that lie behind us today,” Rabbi Weiss told the AFP. “I have seen babies, women and men beheaded. I have seen a pregnant woman with her belly torn open and the baby cut out.” US troops told ‘prepare to deploy’ The Pentagon has issued “prepare to deploy” orders to some 2000 American troops headed towards Israel, sources have told the Wall Street Journal. A rapid response force from the US Marines will join a larger group of warships and personnel that American officials hope sends a message to Iran and Lebanon militant group Hezbollah. The Wall Street Journal and CNN both quoted sources as saying the 2000 troops are preparing to offer medical and logistical support. Both report US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin issued the order yesterday. The Biden Administration has not officially confirmed the move. The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) has been stationed near Kuwait undergoing a scheduled exercise, which wrapped early “as a result of emerging events”, the Marine Corps Times reported. The unit specialises in crisis response, special operations, amphibious operations and humanitarian assistance, CNN reported. However, defence sources told the outlet boots would not be put on the ground in Israel itself, but instead could operation from friendly nations in the region. It could also remain on board the USS Bataan in the Red Sea off Israel’s southern coast. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told the Wall Street Journal: “I don’t have more to provide at this time. I might be able to give you more details later, but at this time I just don’t have anything more specific to add to.” Hospitals at breaking point Israeli bombing of Gaza has killed more than 2800 people, the Palestinian Authority has reported, but scores more have been seriously injured. Hospitals in the region are overwhelmed and at risk of running out of water and electricity, humanitarian groups say. This morning, ABC Radio National spoke with Leo Cans, the head of mission for Palestine for charity group Doctors Without Borders. “MSF staff are distressed,” Mr Cans said. “In an operating theatre there‘s normally have six or seven medical staff. Right now, they are doing an operation with two … so it’s a very degraded way of working but they’re still here, still working for the patients.” It is only a matter of time before hospitals are depleted of supplies, which will put the lives of patients at risk, he added. “This is something that is known and could be prevented just by letting fuel and supplies inside Gaza. “What is ahead of us is beyond words, and it‘s hard to believe but it seems there is a road that has been taken and until now there has been no sign of changing direction, but at the end of the road it’s a big wall, and this big wall is full of dead people.” Urgent efforts to get aid in At his preference earlier, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said America and Israel “have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from multilateral organisations to reach civilians in Gaza”. “It is critical that aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible,” Mr Blinkin told reporters. “We share concern that Hamas may seize or destroy aid entering Gaza or otherwise prevent it from reaching the people who need it. “If Hamas in any way blocks humanitarian assistance from reaching civilians including by seizing the aid itself, we‘ll be the first to come to condemn it and work to prevent it from happening again.” Water supplies in Gaza remain cut-off and local authorities say supplies are rapidly running out. The World Health Organisation said Palestinians face an “imminent” health crisis. Meanwhile, the United Nations said its fuel trucks have been blocked from entering Gaza. An estimated one million people have been displaced within Gaza. ‘Despicable’: JK Rowling slams Hamas British author JK Rowling has shared a heartbreaking post about a 12-year-old Israeli girl being held hostage by Hamas terrorists in Gaza. The original post on X, formerly Twitter, from Israel’s official account shows a photograph of Noya, who has autism. In it, she is dressed in a Harry Potter costume and holding a wand and a book. Officials said the child was abducted from her home by militants. She is being held somewhere in Palestine. “Noya, is sensitive, kind, funny and a massive Harry Potter fan,” the post read. Rowling shared the post and condemned the act, writing: “Kidnapping children is despicable and wholly unjustifiable.” She said the picture “hit home with me” for “obvious reasons”. “May Noya and all hostages taken by Hamas be returned soon, safely, to their families,” Rowling wrote. Overnight, a Hamas terrorist released a video statement confirming the group has between 200 and 250 Israeli hostages. Sydney man arrested over pro-Palestine protest New South Wales Police have arrested and charged a man over alleged offensive comments made during a pro-Palestine protest at the weekend. Sydney City Police Area Command officers commenced an investigation after reports of offensive behaviour at Sunday’s demonstrate in the CBD. “Following extensive inquiries, investigators arrested a 63-year-old man at a home in Mt Druitt about 8pm yesterday,” NSW Police said in a statement. The man was taken to Mt Druitt Police Station and charged with use offensive language in/near public place/school. He has been granted strict conditional bail and will appear at Downing Centre Local Court on 15 November. NSW Police deployed more than 1000 officers as part of Operation Shelter, formed following ugly scenes at a pro-Palestine rally last Monday. Vision of that protest showed some men in the crowd chanting “gas the Jews” and “f*** the Jews”, sparking condemnation. Police had urged plans for Sunday’s protest to be abandoned but organisers pushed on. Vision shows young Israeli hostage There are at least 200 hostages being held in Gaza following co-ordinate attacks on Israel on 7 October by the terrorist group Hamas. The figure was confirmed in a televised statement by the group’s military spokesperson Au Obeida, although he said there could be up to 250 people held. One of those is Israeli woman Mia Shem, 21, who was snatched from a desert music festival in Kibbutz Re’im where Hamas militants massacred hundreds of civilians. Hamas has released chilling footage of Ms Shem, showing her being treated for a wound on her arm. “I’m being cared for, I’m getting medications,” she said in the footage. “I’m only asking for me to be returned home as soon as possible, to my family, to my parents, to my siblings. Please get me out of here as soon as possible.” “From the second the reports started I called her cell phone,” her mother Karen Shem told Army Radio. “And the phone has been ringing for hours, but there‘s no answer. I demand to know, someone should tell me something. No one has looked for me. I did everything I could to let everyone know that my daughter is missing, but no one has contacted me.” ‘Blown away’: Dutton slams Teals Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has lashed Teal independents over their stance on Israel, after the pair supported an attempt by the Greens to condemn Israel’s so-called “war crimes”. In Parliament yesterday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese moved a motion to condemn the attacks on Israel by Hamas terrorists. Mr Albanese’s motion called for the release of hundreds of hostages held in Gaza and acknowledged a “devastating loss of Israeli and Palestinian life”. But Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens, pushed an amendment dumping the motion of support for Israel, replacing it with a condemnation of the country’s bombing of Gaza. Independents MPs Sophie Scamps and Kylea Tink supported the amendment. It was ultimately defeated. Speaking on 3AW Radio in Melbourne this morning, Mr Dutton said he was “blown away” by the support from the Teals. “I mean, the Greens are predictable because they were always going to be voting the way they did, but for the teals to cross over and vote with them, and against Israel, it was quite remarkable,” he said. “There’s obviously a broad range of views on the issue in the Labor Party – and we saw that after the Hamas terrorist attacks a week ago – but all of them lined up and voted in favour of the motion. “There was no person from Labor who abstained or voted against and, and yet the teals decided to vote with the Greens, which is quite remarkable.” Jetstar flight abandoned in Sydney Aflight from Sydney to Melbourne this morning has been abandonedand passengers on board removed after a man began acting erratically. The Jetstar JQ501 service was preparing for takeoff at about 6.20am when the crew became concerned about someone and called the Australian Federal Police. News.com.au understands the man had been acting strangely shortly after boarding, asking for a seat change and then not moving, then asking to go to the toilet but not using it. The plane returned to the gate and officers came on board to conduct a welfare check. After speaking with the man, it’s understood AFP officers were comfortable for him to remain on board and for the plane to depart, but the passenger decided to disembark the plane. It’s at this point he became involved in a verbal exchange with another passenger about the Israel-Palestine conflict, it’s been reported. “Because they were talking about the war it made us all very nervous,” a man who was on the plane told 2GB Radio. All passengers were then removed for operational reasons. The flight eventually departed for Melbourne at about 8.45am. Israeli family of five found dead in an embrace Harrowing accounts continue to emerge about the unprecedented attack by Hamas terrorists on Israel, including a couple who were killed three days before their planned engagement — and a family of five whose bodies were found in a tragic embrace. Aviv Kutz, 54, was found embracing his wife, Livnat, 49, daughter, Rotem, 19, and sons Yonatan, 17, and Yiftach, 17, as they lay dead in a bed at their Kfar Aza home on Oct. 7, the day the terrorists invaded Israel, according to theTimes of Israel. “On the day they were murdered, we were supposed to visit them,” the children’s aunt, Adi Levy Salama, said of the family that had returned to Israel after living in Boston for several years. “Aviv organised an annual kite festival along the fence with Gaza to show them that we just want to live in peace,” Ms Salama told the outlet. Livnat, a graphic designer who was about to turn 50, was born during the Yom Kippur War — the 1973 conflict that has been compared to the current crisis in terms of Israel’s intelligence failure. Her husband was deputy director of a consulting firm and also worked in agriculture, the Times of Israel reported. Rotem was an IDF soldier who trained new recruits, while Yonatan and Yiftach attended the Kfar Hayarok boarding school in Ramat Hasharon near Tel Aviv and played basketball in the Hapoel youth program. “They were all amazing kids with huge hearts. They had their whole lives ahead of them,” their heartbroken aunt said. Number of Aussies remain in Gaza The government has confirmed the number of Australians known to be in Gaza is 45, more than double the figure released yesterday. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles described the situation as “extremely difficult”. “We are looking at ways in which and working very hard to find ways in which we can get those people to safety,” Mr Marles told ABC News Breakfast. “That obviously includes working with other countries around the establishment of a humanitarian corridor out of Gaza. “That hasn’t happened yet. But we are doing what we can in very, very challenging circumstances.” Full details of where those Australians are remains unclear, he said, as well as whether any have managed to escape into Egypt. Eerie image of Hamas terrorist The face of a senior Hamas terrorist has been revealed in a televised statement, in which he confirms hundreds of Israeli hostages are being held. Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeida said between 200 and 250 prisoners are being held in Gaza. Another 50 are being held captive elsewhere “by resistance factions and in other places”, Obeida added. He described the hostages as “our guests” and said they will be released when conditions “on the ground” make it possible. In his video address, Obeida said a promised ground assault by Israeli soldiers of Gaza “doesn’t scare us” and said the group is “ready for it”. ‘High price to pay’ Israeli has vowed to wage a “long war” against Hamas in Palestine as international pleas for a ceasefire fall on deaf ears. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that the country had high hopes of a successful campaign. “Let me tell you, Mr Secretary, this will be a long war, the price will be high, but we are going to win – for Israel, for the Jewish people and for the values that both countries believe in,” Mr Gallant said. There would be no ceasefire to allow foreign civilians to flee from Gaza across the Egypt border. The meeting came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet were forced to shelter in a bunker when air raid sirens went off in Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, thousands of Israeli civilians have been armed in cities across the country as part of civilian units. Police commissioner Kobi Shabtai and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir issued a statement confirming the 13,200 volunteers received rifles and protective gear. Hopes build for border crossing opening Thousands of Palestinians have gathered near a border crossing between Rafah and Egypt after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced it would open soon. But overnight, an area near the border was hit by shelling, prompting renewed warnings from international aid groups. In a video address, Martin Griffiths, United Nations Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief, declared “we are living in the worst of times”. “You cannot ask people to move out of harm’s way without assisting them to do it, to go to places of their choice where they want to be safe and with the humanitarian aid they need to make that journey safely,” Mr Griffiths said. He warned hospitals in Gaza are “running out of fuel, are running out of supplies” and urged Israel to allow access for aid. Discussions led by Mr Blinken had given the UN hope that progress will be made, he said, adding: “I’m hoping to hear some good news this morning”. “We need access for aid,” Mr Griffiths said. Meanwhile, World Health Organisation regional director Ahmed Al-Mandhari warned Gaza is at risk of turning into “a real catastrophe”. Supplies of water, electricity and fuel could run out within the next 24 hours, Mr Al-Mandhari told AFP. Without urgent aid, doctors should “prepare death certificates for their patients”. Tel Aviv shelled heavily Multiple rockets have been intercepted by Israeli’s ‘iron dome’ defence system overnight, with Tel Aviv subjected to a major barrage. Hamas took responsibility for the attacks. There are no reports of the rockets making ground impact. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
Heston slams ABC after court win,https://www.news.com.au/national/courts-law/former-soldier-heston-russell-savages-abc-after-court-win/news-story/99b1be30d197509ad2e7c0e8e6083be7,"A special forces soldier awarded almost $400,000 after he was defamed by the ABC has slammed the national broadcaster for its “cloak and dagger” behaviour. Heston Russell sued the ABC and two journalists over stories published in 2020 and 2021 that he claimed implied he was involved in the shooting of an unarmed prisoner. Federal Court Justice Michael Lee presided over the months-long proceedings and on Monday ruled in favour of Mr Russell, who served with the ADF in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr Russell told 2GB’s Ben Fordham, who sat next to the former soldier in court, that he believed “justice was served”, but did not hold back in his criticism of the ABC. “I think this whole trial exposes how dangerous the echo chamber is there at the ABC, in particular the investigations unit that allowed such red flags to be missed,” he said. “It’s also hilarious, this indirect behaviour, where they won’t issue a public apology when we ask for it, but overnight – cloak and dagger – they’ll take down these articles.” Mr Russell told Mr Fordham the articles had been taken down sometime on Monday night by the ABC, who he said had not contacted him since the judgement was delivered. It comes as Mr Russell prepares to return to court for a hearing into his legal fees, which if granted could cost the taxpayer – along with damages – almost $2 million dollars. Mr Russell also revealed that defamation lawyer Sue Chrysanthou SC had represented the former soldier on a “no win, no fee” basis, and that he couldn’t have otherwise afforded her. The cases stems from a series of articles that Justice Lee agreed gave the imputation Mr Russell was involved in the alleged shooting of an unarmed prisoner in Afghanistan. The allegations arose from a US Marine named “Josh’ who contacted journalist Mark Willacy about claims he had heard, but not witnessed, what he believed was a gunshot on radio. Mr Russell held back in criticising Mr Willacy’s work, stating “I don't want to launch my own defamation case”, but described comments by the journalist as “flippant and arrogant”. “He (Mr Willacy) needs to do a lot as to reflection of the why he decided to sit behind the freedoms that we fought for and attack those who are out there fighting for it,” he said. “Why he refused to accept criticism and why he so happily, in his own words, put an article out there trying to get a reaction without the consideration for the damage it has done. “He spent two months writing an article … we were over there on that one deployment for five months, and we lost one of our best on the day that he published that article.” Mr Russell first spoke out against the article to Daily Telegraph reporter Jonathon Moran, vehemently denying the allegations put forward in the ABC article. During trial, the court heard journalist Mark Willacy had then told his source to let him know “if you hear from any Aussie journos”. Mr Russell claimed on Tuesday that he had not been provided a right to reply by the ABC, and that the broadcaster had refused an editorial compliant until pressured by Mr Fordham. The court judgment came only months after another high profile defamation case involving former special forces soldier Ben Roberts-Smith, who sued multiple newspapers. Mr Roberts-Smith, the country’s most decorated soldier, had his case thrown out after a judgement deemed allegations he had killed an unarmed prisoner were true.",
Charges laid after pro-Palestine rally,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/crime/man-charged-over-comments-allegedly-made-at-propalestine-rally/news-story/bc4db5f75b6ef1536b4c9718c9fa4c5e,"A man has been charged after allegedly making offensive comments during a Pro-Palestine rally. Palestinians have fled their homes as they prepare for Israeli armed forced to launch a ground invasion on north Gaza within hours. About 6,000 people turned out to show their support for Palestinians at a rally held in Hyde Park on Sunday. The 63-year-old man was charged with using offensive language at the rally. He was arrested at his Mount Druitt home at 8pm on Monday and taken to the local police station. The man was granted strict conditional bail and is due to appear at Downing Centre Local Court on November 15. More than 100 officers were out in Sydney on Sunday though no arrests were made. Police bolstered their force after a rally the weekend before attracted demonstrators who were caught on film chanting anti-Semitic slogans outside the Opera House. Huge crowds were seen in front of Melbourne’s State Library, many wearing red, green and white – the Palestinian flag colours. Protesters were caught lighting flares against the wishes of police. “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” the crowds were heard chanting. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called for urgent action after an alarming spike in the number of women killed by domestic violence.

Number of Aussie children stuck in Gaza,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/australia-working-to-evacuate-45-citizens-stuck-in-gaza-as-humanitarian-crisis-unfolds/news-story/ae55d1a8ed552b06d6c590bcf7a380a9,"The Albanese government is doing “what we can” to help the 45 Australians stranded in war-torn Gaza, Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said. Last week, the government said they were aware of 19 Australians in the besieged strip, but Mr Marles confirmed that more than double that amount of people had since made contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He said that figure “includes families”. Gaza is without food, electricity, fuel, and other key supplies after Israel ordered a total blockade last week in the wake of Hamas’ deadly attacks last weekend. Hamas is still holding Israelis hostage and has killed more than 1400 civilians, prompting Israel to launch rockets at the Gaza Strip for the last week. Israel is preparing to launch a ground offensive at any moment. To date, more than 2700 people in Gaza have been killed by Israel’s retaliatory strikes. As part of their pledge to destroy Hamas, Israel ordered Gazans living in the northern half of the territory to move south, but strikes have continued. The only way to safety – through the southern border into Egypt – remains closed. The United Nations has repeatedly warned about the unfolding humanitarian crisis. Mr Marles said the situation was “obviously extremely difficult” but the government was doing everything it could to get those Australians to safety. Mr Marles said DFAT had been “encouraging” the Australians in Gaza to move south. “We are looking at ways in which, and working very hard to find ways in which we can get those people to safety, and that obviously includes working with other countries around the establishment of a humanitarian corridor out of Gaza. “That hasn’t happened yet, but we are doing what we can in very, very challenging circumstances.” Mr Marles said he didn’t have the precise breakdown of who the 45 Australians were, but given there were families caught up in it he’d “imagine” children were among the group. “There isn't a humanitarian corridor out of Gaza. But we continue to work with others in the international community to see that established,” he said. Meanwhile, more than 600 Australians have been ferried to safety out of Israel on government-assisted repatriation flights. As it stands, the government is not planning any more assisted flights but would “keep defence assets and RAAF planes in the region as a contingency as things develop in case there is a greater need”. “We feel that we have met the time for Australians to leave and the other point that obviously we've all been making isthat this is a very volatile and changeable environment,” he said. “Obviously, we don't know whether the Israeli air space will remain open and getting into Tel Aviv airport. It needs to remain open. There are a lot of variables which is why we were keen to get people out whenthere was an opportunity to do so.” At home, questions are turning to how Australia responds to the unfolding humanitarian crisis. The government and the opposition have maintained that Israel has a right to defend itself but some, including Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong, have called for Israel to show some “restraint” and prioritise the safety of civilians. The Coalition’s foreign affairs spokesman Simon Birmingham, without using the word “restraint”, said he hoped Israel “has regard for civilian life”. “We would hope that Israel has regard for civilian life and I think it’s important to note that Israel has shown regard for civilian life to date, that Israel has provided warnings in relation to regions being targeted by air strikes,” he told ABC Radio. “It’s provided those warnings in advance so that people can move and evacuate.” As it stands, many of the Gazans who have fled south have been killed by air strikes. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

‘Many threats’: Pink’s shock statement,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/tours/pink-releases-controversial-statement-after-receiving-many-threats/news-story/fbf3468a68f19b93c8bfe144f8eff27c,"Pink has released a statement to fans after being mistakenly dragged into the heated conversations surrounding the war between Israel and Hamas. In a post shared on X – formerly Twitter – on Sunday night, the Grammy Award-winning pop star, 44, explained that she’d been using the Māori “poi flags” in her shows for months. They’re blue and white – the same colours as Israel’s flag – which sparked the backlash as many believed it was a show of support for the country in its war against Hamas. “At this point, breathing is controversial. I am getting many threats because people mistakenly believe I am flying Israeli flags in my show. I am not,” Pink (real name Alecia Moore) said. “I have been using Poi flags since the beginning of this tour. These were used many, many years ago by the Māori people in New Zealand and because they and the Māori people are beautiful to me, we use them,” she explained, adding that, “I do not fly flags in my show in support of anything or anyone except the rainbow flag. That will remain my position.” She finished up by declaring: “I am human. I believe in peace. Equality. Love. I am deeply saddened by the state of the world. I pray for all of us.” Pink recently wrapped up her 41-date stadium tour. Her statement came after fans at one of her shows posted footage showing her backup dancers waving blue and white flags behind her. The Israeli government’s official Twitter account responded to the images, publicly thanking Pink for her apparent support of their country amid their conflict with Hamas. It comes amid fears of an all-out war as Israeli troops arepreparing for a ground invasion, seeking vengeance for a surprise offensive by Hamas on October 7. The Hamas attack saw fighters shoot, stab and burn to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. Israel’s reprisal attacks in the days since have flattened neighbourhoods and killed at least 2,670 people in Gaza, the majority ordinary Palestinians. Meanwhile, more than one million people have now fled their homes in Gaza in scenes of chaos and despair as Israel bombarded the Hamas-ruled territory and continued massing troops today in preparation for a full-blown ground invasion. In the wake of the fresh wave of violence, celebrities including Natalie Portman, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld, Gal Gadot and Amy Schumer have shared their support for Israel on social media. Jamie Lee Curtis was also among the high-profile Israel supporters, but wasforced to delete her messageafter being called out for an embarrassing oversight. Among the Oscar-winning actress’ flurry of posts about the conflict was an image of terrified children staring at missiles in the sky, which she shared alongside an Israel flag. “Terror from the skies,” she wrote, in a bid to encourage support for the Middle Eastern country. However, the photographer behind the image, Samar Abu Elouf, quickly clarified that it actually showed Palestinian children in Gaza in the photo, who could be seen running from bombs being counter-launched by Israel. Meanwhile, half-Palestinianmodel Gigi Hadid, who has been a longtime advocate for the ‘Free Palestine’ movement alongside her sister Bella Hadid, described the ongoing devastation in the region as an “unjustifiable tragedy”, and threw her support behind Palestine’s struggle while also condemning the violence that had arisen as a result of the attacks. “I have deep empathy for the Palestinian struggle and life under occupation, it’s a responsibility I hold daily,” she wrote last week. “I also feel a responsibility to my Jewish friends to make it clear, as I have before: While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person. “The terrorising of innocent people is not in alignment with and does not do any good for the ‘Free Palestine’ movement. “The idea that it does has fuelled a painful, decades-long cycle of back and forth retaliation (which no innocent civilian, Palestinian or Israeli, deserves to be a casualty of) and helps perpetuate the false idea that being Pro-Palestine = antisemitic.” A brutal crowd snap during a US rock band’s infamously disastrous Melbourne gig reveals the exact moment everything went wrong. The Brian Jonestown Massacre have been widely panned for their violent onstage antics, but new footage has revealed a twist. The lead singer of Suede charged into the crowd and was seen ripping phones from the hands of shocked concert-goers.",

Egypt’s Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry, put the blame on the Israeli government for not opening the Rafah crossing in remarks made on Monday. He also called the situation in Gaza “dangerous”. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden has said any move by Israel to occupy the Gaza Strip again would be a “big mistake”. It comes as Israeli troops prepare for a ground invasion as they seek vengeance for an attack by Hamas on October 7, which killed 1,300 people. Israel has warned more than a million people in northern Gaza to move south ahead of the operation. Scroll down for more live updates. Israeli family of five found dead in an embrace Harrowing accounts continued to emerge about the unprecedented attack by Hamas terrorists on Israel, including a couple who were killed three days before their planned engagement — and a family of five whose bodies were found in a tragic embrace. Aviv Kutz, 54, was found embracing his wife, Livnat, 49, daughter, Rotem, 19, and sons Yonatan, 17, and Yiftach, 17, as they lay dead in a bed at their Kfar Aza home on Oct. 7, the day the terrorists invaded Israel, according to the Times of Israel. “On the day they were murdered, we were supposed to visit them,” the children’s aunt, Adi Levy Salama, said of the family that had returned to Israel after living in Boston for several years. “Aviv organised an annual kite festival along the fence with Gaza to show them that we just want to live in peace,” Ms Salama told the outlet. Livnat, a graphic designer who was about to turn 50, was born during the Yom Kippur War — the 1973 conflict that has been compared to the current crisis in terms of Israel’s intelligence failure. Her husband was deputy director of a consulting firm and also worked in agriculture, the Times of Israel reported. Rotem was an IDF soldier who trained new recruits, while Yonatan and Yiftach attended the Kfar Hayarok boarding school in Ramat Hasharon near Tel Aviv and played basketball in the Hapoel youth program. “They were all amazing kids with huge hearts. They had their whole lives ahead of them,” their heartbroken aunt said. ‘They’re here’ The lives of another couple from Kfar Aza — IDF officers Niral Zini, 31, and his girlfriend, Niv Raviv, 27 — were cut short right before their planned engagement, Ynet reported. Mr Zini planned to propose to Ms Raviv on October 10, but the ring he planned to present to her was found in the burned house at the kibbutz, according to the outlet. On the day of the invasion, Mr Zini sent his family the message: “They’re here. I’m putting the phone down — pray.” He grasped a knife as he held the door to the shelter while Raviv hid under a bed, according to the outlet. The couple remained missing until Friday, when the family received the shattering news that their bodies had been found after the massacre. Mr Zini and Ms Raviv were both in the military reserves — he a major and she a captain. On Oct. 10, 2015, Zini was injured during an operational activity in Hebron — and the couple celebrated his survival with a special meal on the same date ever since, according to the outlet. He planned to begin studying law to help soldiers who were physically and mentally injured. Raviv was studying to become a clinical psychologist. Putin calls Israeli PM Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday called Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time since the deadly Hamas attack, and briefed him on several talks with leaders from the region and Palestinian Authority. “The Israeli side was in particular informed of the essential points of telephone correspondences that took place today with the leaders of Palestine, Egypt, Iran and Syria,” the Kremlin said in a statement. According to Moscow, the discussion focused on “the crisis situation resulting from the brutal escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict”. Putin expressed “his sincere condolences to the families and friends of the deceased Israelis,” the Kremlin said. He also told the Israeli president of the steps Russia has taken to “promote the normalisation of the situation, prevent a further escalation of violence and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.” Putin spoke in telephone calls with the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas. The Russian leader also told Netanyahu that Russia had a “fundamental desire to continue its targeted action aimed at ending” the conflict and finding “a peaceful settlement through political and diplomatic means,” according to the government’s statement. Moscow has traditionally maintained good relations with both Israeli and Palestinian authorities, as well as several regional players such as Syria, Egypt and Iran. Cardinal representing Pope Francis offers himself to Hamas Pope Francis’ top representative in the Middle East said Monday he was willing to trade places with Israeli children taken hostage by Hamas terrorists. Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 58, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, proposed the swap in response to a question during a video conference with journalists in Italy. “I am ready for an exchange, anything, if this can lead to freedom, to bring the children home. No problem. There is total willingness on my part,” he said. “The first thing to do is to try to win the release of the hostages, otherwise there will be no way of stopping [an escalation]. We are willing to help, even me personally,” the monsignor continued. Mr Pizzaballa noted, however, that he and his office had not yet had any direct communication with Hamas since the horror attack of Israel on Oct. 7 that killed at least 1,300 people. “You can’t talk to Hamas. It is very difficult,” he said. At least 199 people were taken hostage, including many children. On Friday, Hamas released disturbing footage that showed armed men cradling kidnapped Israeli babies and toddlers. Mr Pizzaballa oversees Roman Catholic activities in Israel and the Palestinian territories as well as Jordan and Cyprus, a region that is home to some 300,000 Roman Catholics. Iran says Hamas ready to release hostages if Israel stops air strikes Iran tried to pressure Israel into ending its revenge air strikes on Gaza by claiming Monday that the Hamas terrorists long sponsored by Tehran would be willing to free the 199 hostages now known to have been taken during the slaughter of more than 1,400 people. Iranian Foreign Ministry Nasser Kanaani claimed that Hamas is “ready” to release the hostages, but doing so would be “impossible” under Israeli air strikes in the region. He claimed that the terror group “stated that they are ready to take necessary measures to release the citizens and civilians held by resistant groups, but their point was that such measures require preparations that are impossible under daily bombardment by the Zionists against various parts of Gaza,” Mr Kanaani said. Despite this, Hamas has yet to make such an offer publicly. The terror group did, however, speak out Monday to maintain that its unprecedented October 7 attack was a solo effort not driven by Iran, despite widespread belief among Israeli and Western officials. The war in Gaza is “a Palestinian battle and the decision to enter it was a Palestinian decision” made by Hamas and its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al Qassam Brigades, “together with the Palestinian resistance factions,” according to Hamas’ rep in Lebanon, Ahmed Abdul-Hadi. Although no government worldwide has offered direct evidence to support the widely held belief that Iran orchestrated the attack, Tehran has long sponsored Hamas, including training, funding and providing it with weapons. Netanyahu denounces ‘evil axis’ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has addressed the Knesset, which is his country’s equivalent to our parliament. “There are many questions surrounding the disaster that befell us ten days ago. We will investigate every aspect thoroughly,” Mr Netanyahu said. “The nation is united towards one goal: victory. We will triumph because it’s about our very existence in this region, which is fraught with dark forces. “Hamas is part of the evil axis of Iran and Hezbollah. They aim to plunge the Middle East into an abyss of chaos. “Many around the world understand who Israel is facing. They comprehend that Hamas represents a new version of Nazism. Just as the world united to defeat the Nazis and ISIS, so it must unite to defeat Hamas.” Israeli ambassador says there’s ‘no humanitarian crisis’ Israel’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, Tzipi Hotovely, was interviewed on Britain’s Sky News on Monday morning, where she was asked for her position on the “humanitarian crisis” unfolding in the Gaza Strip. “There is no humanitarian crisis,” Ms Hotovely responded. “There isn’t?” interjected host Kay Burley, who was taken aback. “There is no (crisis),” said the ambassador. “Israel is in charge of the safety of the Israelis. Hamas is in charge of the safety of the Palestinians.” Burley countered that her channel had been “showing pictures that would indicate there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza”. “Can I ask you something? Are you a mother?” said Ms Hotovely. Burley answered in the affirmative. “What would you think if your children would have been executed in front of your eyes? Would you expect your government to think about those Nazis committing those crimes? And to think, ‘First of all, we need to think about protecting the enemy, and then to protect my children.’ Your children come as the priority to your prime minister.” “We have been showing images this morning that show there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” Burley repeated. “So blame Hamas. And ask Hamas why they started those atrocities,” said the ambassador. “So you’re acknowledging there is a humanitarian crisis?” Burley asked. “I’m saying there is no (crisis),” said Ms Hotovely. “So what is happening?” said Burley. “What is happening is that there’s a war in Gaza, a war that Hamas started by committing a horrible massacre of Israelis. “Those people committed crimes that are worse than ISIS. “Israel is better than any other army in the world. We are alerting, we are giving them an opportunity to take shelter. We are doing things that no other Western army did in the past.” Horrifying footage shows Hamas killing female soldiers Extremely confronting footage which allegedly shows Hamas terrorists murdering injured female soldiers has been posted by an Israeli Telegram channel. “These videos were incredibly difficult to post. But we feel the world must know about the brutality of the terrorists who attacked Israel,” the channel, South First Responders, said. The footage, recovered from one of the militants’ head cameras, showed the Hamas fighters inside a border posts, occupied by young, wounded Israeli Defence Force recruits. Having thrown a grenade into the room, the militants shoot the Israeli women dead. One of the ADF recruits is heard screaming before she is shot. “The conscripts are hiding under a table covering their heads,” said South First Responders. “Rather than take the soldiers prisoner, as would be required by international law, the terrorist moves a chair aside to fire at point blank range and execute them. “It doesn’t end here. The terrorists fire again. Amid the last gasps of the conscripts, the terrorists fire a final kill shot to execute them. “Hamas terrorists carried out intentional executions of injured soldiers in direct violation of basic international law.” We are choosing not to show the footage and some of the graphic images. Aussie erects ‘death to Israel’ sign near primary school Masoud Rahmani, 31, posted a sign outside his Adelaide home which read: “You don’t need to be Muslim to stand up for Gaza. You just need to be human. Death to Israel and it’s (sic) allies.” His home is 100m from a primary school. Mr Rahmani, who grew up in Afghanistan, told theAdvertiser: “As an Australian I feel ashamed. In Gaza and Palestine, people are getting killed on a daily basis. “I’m Afghan, I grew up in Afghanistan, I’ve been through terrorist attacks, I know how it feels to not be able to live and get out of the house and saying goodbye to your family not knowing if you’ll come back tonight. “Innocent people shouldn’t be killed, but years and years of pushing them back into the corner – they’ll just lose it.” He later conceded that he had gone to far with the words “death to Israel” and removed it. Message of hope after raver‘s slaughter Friends of a 23-year-old woman who was killed in a kibbutz have vowed to rebuild the community as a symbol of the strength of “peace and love” in the face of terror. Dorin Atias was originally scheduled to work as a bartender at the Supernova festival and arrived early to enjoy some dancing before her shift. But when rockets started flying overhead at around 6am, she immediately sensed danger. She grabbed two friends and drove to a nearby kibbutz in Re’im, where they believed they could find shelter or a bunker. Tragically, her and her friend Leo were killed, while one friend named Eden remains missing. Friends of Dorin are determined to take a stand as the next generation of Israelis and continue living for those who have died. They believe that they must protect their land and the precious souls of everyone, stressing the importance of choosing peace and love in the face of darkness and violence. “As twenty-somethings here … as Israel goes to war, it teaches you something: you have to move on, you have to keep alive for everyone who has died,” a friend named Saban said. Scores of foreigners killed in the conflict According to an AFP count of the conflict’s mounting toll, more than 160 foreigners have been confirmed dead by their national authorities. Many of them also held Israeli nationality. The list includes 30 Americans, 28 Thai citizens, 19 French nationals, 16 Russians, 10 Nepali citizens, seven Argentinians, seven Ukrainians, five Canadians, and smaller numbers from dozens of other countries. In addition to the dead, an unknown number of foreigners were abducted by Hamas. Egypt blames Israel as border crossing stays shut Egypt says it wants to open the only crossing along its border with the Gaza Strip to allow civilians to escape, but Israel has not allowed it. The country’s Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry, put the blame on the Israeli government in remarks on Monday. He also called the situation in Gaza “dangerous”. Meanwhile the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, has called for an immediate end to all military operations in Gaza. “We demand the immediate end of military operations and the opening of safe corridors to bring aid to the population,” he said. The Arab League has 22 members, spread across the Middle East and northern Africa. 199 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza Israel Defence Force has revealed 199 people are still being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, revising up an earlier number of 155 given yesterday. Spokesman Daniel Hagari said the military has “updated the families” of all hostages. Israel plans bloody end for Hamas Tzipi Hotovely, Israel’s ambassador to the UK, has declared his country will wipe Hamas from the region after the terrorist organisation’s open act of war. “This is war that Hamas started, and Israel will finish,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live. “Every Israeli is traumatised by the Hamas massacre in innocent people. As the days go by, the atrocities are exposed,” “We heard that 80% of the bodies were tortured, young women being raped, young babies being beheaded, those kind of atrocities, barbarism – pure evil the world hasn‘t seen since World War Two. “Hamas won‘t exist in the Gaza Strip. Israel cannot afford a terror organisation in its borders.” Fears of all-out war grow More than one million people have now fled their homes in Gaza in scenes of chaos and despair as Israel bombarded the Hamas-ruled territory and continued massing troops today in preparation for a full-blown ground invasion. The move has sparked fears of an all-out war erupting in the region as Israel today evacuated civilians living in villages close to the border with Lebanon after the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah vowed to ‘respond’ to any move to invade Gaza. Israeli authorities issued the order to residents living within two kilometres of the Israeli-Lebanese border as Israel fears a reactionary attack from Hezbollah. The Israeli army Monday noted in a statement “the implementation of a plan to evacuate residents of northern Israel who live in the area up to two kilometres from the Lebanese border to state-funded guesthouses”. The move affects thousands of people living in 28 communities. Many have already left the area after repeated cross-border fire in recent days has claimed lives on both sides of the UN-patrolled border between Lebanon and Israel which remain technically at war. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said his country had “no interest in a war in the north, we don’t want to escalate the situation”. “If Hezbollah chooses the path of war, it will pay a very heavy price,” he said on Sunday. “But if it restrains itself, we’ll respect the situation and keep things the way they are”. Aussie news crew rushes to bomb shelter A Channel 7 crew has been caught in a tense moment near the Gaza border after a warning siren started blaring midway through a live broadcast. Barely three minutes into his report, 7NEWS Chief Reporter Chris Reason and his crew had to be rushed into a nearby bomb shelter as blasts could be heard outside the frame. After about a minute, the crew briefly stepped out of the shelter, but then returned inside because there were indications of further attacks. “I don’t know if you can still hear us,” Reason said. “We’re obviously inside the shelter across the road where we deliberately set up in case that sort of thing happened. “Our producer on the ground here is saying that the indications are that something might still be about to happen, that we’re not clear yet, so we’ll stay inside this concrete bunker.” Palestine President’s Hamas comment censored President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority made comments criticising Hamas during a phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. However the comments, originally published by the Palestinian Authority‘s official news agency (WAFA), were later suspiciously redacted to remove the reference to the terrorist organisation. The original statement emphasised that Hamas’ policies and actions “do not represent the Palestinian people”, with the PLO being the sole legitimate representative. The revised statement instead stressed that the policies, programs, and decisions of the PLO represent the Palestinian people as their sole legitimate representative, without mentioning any specific organisation. It is unclear why the reference to Hamas was removed, and there were no immediate comments from Abbas‘ office, WAFA, or Hamas. President Abbas has a longstanding opposition to Hamas, which controls Gaza and ousted Fatah party forces loyal to Abbas in 2007. Reconciliation talks between the two factions have so far been unsuccessful. Biden says Palestine still needs an authority When asked if Hamas — whom Biden described as “a bunch of cowards” — must be eliminated entirely, he replied: “Yes I do.” “But there needs to be a Palestinian authority. “There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state,” he continued, reiterating the longstanding US call for a two-state solution. 60 Minutesjournalist Scott Pelley also asked Biden if he could foresee US troops joining the war. “I don’t think that’s necessary,” Biden, who pulled US troops out of Afghanistan and has insisted that none will be sent to aid Ukraine as it holds off a Russian invasion, replied. The US has already deployed two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean in a powerful show of support for Israel. Door-to-door arrests As the conflict continues, ex-senior diplomat and security adviser to the Israeli Government, Nimrod Novik, said some military and political leaders want Israeli troops to undertake an 18 month-long operation of door-to-door arrests in Gaza. “Others, I think, are far more sober and not talking about demolishing Hamas, but rather depriving Hamas of their ability to threaten us,” he said. Meanwhile, Golan Vach, the colonel of the Israel National Search and Rescue Unit said Hamas and their supporters “must die”. “Not only have I seen a baby beheaded by Hamas, I held it in my hands,” he toldThe Sun. “We must wipe this evil off the face of the earth, once and for all.” The Hamas attack saw fighters shoot, stab and burn to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. Israel’s reprisal attacks in the days since have flattened neighbourhoods and killed at least 2,670 people in Gaza, the majority ordinary Palestinians. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally. Hundreds of school students ignored warnings from politicians and principals to attend a pro-Palestine rally.",
‘Occupiers’: Lidia’s furious spray on Israel war,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/pm-condemns-israel-slaughter-as-leaders-disagree-over-growing-war-crisis-in-middleeast/news-story/4df5030e763e9f32267e473bdb955e3b,"Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe has worn a Palestinian keffiyeh to the Senate chamber while arguing that Australia had sided with an “oppressive occupation.” In the first parliamentary sittings since terrorist attacks by Hamas militants in Israel on October 7, Australia’s leaders clashed over the nation’s response to escalating war conflict in Gaza. Senator Thorpe donned a keffiyeh, the scarf associated with Palestinian people, as she told the Senate she condemned the Hamas attacks on Israeli people. She said Palestinians “live with generational trauma of dispossession, they continue to fight for sovereignty, liberation and land back, as do First peoples of this country. “You have the responsibility to support Palestinians standing against it, just as you have the responsibility to support First Nations people here standing against it.” She condemned the violence Israel “is and has been inflicting on the Palestinian people since 1948.” “The core issue of this conflict is 75 years of violent displacement, time, segregation, humiliation and dehumanisation,’ she told the Senate. “Palestinians live with a generation of trauma, of oppression and dispossession, they continue to fight for sovereignty, liberation and their land back, as do first peoples of this country.” Israeli defence forces have continued to amass troops along the Gaza border, signalling a ground invasion on the highly-populated Palestinian territory in response to the Hamas attack. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has “unequivocally” condemned the Hamas action and said unfolding violence in Israel and Gaza had caused deep distress across the Australian community and called upon all leaders to maintain respect. Mr Albanese told Parliament said Jewish families were mourning the greatest loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. “We must face what has happened – and what is now unfolding – with complete moral clarity,” Mr Albanese said on Monday. “Hamas terrorists committed mass murder on a horrific scale. “This was no act of war against the army of an enemy. It was the slaughter of innocent people. It was an act of terror,” he said. “Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price. We should be very clear that it is Hamas that is the enemy, not the Palestinian people.” Mr Albanese said there was no place for hateful prejudice in Australia and rejected anti-Semitic chants made by a small group of protesters at rally outside of the Sydney Opera House last week. Alluding to criticisms from the opposition over language used to condemn Hamas, the prime minister urged for a respectful discussion. “The message we should be sending loudly and clearly from this place to all Australians is to avoid the traps set by such forces of division. Anyone seeking to exploit the people suffering for political purposes should consider the damage,” the prime minister said. “As people express their views, and condemns all forms of hate speech and violent extremist activity, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and recognises an attack on any religion is an attack on all religions, and that we all share a responsibility to unite, condemn and defeat such an attack on our common values and way of life.”  Opposition leader Peter Dutton said the October 7 attacks by Hamas were a “total act of sheer barbarity” and said there should be no restraint shown to terrorists. “What occurred nine days ago, was the embodiment of evil and the abhorrent acts of masses inhumanity have been evident for the world to see,” Mr Dutton said. “Like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Hamas invasion of Israel was unprovoked, it was unjust and it was absolutely unacceptable.” Following Hamas’ assault, hundreds of Palestine supporters marched through Sydney in protest against the Opera House being lit up in blue and white in support of Israel. After condemning anti-Jewish sentiments, Mr Dutton pointed to the prime minister and said “the Jewish community here in Australia deserves to hear you condemn them as well.” “Shame on you for condoning those words,” he said. Both Mr Albanese and Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong publicly denounced some of the behaviour seen at last week’s protest, with Mr Albanese telling Sky News on October 10 that the images from the rally were “horrific” and “appalling.” Greens leader Adam Bandt called on the government to firmly oppose a looming ground invasion by Israeli forces in Gaza. He moved to amend a motion supporting Israel’s right to defend itself, and to replace it with a point which explicitly “condemns war crimes perpetrated by the state of Israel, including the bombing of Palestinian civilians.” “We join with everyone in this place to say there is no place to anti Semitism and Islamophobia. There is much that we could support but on the eve of a looming invasion, that is likely to be not just a humanitarian catastrophe, but a war crime. Australia cannot stay silent,” Mr Bandt said. Following a debate in the House of Representatives leaders overwhelmingly voted to support a motion condemning Hamas’ attacks, with the Greens’ attempt to amend language expressing support for Israeli counter attacks unsuccessful.  A landmark green energy scheme to keep the lights on as ageing coal fired power generation exits the grid has been unveiled, but the government reveal how much the scheme will cost. Labor has been slammed for being “out of date” on nuclear energy and having an “obsession” with renewables, just days away from a major climate conference in the Middle East. A major change is coming for dual citizens convicted of terrorism with the government vowing to fix “broken” laws.",
Chilling Hamas end-game for Israel,https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/experts-predict-terror-group-hamas-terrifying-end-game/news-story/f46c8ab3f36cb0e4c2c0b8f0ee852698,"As the conflict in Israel shows no signs of abating — one expert has spectacularly claimed that Hamas’ attack has been a “success” for the terror group for one chilling reason. The conflict has left more than 1,400 dead in Israel while Gaza Strip health authorities have reported that more than 2,600 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes. Despite a growing Palestinian death toll and Hamas’ goal of destroying Israel seemingly slipping further away, it doesn’t mean its recent attack will be considered a failure by the terror group. National security lecturer at Charles Sturt University Dr Levi West described Hamas’s strategy as one of “provocation”. “Terrorist groups frequently use this strategy where they undertake a form of highly calibrated and choreographed violence, designed to provoke their adversary into reacting in a manner that is driven by emotion, rage and vengeance, rather than undertaking considered, strategic, and calculated responses,” he told news.com.au. He said what has transpired from Israel is a “positive for Hamas from a recruitment and radicalisation perspective”. “Every time Israel undertakes a counter measure, especially kinetic counter measures such as air strikes, the more civilian Palestinian are likely to want to either sympathise with Hamas, or to even seek avenues for participation, be that within Gaza, or well beyond, as witnessed by the increasingly tense and fractious protests and counter protests across the world,” he said. Desperation behind attack Other experts suggest desperation is a key factor behind the attack — as the possibility of a sovereign Palestine becomes increasingly unlikely. Dr Martin Kear from Sydney University told news.com.au the “scale and ferocity” of the attack was a reflection of the “anger, frustration and desperation” many Palestinians fear. “From the Palestinian perspective there’s a desperation and a very real possibility, and perhaps inevitability, of there never being a sovereign Palestine,” he said. “So what would become of the Palestinian nation? What is left but to do something spectacular to highlight their desperation?” He added that the “perilous” humanitarian situation in Gaza was also provoking rage. Others have predicted the Palestinian terror group Hamas won’t stop until they have completely annihilated the Jewish state. Dr Ran Porat from the Australian Centre for Jewish Civilization at Monash University told news.com.au Hamas’ original covenant from 1988 is “similar to other Jihadist movements such as ISIS and al-Qaeda”. “The ultimate goal is the spreading of Islam in the world until a new Islamic empire (Caliphate) is reinstated”, he said. “Specifically, they reject all compromise with ‘the Zionist entity’ and aim for its destruction”. Dr Porat described the “end game” of Hamas as the “annihilation of the Jewish State”. “The Iranian regime has the same stated goal,” he said. The expert decried Hamas and Iran as well as “radical national Jews“ who reject any compromise. “It would take a real shift in the frame of mind of the leaders in the region away from a zero-sum game mentality for peace to be achieved”, Dr Porat said lamenting there was “no Palestinian Nelson Mandela or Gandhi” to lead the way. Horror scenes as one million flee More than one million people have fled their homes in Gaza in scenes of chaos and despair as Israel bombarded the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip and continued amassing troops Monday in preparation for a full-blown ground invasion. Israel declared war on the Islamist group a day after waves of its fighters broke through the heavily fortified border on October 7, shooting, stabbing and burning to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. Israel then unleashed a relentless bombing campaign of Gaza that has flattened neighbourhoods and left at least 2,670 people dead in the territory, mainly civilians. Palestinians carrying whatever belongings they can, in bags and suitcases, or packed onto three-wheeled motorbikes, battered cars, vans and even donkey carts have become a common sight. Fleeing the bombardment and following an Israeli order to move to the south of the Gaza Strip, people have had to find shelter wherever they can, including on the streets and in UN-run schools. “No electricity, no water, no internet. I feel like I’m losing my humanity,” said Mona Abdel Hamid, 55, who fled Gaza City to Rafah in the south of the enclave, and is having to stay with strangers. US President Joe Biden said in an interview with the CBS news programme 60 Minutes that while invading and “taking out the extremists” was needed, any move to occupy the territory would be a “big mistake”. ‘Verge of abyss’ A bereaved and infuriated Israel has massed forces outside the long-blockaded enclave of 2.4 million in preparation for what the army has said would be a land, air and sea attack involving a “significant ground operation”. Hamas backer Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which is also supported by Tehran, have warned that an invasion would be met with a response. “No one can guarantee the control of the situation and the non-expansion of the conflicts” if Israel sends its soldiers into Gaza, said Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. Fire along the Israeli-Lebanese border has intensified in the last week, prompting Israel to shutter the area to civilians. On Sunday, a rocket hit the UN peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah attacks killed one person in Israel, the Israeli military said. More than 10 people have been killed in Lebanon and at least two in Israel in the past week. Among those killed in Lebanon was a Reuters journalist, Issam Abdallah. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due back in Israel on Monday after a crisis tour of Middle Eastern countries in a frantic attempt to avert a wider crisis in the volatile region. But as Israel seeks to avenge the worst attack in its history, the Arab League and African Union warned the invasion could lead to “a genocide of unprecedented proportions”. UN chief Antonio Guterres has warned that the entire region was “on the verge of the abyss”. Escalation risk Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said his country had “no interest in a war in the north, we don’t want to escalate the situation”. The United States, which has given unequivocal backing to Israel, has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean as a deterrent. The White House has voiced fears at the prospect of Iran becoming “directly engaged”, after it praised the Hamas attack but insisted it was not involved. But asked in the 60 Minutes interview whether US troops might join the war, Biden said “I don’t think that’s necessary”. “Israel has one of the finest fighting forces in the country. I guarantee we’re gonna provide them everything they need,” he said. The United States has also appealed to China to use its influence in the region to ease tensions. On Sunday Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Israel’s response had “gone beyond the scope of self-defence”, and demanded that it “cease its collective punishment of the people of Gaza”. Aid agencies’ alarm Massing thousands of troops and heavy weaponry in the desert south of the country, the Israeli military has said it is awaiting the “political” green light to go into northern Gaza. The army has told 1.1 million Palestinians in the north of the Gaza Strip to head to the south of the enclave. But Israeli air strikes were continuing in the south, including in Khan Yunis and Rafah, where one resident said a doctor’s house was targeted. “All the family was wiped out,” said Khamis Abu Hilal. The UN said Monday that 47 entire families, amounting to around 500 people, have been wiped out in Israel’s bombing campaign. Foreign governments and aid agencies, including the UN and Red Cross, have repeatedly criticised Israel’s evacuation order. The UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees said Sunday that some one million Palestinians had already been displaced in the first week of the conflict -- but the number was likely to be higher. Lynn Hastings, the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, decried that Israel was connecting humanitarian aid into Gaza with the release of scores of hostages seized during the Hamas attack. “Neither should be conditional,” she insisted in a video posted by the UN. “They have said they want to destroy Hamas, but their current trajectory is going to destroy Gaza.” Evacuations In Gaza, hospitals are becoming overwhelmed with increasing numbers of dead and injured. Health officials on Sunday said some 9,600 people have been wounded. Israeli energy minister Israel Katz on Sunday said water supplies to southern Gaza had been switched back on. But power outages threaten to cripple life-support systems, from sea water desalination plants to food refrigeration and hospital incubators. Even everyday functions -- from going to the toilet, showering and washing clothes -- are almost impossible, locals said. Gazans are effectively trapped, with Israeli-controlled crossings closed and Egypt also having shut the Rafah border in the south. Blinken said he was confident the crossing “will be open” for aid into the strip, amid reports that Egypt was blocking the passage of Gazans with foreign passports until relief supplies are allowed in. He categorically rejected the idea floated of expelling Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. Hostages The mood in Israel has swung between collective grief, fury and a strong desire to punish Hamas, which Netanyahu has likened to the Islamic State group. It is proscribed as a terrorist group by several Western governments, including the United States. There are deep fears about the safety of 155 hostages that Hamas has taken to the Gaza Strip. “We must bring them back home alive,” said a tearful Yrat Zailer, the aunt of children aged nine months and four years whom Hamas abducted along with their mother. Israel said last week it had found the bodies of 1,500 Islamist militants in southern towns near the Palestinian enclave recaptured by the army. Planeloads of Israelis have returned from around the world to join the latest of the many wars in their country’s 75-year history. — with AFP To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout “Risky behaviours” by China towards Australia could be pointing to a dangerous escalation which could blow up any moment.

Moving moment before repatriation flight,https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/aussie-aussie-aussie-second-repatriation-flight-leaves-tel-aviv/news-story/2876313222ece6ebdc2ac126e7df401b,"Visibly relieved passengers have shared an emotional moment, led by a pastor, as they boarded the second repatriation flight to leave Israel for Australia. The crowd of passengers was led in an enthusiastic chant of “Aussie, Aussie Aussie – Oi, Oi, Oi” as they waited at Tel Aviv airport. This comes after two repatriation flights were cancelled over the weekend due to “rapidly changing” conditions in the region. The passenger who led the chant took the moment to publicly thank the government for its support of Australians in the war-affected region. “A number of you have said it, I think we should really be giving a thanks to our government,” he said to a resounding cheer from the other passengers. “I thought before we go we should say a blessing from Australia on this land of Israel.” The man, who identified as a pastor, then led the crowd in a prayer, blessing the people of both Israel and Gaza. “Father, we thank you for … the plane that has been provided by our government … and as we leave this land we want to pray for the people of this land, both the Jew and the Arab,” he said. “We want to pray that you would be the protector of Israel … and that you would give your grace and your protection over all their families and over all their soldiers and over all their children. “Father, we pray for the people in Gaza as well, we think of all of those who are traumatised because of what Hamas has been doing, and they are just the victims of this as war comes into their homes and upon their people.’ “We ask … to bring peace to this land so they can live together under the Prince of Peace Yeshua (Jesus).” Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong confirmed on Monday that three repatriation flights carrying hundreds of Australians left Tel Aviv airport for Dubai overnight. About 1200 Australians – some 250 of whom boarded two RAAF planes and one private contracted flight on Sunday night – have now been assisted in leaving Israel since Hamas’ attack on October 7. “We are still working on seeking to assist those Australians who are currently in Gaza,” Senator Wong said. “This is a very difficult situation, a very frightening situation and we are working with international partners, including the US and Egypt and Israel, to try and ensure safe passage for Australians. “As yet, as people would know, the situation in Gaza is extremely difficult.” On Sunday, the federal government issued a grave warning to Australians in Lebanon, which shares a northern border with Israel. According to Reuters, Israeli military and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah have been trading fire since Friday when an Israeli shelling reportedly struck a Lebanese army observation post. “If you are in Lebanon, you should consider whether your need to remain there is essential,” Senator Wong said. Smartraveller cautioned Australians to “consider the first available option” out of the country. “If you wish to leave, a crisis could limit commercial options for departure,” Smartraveller posted to social media. Senator Wong has also urged Australians remaining in Israel who still wish to leave to do so now. An Aussie couple who survived a horrific bus crash in Peru and were left stranded for weeks have revealed their “ordeal” trying to get home. A woman has shared the shocking reason why she never saw a former colleague again after heading on an overseas trip together.

Man ‘kills 6yo Muslim boy over Israel war’,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/us-man-stabbed-6yearold-muslim-boy-26-times-in-hate-crime-motivated-by-israelhamas-war-police/news-story/ea5c668f518a94df8f4a8c4a9d4e2747,"A 71-year-old landlord killed a six-year-old boy and wounded his mother because of their Muslim faith and in response to the war between Israel and Hamas, police say. Will County sheriff’s deputies responded to a call in Plainfield Township, Ill., late Saturday morning and found suspect Joseph Czuba sitting in front of a home near South Lincoln Highway and Lily Cache Road. Czuba was bloodied from a cut on his forehead, and inside the home, police discovered the body of little Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian-American boy who had recently celebrated his sixth birthday. The boy suffered 26 stab wounds from a large military-style knife, according to the autopsy, while his mother, Hanaan Shahin, 32, survived being stabbed more than a dozen times. Czuba allegedly shouted, “You Muslims must die!” at the family ahead of the stabbing, according to text messages sent to the boy’s father. “Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,” the Will County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Officials said the victims were rushed to the hospital, with Al-Fayoume declared dead and Shahin in critical condition but expected to survive. The mother and son had lived on the ground floor of Czuba’s home for about two years, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Chicago chapter, who condemned the violence. CAIR-Chicago described the stabbings as the Muslim community’s “worst nightmare,” calling it part of a disturbing spike in hate crimes targeting them after Hamas’ attack on Israel and the Jewish State’s subsequent declaration of war. The group said the landlord “had been angry with what he was seeing in the news” and went to knock on the family’s door. When Shahin opened the door, he allegedly attempted to choke her and then went on to stab her and her boy with a knife, CAIR said. “What we have is a murdered Palestinian child, created by the radicalization,” said CAIR president Ahmed Rehab. Czuba was taken into custody at the scene and transported to a hospital to treat the cut on his forehead, police said. He was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crimes and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Czuba is currently being held at the Will County’s Adult Detention facility. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

‘Kill you’: Haunting words in YouTuber’s chat,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/i-wish-idf-kills-more-children-palestinian-gamers-disturbing-chat-with-israeli-soldier/news-story/a225013048de337375968afa849877b1,"A man claiming to be an Israeli soldier online has made disturbing allegations about killing innocent Palestinians, even saying he wants the nation’s defence force to ‘kill more children’ in a disturbing online chat with a popular US YouTuber. In a chilling TikTok video, 20-year-old gamer Hamzah, who goes by the online moniker Absorber, shared a conversation he had with two men claiming to be Israeli Defence Force (IDF) soldiers over the online chat service, OmeTV. In the video, Hamzah asked: “Didn’t the IDF … bomb Gaza?” “Yeah of course,” the man purporting to be a soldier responded. “And they killed hundreds of children?” Hamzah asked. “I don’t know about this,” the soldier replied. “I just know that we bombed them because they bombed us.” News.com.au has attempted to verify the alleged soldier’s identity, and is not suggesting his views represent the IDF or that of any Israeli soldier. TikTok has since removed the video, which under the social media giant’s rules can happen if a clip breaks certain user terms. When Hamzah began asking about the history of the conflict and suggesting Israel is occupying Palestinian territory, another man claiming to be a soldier interjected and started spewing extreme comments. “I wish IDF kills more children,” he said, as the first man broke out into laughter. “And I wish the IDF will find you and kill you okay,” he continued. “It’s only Israel no Palestine and if you talk [like that] again, I will f*** you in your a** okay.” In the clip, Hamzah proceeded to ask if the alleged soldier kills innocent Palestinians, to which he replied: “I kill every Palestinian I see.” “Every Palestinian I see, I…,” he continued, as he reached for his gun and the footage cut out. It’s the not first online conversation about the Israel-Hamas war that Hamzah has shared on TikTok. In a separate video, which has amassed over seven million views, the 20-year-old spoke to two girls who explained they were under attack. “[There are] 1,200 dead people in Israel,” they said. Hamzah responded saying “Didn’t Israel kill thousands of Palestinians since they started occupying Palestine in 1948 or is history just wrong?” One of the girls replied, saying “they tell lies about Israel’s army”. Hamzah then encouraged the girls to participate in a moment of silence for all the Palestinians killed as he smiled at the camera. More than 1,400 people have been killed in Israel after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched their surprise attack on the country on Saturday October 7. Gaza Strip health authorities have reported more than 2,600 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Thousands of civilians have been killed since Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an attack on Israeli citizens on October 7, and the subsequent retaliatory air strike launched by Israel. Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong confirmed on Monday morning two Australian air force flights and one charter flight – in total carrying more than 250 Australians as well as citizens from other countries – departed Israel overnight. “That means there‘s about 1200 Australians and families who have departed since this conflict began,” she told Today. However, as conditions in the war zone deteriorate, airlines are dropping out of crucial repatriation flights. “There were quite a lot of no-shows, flights who were recorded as saying they wanted to leave but did not show up,” Ms Wong said. “I have said to people if you wish to leave, leave now and don‘t wait for a flight.” She said – subject to security conditions – the Australian government has prepared one more flight due to depart Israel on Monday. More than one million Palestinians have been forced to flee their homes since Israel began bombing the northern Gaza Strip last week. “It is a much more complex and a very risky and difficult, and frightening situation for those Australians and their families,” Ms Wong said of people living on the Gaza Strip. “We are obviously engaging with the United States and Egypt to try and seek assistance for foreign nationals including Australians who want to leave but so far that has proved extremely difficult given the security situation on the ground.” Meanwhile in Australia, thousands attended rallies hosted right across the country to stand in solidarity with either Palestine or Israel. There was fear the rallies could attract a small contingent of protesters who have used the events to platform hate speech including a group caught on video chanting anti-Semitic slogans outside the Opera House last weekend. However, police said they had no need to use “extraordinary powers” despite about 6000 people gathering in Sydney on Sunday for peaceful pro-Palestine rallies. “This is a very difficult situation, it’s a situation where the Jewish community in Australia feel very strongly, as do the Palestinian community,” Ms Wong said. “And one of the things I have at pains to urge is for us to ensure that our views on this are dealt with respectfully. There is no place for antisemitism or Islamophobia. “People come to this nation because we’re a tolerant nation because we’re a tolerant nation, we respect one another, we deal with differences of views in respectful way.” A landmark green energy scheme to keep the lights on as ageing coal fired power generation exits the grid has been unveiled, but the government reveal how much the scheme will cost. Labor has been slammed for being “out of date” on nuclear energy and having an “obsession” with renewables, just days away from a major climate conference in the Middle East. A major change is coming for dual citizens convicted of terrorism with the government vowing to fix “broken” laws.",
Reason Israel’s invasion of Gaza delayed,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hamas-leader-who-plotted-deadly-attack-killed-israeli-forces-claim/news-story/0be2af18d4ae5f2c0fb51d5ebcc2ca55,"The Israeli military’s looming Gaza ground invasion aimed at destroying Palestinian militant group Hamas has reportedly been delayed due to bad weather. It comes after Israel warned 1.1 million Palestinian civilians to leave northern Gaza. The invasion has been delayed by “a few days at least in part because of weather conditions that would have made it harder for Israeli pilots and drone operators to provide ground forces with air cover”,The New York Timesreported, citing Israeli officers. Israeli troops preparing to invade Gaza Strip In a statement released just hours after its evacuation deadline for north Gaza expired – forcing hundreds of thousands of panicked civilians to flee south, without food or shelter – the Israel Defence Forces said it was preparing for the “next stages of war”. “With the support of an extensive logistical effort and hundreds of thousands of drafted reservists, IDF forces are currently preparing to implement a wide range of operational offensive plans, which can include combined and co-ordinated strikes from the air, sea and land,” the statement read. “IDF battalions and soldiers are deployed across the country and are increasing operational readiness for the next stages of war, with an emphasis on significant ground operations.” The IDF has swarmed the border of Gaza with troops and military equipment – but the exact contours of its plan for a siege remains unclear. No timings have been given for the attack. More than 2200 people have been killed in Israel’s bombing campaign of the region, Palestinian authorities say, in the aftermath of Hamas attack on Israel last weekend, in which more than 1300 people were killed. When Israel will commence ‘significant military operations’ A spokesperson for the IDF has toldCNNit will start “significant military operations” in Gaza “once we see that civilians have left the area”. “It’s really important that people in Gaza know we’ve been very, very generous with the time. We have given ample warning, more than 25 hours … I cannot stress more than enough to say now is the time for Gazans to leave,” Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said. “Take your belongings, go south. Preserve your life, and do not fall into the trap that Hamas is setting up for you.” He told the outlet the area around the Gaza Strip is densely packed with “hundreds of thousands of Israeli reserve units” that are preparing for various missions. “The challenge and the mission is to have all of those more than 360,000 reservists both in the south and in the north, get them mission ready, equipped, prepared, task-forced, and ready for any assignments they will have in the future.” Penny Wong’s message to Aussies in Lebanon The travel advice for Australians in Lebanon has changed, Foreign Minister Penny Wong has told reporters at a press conference in Adelaide. “The existing travel advice for Lebanon is reconsider your need to travel due to the security environment,” Senator Wong said. “I am now saying to Australians if you are in Lebanon, you should consider whether your need to remain there is essential. “If you wish to leave you should know that a crisis could limit commercial options for departure and you should consider the first available option.” 300 killed, 800 injured in 24 hours The Ministry of Health in Gaza reports some 300 people were killed, and 800 injured in the region in the 24 hours to Sunday morning local time. Most of the victims, the Ministry said, were women and children. Fears for innocent civilians continue to grow as Israel gears up for the “next stages” of its war with Hamas. Iran warns Israel could suffer ‘huge earthquake’ Iran’s mission to the United Nations has warned of “far-reaching consequences” if Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip do not stop “immediately”. “If the Israeli apartheid’s war crimes & genocide are not halted immediately, the situation could spiral out of control & ricochet far-reaching consequences – the responsibility of which lies with the UN, the Secretary Council & the states steering the Council toward a dead end,” the post onXread. It comes after Iran’s Foreign Minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, warned the war might expand to other parts of the Middle East if Hezbollah militants join the fight. Mr Amirabdollahian told reporters in Beirut that he knows “about the scenarios that Hezbollah has put in place”. “Any step the resistance (Hezbollah) will take will cause a huge earthquake in the Zionist entity. “I want to warn the war criminals and those who support this entity before it’s too late to stop the crimes against civilians in Gaza, because it might be too late in a few hours.” Australia planning ‘multiple’ repatriation flights today Foreign Minister Penny Wong says the Australian Government is planning “multiple” repatriation flights from Tel Aviv today for citizens wanting to leave. “We are co-ordinating options with partners who are helping their citizens with departures,” Senator Wong said in a post on X. “We are also arranging flights to assist travellers with their onward journey from Dubai to Australia. “A further update will be provided directly to registered Australians in coming hours.” The flights will, of course, “be subject to factors including the security environment”. Heavy police presence in Sydney, Melbourne More than 1000 police will bedeployed at pro-Palestine rallies in Sydney and Melbournetoday with concerns about whether “extraordinary powers” will be used on attendees. Hundreds of people are expected to gather in support of Palestinians under siege. They will be protesting despite calls for the rallies to be cancelled amid heightened tensions over the conflict, with NSW Premier Chris Minns and police urging Sydneysiders not to attend after anti-Semitic chants were head at a previous rally. Mr Minns said it would be “ruinous for Sydney’s sense of cohesion, our multicultural, multi-faith community” if there were repeat scenes at today’s event. “We couldn’t have those scenes again and police have got every right to protect and ensure that those scenes aren’t repeated over the weekend,” the Premier said. NSW Police will have the option of using “extraordinary powers” – such as searching protesters without reason and demanding they identify themselves on request. “We intend to search people that we believe are likely to protest or have shown an interest in protesting, based on the fact that weapons and flares, the experiences of Monday night,” acting commissioner David Hudson said. Group organisers have put a list of demands on attendees in an attempt to avoid violence or anti-Semitism, including banning the use of flares, anti-Semitic chants and face coverings for non-religious purposes. – Eli Green, NCA NewsWire Israeli air strike hits Syria’s Aleppo Airport Israel launched an air strike against Syria’s Aleppo Airport that put it out of service, the Syrian defence ministry said. “The Israeli enemy carried out an air attack from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, west of Latakia, targeting Aleppo International Airport, which led to material damage to the airport and it being out of service,” it said. The airport had just returned to service on Saturday after simultaneous missile attacks on both it, and the airport in Syria’s capital Damascas, by Israeli forces on Thursday. The defence ministry lambasted Israel for the strike, saying the act “confirms the criminal approach of the Israeli occupation” and accusing it of “crimes against the Palestinian people”. Forced relocation ‘tantamount to a death sentence’ The World Health Organisation (WHO) said Israel’s forcing of patients to relocate from health facilities in northern Gaza could be “tantamount to a death sentence”. Hospitals there are continuing to receive an influx of injured people, and are struggling to operate “beyond maximum capacity”. “Those in intensive care; those undergoing haemodialysis; newborns in incubators; women with complications of pregnancy, and others all face imminent deterioration of their condition or death if they are forced to move,” it said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter). “Forcing more than 2000 patients to relocate to southern #Gaza, where health facilities are already running at maximum capacity and unable to absorb a dramatic rise in the number [of] patients, could be tantamount to a death sentence.” Women and children killed while fleeing northern Gaza Women and young children were among those killed after a Palestinian convoy was hit while fleeing northern Gaza. According to theBBC, the strike occurred on Salah-al-Din street – one of two evacuation routes from north Gaza to the south. Palestinian journalist Hashem Al-Saudi toldCNNthat “the situation is much worse than what you see on television”. “Streets are filled with rubble and reek of blood,” Mr Al-Saudi said. “Even those who moved south were hit by air strikes … Nowhere is safe in the Gaza Strip. “Everyone on this piece of land is targeted by the Israeli military, which from the start did not differentiate between civilian and shoulder.” Hundreds of thousands of civilians fled the besieged region by car, on trucks and on foot on Saturday after being given a 24-hour warning by Israel to evacuate – orders that EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called “utterly impossible”. Graphic footage of the carnage at the scene, which emerged shortly afterwards, showed at least 12 bodies – with some of the children allegedly appearing as young as two to five years old. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 70 people were killed at the scene, and blame Israel for the attack. Israel claims to have killed Hamas leader who plotted massacre The Israeli air force says it has killed a senior Hamas leader who planned attacks that left over 1300 Israeli’s dead on October 7. Israeli forces claim Ali Qadhi, a company commander in the Najaba force of Hamas, was killed by a drone strike. The strike was reportedly launched after obtaining intelligence from Shin Bet security agency. Qadhi was reportedly arrested by Israel in 2005 over the kidnapping and murder of Israeli citizens. In 2011, he was released to Gaza as part of a prisoner swap. “Ali Qadi led the inhumane, barbaric October 7 massacre of civilians in Israel,” the IDF said following the drone strike. “We just eliminated him. All Hamas terrorists will meet the same fate.” Israel also claims Abu Merad, head of Hamas’ air forces, was killed. Israel preparing for ‘next stages of war’ The Israel Defence Forces said it is preparing for the “next stages of war” in a statement released just hours after its evacuation deadline for Gaza expired on Saturday. “With the support of an extensive logistical effort and hundreds of thousands of drafted reservists, IDF forces are currently preparing to implement a wide range of operational offensive plans, which can include combined and co-ordinated strikes from the air, sea and land,” the statement read. “IDF battalions and soldiers are deployed across the country and are increasing operational readiness for the next stages of war, with an emphasis on significant ground operations.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a video on social media earlier on Sunday morning of him visiting troops on the front line, telling them “the next stage is coming”. The IDF has swarmed the border of Gaza with troops and military equipment – but the exact contours of its plan for a siege remains unclear. No timings have been given for the attack. – with AFP Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

Revenge after Holocaust survivor kidnapped,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-has-taken-action-after-holocaust-survivor-mocked-online/news-story/226918cafe618f76637c8e2c3af83593,"Israeli forces have retaliated after a West Bank pizzeria cruelly mocked an elderly Holocaust survivor who was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists. The owners of the pizza restaurant, located in the town of Huwara, took to Facebook to share an edited photograph of the elderly woman, whose photograph was snapped during the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. The Holocaust survivor was seen in a distressing video followingher capture by Hamas, with the woman sitting in her wheelchair with a machine gun in her lap and with what appears to be a masked fighter beside her. On the pizzeria’s Facebook page, the picture had been crudely edited to show her holding a pizza alongside the phrase “you are welcome” with several laughing emojis, according to theTimes of Israel. The picture was reportedly advertising a deal for a family sized pizza. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered that the eatery, called the Eiffel Bakery and Supermarket, be destroyed. Many Israelis in the town gathered outside the restaurant after the advertisement appeared online, calling for their government to take action. The Israel Defence Forces arrived at the pizzeria on Thursday, detaining the owners and ordering the eatery to be shut down, citing its alleged support of terrorist activities. The owners of the establishment have claimed that someone else had posted the offensive ad on their Facebook page without their consent and have since issued an apology. “We are against harming men and women and just want to earn a living with dignity and live in peace with everyone,” it read. “We are very sorry to the members of our family and others who were hurt.” More than 2200 people have been killed in Israel’s bombing campaign of Gaza Strip, Palestinian authorities say, in the aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel last weekend, in which more than 1300 people were killed. In an update on the attack, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, told a press conference “grandparents and the elderly, among them holocaust survivors, who endured the Nazis, were violently dragged from their homes, this time by Hamas, and taken into Gaza.” Holding up a photo, Mr Erdan said an unidentified Holocaust survivor and grandmother was held in captivity and forced to pose with a Hamas rifle. “This is inhumane. Inhumane,” he said. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong says the Australian Government is planning “multiple” repatriation flights from Tel Aviv for citizens wanting to leave. “We are co-ordinating options with partners who are helping their citizens with departures,” Senator Wong said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “The situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories continues to change rapidly,” the post read. “Subject to factors including the security environment, the Australian Government is planning multiple flights to depart from Tel Aviv today, for Australians wanting to leave. “We are also arranging flights to assist travellers with their onward journey from Dubai to Australia. “A further update will be provided directly to registered Australians in coming hours.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

New warning for Aussies after air strikes,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/australia-scrambles-to-evacuate-citizens-from-israel-confirms-defence-flights/news-story/37eb348f41ccf3c7b3fcd4d68f3fd434,"Updated travel advice for Australians in Lebanon has been issued after the Israeli Defence Force commenced air strikes on Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon. Speaking to reporters in Adelaide on Sunday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong called on Australians to leave the country if their stay was unnecessary. “If you are in Lebanon, please consider whether your need to remain there is essential,” Senator Wong said. Wong also said Australians wishing to travel Lebanon should reconsider their plans. Later today, multiple evacuation flights are expected to depart from Tel Aviv, with Australians boarding Australian Defence Force and civilian charter aircraft, the foreign minister also confirmed. “I can confirm that the Australian government is planning multiple flights to depart from Tel Aviv today for Australians wanting to leave,” she said. “We are also co-ordinating options with partners who are helping their own citizens with departures. “If you wish to leave, we strongly encourage you to take the first option that becomes available to you. Please do not wait for a different option.” The foreign minister would not confirm the number of Australians who would be travelling aboard the flights. It follows the cancellation of two scheduled commercial flights on Saturday with the government citing a “highly challenging and rapidly changing” environment as the reason behind their scrapping. More than 800 Australians were aboard the first government assisted flight that landed in London late on Friday local time. About 10,000 Australians, many who are dual citizens and not seeking to leave, are currently in Israel. Earlier on Sunday, Defence Minister Richard Marles said the number of Australians who wanted to leave Israel was in the “high hundreds”. He told the ABC military planes would have greater flexibility than commercial options but circumstances, such as whether Israel’s airspace remained open, could complicate matters. “We are positioned, we have the intent to put in place flights very soon, almost immediately,” he said. “There is some greater flexibility that military flights offer in this circumstance.” Israeli forces on Saturday said it was preparing for “significant ground operations” in Gaza in response to the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas. Mr Marles said Israel had a right to defend itself but must “do that in a way where it acts in accordance with the rules of war”, later clarifying that he believed they were. Liberal MP Julian Leeser said Australia needed to reconsider its diplomatic ties with Iran. “Anybody who doesn’t think Iran has been supporting and financing Hamas over the years just hasn’t been paying attention,” he told the ABC. “Iran is the great disrupter in the Middle East, it’s disrupting Lebanon, it’s disrupting Syria. It is a malevolent force. “I think our support for Iran, our maintaining diplomatic relations, in a sense gives Iran a level of support and global acceptance that I think we should question.” Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

‘Reckoning’: Huge crowds at Palestine rally,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hopes-propalestine-protests-in-sydney-and-melbourne-will-remain-peaceful/news-story/6d72bcb6ecfc04538219373ab3c21211,"NSW Police have revealed they did not use special powers given to them to crack down on demonstrators as thousands gather at anti-war rallies. As many as 6000 people gathered in Sydney on Sunday for pro-Palestinian rallies, days after police requested use of “extraordinary powers”. The provisions would have allowed officers to stop and search demonstrators, but faced pushback from the event organisers and activists. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Tony Cooke said more than 100 officers were out in Sydney on Sunday, but did not deploy the powers. “It wasn’t necessary … Very clearly, based on the evidence of last Monday, there were serious concerns,” Ms Cooke said. “That was very much on the forefront of our minds, which is why you saw a significant police presence rolled out. “During the day I did not see it necessary to make the authorisation (to use the special powers)”.” Mr Cooke said no arrests had been made during Sunday’s rallies, but defended the powers being “appropriated” after last weekend’s rally. Demonstrators sparked uproar after they were caught on video chanting anti-Semitic slogans outside the Opera House last weekend. Mr Cooke said that since the event police had had “fruitful” conversations with organisers, who said anti-Semitic ralliers were “not welcome”. “I must say, discussions with those organising who had raised issues with us late in the week,” Mr Cooke said. “They were fruitful in that not undertakings but assurances that they had made in relation to behaviours. “There were people in the crowd that were providing the voice of reason to the members of their own communities﻿. “That is exactly what we would expect.” ﻿Thousands of Australians turned out at pro-Palestine rallies in Sydney and Melbourne, defying calls for such protests to be called off. More than 1000 police were deployed at the tense rallies, some of whom have demanded identification from attendees with face coverings. The large crowds gathered on Sunday in support of Palestinians under siege as Israel prepares for a ground invasion on north Gaza within hours. Huge crowds were seen at Sydney’s Hyde Park and in front of Melbourne’s State Library, many wearing red, green and white – the Palestinian flag colours. Protesters in Melbourne were caught lighting flares against the wishes of police. “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” the crowds were heard chanting. One speaker at the protest described the conflict as “disgusting”, condemning Israel’s orders for one million people to evacuate ahead of the ground invasion. Dozens of police officers were seen moving through the masses of pro-Palestine signs, many calling for a boycott of “apartheid Israel” and to “stop the Palestinian genocide”. Hundred of attendees packed out Sydney’s Hyde Park, many carrying Palestinian flags and banners calling for ‘Justice for Palestine’. Speaking about the calls from NSW Premier Chris Minns for organisers to cancel the protest, fellow organiser Josh Lees drew passionate boos and cries of “shame”. He said pro-Palestinian protesters did not support anti-Jewish sentiment, however he admitted it “did not help” that some attendees at Monday night’s protest began chanting anti-Semitic remarks. “Anyone who even begins to chant such slogans, everyone around them will tell them to shut up,” he said. “Today, we must be disciplined, we must be very peaceful.” He also announced another march slated for next Saturday at Sydney’s Town Hall and said organisers had already submitted paperwork to authorise the protest. However he said the result of Sunday’s protest would determine whether the demonstration would be allowed to go ahead. In between speeches, Mr Lees asked supporters to not attend the demonstration with their faces covered. Police were seen stopping and asking for the identification of several groups of protesters who attempted to cover their faces. Officers allowed the groups to continue into the protest after they took off the face coverings. Towards the end of the rally, one of the organisers lashed some attendees for allegedly making racist remarks. “I’ve just had about enough with some of the crowd right now,” she said. “I cannot believe that I am here to say that if I hear anything racist: get out of here!” “How dare you weaponise the Palestinian struggle for your racist chant, I’ve had it!” Her anti-racist stance was met with cheers from the audience. Jewish Australian academic Associate Professor Peter Slezak said there was a large contingency of the Jewish community who denounced the actions of the Israeli government. “Very many of us here and around the world who are distressed by what Israel has been doing in our name,” he said. “We must be able to, as many Jews have been saying recently, to grieve and mourn both Palestinian and Israeli deaths.” However, not everyone was supportive of the protests, with Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Alex Ryvchin declaring the rallies themselves, peaceful or not, an offence in themselves. “The Palestinian ‘resistance’ was revealed in the horrors of October 7 and on the steps of the Opera House,” he said. “The more disciplined among them have simply reverted to chanting in euphemisms calling for Israel’s destruction and the murder of civilians. The fact that these rallies are taking place just days after the deadliest slaughter of Jews for 80 years, says it all.” Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi and NSW Greens MP Jenny Leong also both attended the rally on Sunday. Ms Faruqi said her thoughts were with the people mourning loved ones, and said all civilian deaths should be condemned. “The truth is this: the atrocities being committed by Israel are war crimes,” she said. “This is not new. In Gaza, civilians are on the precipice of annihilation.” She also criticised the NSW government for their stance on the conflict. “The NSW Police and NSW government have made shameful attempts to stop up from getting together,” she said. “The truth is my friends, erasure of Palestinian suffering is a longstanding policy for both major parties in Australia. “This enables Israel, the oppression of Palestinians with impunity and that is an utter disgrace.” Speaking to the crowd, one Palestine Action Group organiser said there had been a global complicity in enabling Israel’s counter attack against Palestinians on the Gaza Strip. Between speeches, organisers urged crowds to chant phrases like: “Free, free Palestine, from the river to the sea. Palestine will be free”. Muslim, Christian and Jewish prayers were delivered during the protest, acknowledging the wide backgrounds of attendees. Australian Palestinian Fahad Ali delivered an emotional address to the crowd and said Palestinians had a right to “defend ourselves from being slaughtered”. “We need to be clear for more than ever, more than ever, we need to call for an end to the occupation as a call for the end to the blockade,” he said. Mr Ali said politicians like Mr Minns had turned a “blind eye” to the struggle of Palestinians. “My message to politicians is that Palestine will be free and a day of reckoning is coming,” he said. “You will have to contend with the fact that a genocide was being perpetrated, and you did nothing.” Sydney woman, Sereen Omran, 23 said there had been a lot of misrepresentation of Palestinians who have suffered a history of genocide and displacement. Ms Omran, whose mother is a Palestinian refugee, said today’s demonstration was important for the community to show a united front. “What we want to do specifically today is to showcase we’re fighting for human rights. We want to recognise Israel should be condemned for the violence they’re playing out in Gaza and on Palestine in general.” Sundays protest in Sydney went ahead despite calls for the rallies to be cancelled amid high tensions over the conflict, with NSW Premier Chris Minns and police urging Sydneysiders not to attend after anti-Semitic chants were heard at a previous rally. Mr Minns had a grim warning for Sydneysiders if the scenes at the protest on Monday were repeated on the weekend. “That would be ruinous for Sydney‘s sense of cohesion, our multicultural, multi-faith community, we couldn’t have those scenes again and police have got every right to protect and ensure that those scenes aren’t repeated over the weekend,” he said. NSW Police were given the option of using “extraordinary powers” such as searching protesters without reason and demanding they identify themselves on request. “We intend to search people that we believe are likely to protest or have shown an interest in protesting, based on the fact that weapons and flares, the experiences of Monday night,” acting commissioner David Hudson said earlier in the week. Group organisers put a list of demands on attendees in an attempt to avoid violence or anti-Semitism, including banning the use of flares, anti-Semitic chants and face coverings for non-religious purposes. “We will not tolerate any person bringing flags or any items associated with Hezbollah or Hamas or any other item associated with designated terrorist organisations,” the group said in its list of requirements for protesters “Having these flags in your possession is a criminal offence. You will be removed from the rally.” Palestine Action Group also warned about inflammatory conduct from police and counter-protesters. “There may be counter-protesters that show up at the rally with Israeli flags to provoke us. Do not under any circumstances approach them,” they wrote. “We ask that you do not provoke police on the day, even if their conduct is inflammatory. This can lead to a quick escalation of violence that will put all protesters at risk.” Police in Adelaide provided an escort for a march as part of a similar protest on Sunday afternoon. In a statement, officers said they were “pleased with the conduct of the crowd, who behaved in a safe, orderly and lawful manner”. “There were no reports or arrests made.” Peaceful protests were also seen in Brisbane, Canberra and Perth on Friday night. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk. The man was arrested “to prevent a breach of the peace” after he showed up to support Israel at a pro-Palestine rally.

Landlord’s wild act as woman held hostage,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/landlord-demands-rent-money-from-woman-kidnapped-by-hamas-terrorists-family-says/news-story/6d15ebc6299d0bde44fb25ed3ddd12a0,"A heartless landlord has allegedly demanded the roommate of a young Israeli woman who was kidnapped by Hamas at a music festival pay her half of the rent — and threatened to throw out her belongings if he did not receive it, according to a report. Inbar Hyman, 27, was among the masses who attended the Supernova ravewhere 260 people were slaughteredat the start of the terror group’s attack on Israel. Many were abducted Saturday, including the young student. The landlord of the apartment in the northern city of Haifa, where Ms Hyman has been living with her boyfriend of two years, has demanded the full rent for the unit, Walla News and theNew York Postreported. When the boyfriend, Noam Allon, told him Ms Hyman had been abducted, he allegedly replied: “Look for replacements. You are not doing me a favour by living there. “Let it be clear to you: You have an obligation for the rent of 2500 shekels (about $A999). You can talk to her parents about vacating the room.” Noam’s father, Mordi Allon, posted a screenshot of the exchange with the landlord, and it has since gone viral amid the national tragedy. “Inbar is 27 years old, she and my son Noam have been together for two years. They study together and she is in her fourth year of studying visual communication,” Mr Allon told Walla News. “On Saturday, she went with her friends to the nature party in Re’im and served as a helper for people who were feeling unwell. “Her partner reached me and told me the landlord contacted him and asked what about the rent money. He wrote to him that Inbar was kidnapped and it just didn’t interest him.” Rather than show some empathy, the landlord allegedly told the boyfriend to remove Ms Hyman’s belongings if he did not pay her portion of the rent. But the landlord, identified by the Ynet news outlet as Aaron Reiss, denied the allegation and claimed he made no such demands for the money. “I share in the sorrow of the dear parents — that their daughter will return safely and whole and as soon as possible,” he told the outlet. “In essence, there is a whirlwind of shaming here. My tenant and the abducted woman do not owe me a shekel. How did it come to this whole situation? I don’t know. I didn’t ask for money — not from her family and certainly not from her,” Mr Reiss said. “Her possessions remain. It hasn’t been touched and it won’t be touched,” he added. When asked if he wanted to apologise, he told Ynet: “For what? For something that didn’t happen?” Earlier, a furious Mordi Allon told Walla News: “I am 52 years old, I never thought in my life that I would see such obstinance.” He ripped into the landlord for his alleged willingness to put Ms Hyman’s belongings on the street and seek another tenant while she is held captive by Hamas. “From the moment the post went up, I receive hundreds of responses that I should give the name of the person. No one is able to understand this stubbornness, meanness and insensitivity,” Mr Allon said. “I published this so that apartment owners beware of treating other people like this and think twice. … I deliberately did not publish his name and his phone number to give him time to apologise. I do not want to hear from him until Inbar is returned to Israel,” he said. “One of the terrorists grabbed her and threatened her with a knife,” Mr Allon added, citing accounts from two young men who were with her during the attack. “One of the guys who was with her attacked the terrorist with a wooden board. They shouted at her to run and she froze and they kidnapped her with a motorcycle.” The family learned that Ms Hyman was abducted to Gaza through a video on social media. “Hamas published a video in which she appears. We were able to identify her by her coloured tights and the purple shirt she was wearing when four terrorists were dragging her and shouting that she should be brought to the military wing of Hamas,” Mr Allon said. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have offered to help the young couple with the payment. The Maccabi Haifa soccer team also has reportedly offered to finance the apartment for a year, Ynet reported. “We have enough offers for donations to pay the rent 2000 months ahead,” Mordi Allon told the outlet, adding that an attorney representing the boyfriend is handling the matter and ordered the landlord not to touch Ms Hyman’s belongings. “I don’t have time to mess with him, there are more important things than a greedy landlord. We need to get her home,” he said. “Many people said they were shaking in front of the keyboard when they saw this. … I don’t know how it feels for him to get up this morning and to find out that he is the most hated man in the country,” Mr Allon added.

‘Spit on you’: Sick texts from hostage’s phone,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/harrowing-texts-sent-from-phone-of-hamas-hostage-shani-louks-missing-boyfriend-are-revealed/news-story/97e51e846aeb33c31da26480160beea0,"A chilling rant has been sent from the phone of Shani Louk’s missing boyfriend amid fears he has been abducted by Hamas terrorists. Tattoo artist Shani, 22, and her partner Orión Hernández Radoux, 30, were among unsuspecting ravers at an Israeli music festival when Hamas gunmen unleashed carnage. Militants massacred at least 260 people while others were dragged to Gaza,The Sunreports. German-Israeli citizen Shani was feared dead after horrifying footage showed her seemingly body being paraded on a pickup truck. But Shani’s mother, Ricarda Louk, said her family had received word she is alive but has a serious head injury and is in critical condition. Her boyfriend Orión, meanwhile, is missing and it’s feared he is being held hostage by Hamas terrorists. Harrowing messages written in Arabic have been sent from the boyfriend’s phone as his family desperately try to find out what has happened to him. Sick texts seen byThe Sunsay “I spit on you” and “God damn you”. They also vow to “liberate Palestine” and make it “free of Zionists”. Friends say Orión, from Mexico, travelled to the Negev desert for the music festival to share his knowledge of Mexican traditional huichol art and to DJ. Peace activist Shani - who is German but grew up in Israel - had shared a sweet photo of the pair on her Instagram in July and called him “my love”. It comes as Shani’s family blasted the German government for ignoring their pleas for help. Her mum Ricarda has begged authorities for support after she said she had been told her daughter is still alive - insisting “every minute is critical”. But Shani’s aunt Orly Rouk said the German government is yet to reach out. She and Shani’s uncle Wilfied Gehr told local TV: “We’ve been begging the German government to help for three days now. “We are unsettled and totally disappointed that the Federal Government does not feel responsible. “One from the Foreign Office said he doesn’t have time because they have to rebook flights. That makes me so angry.” In a heartbreaking video, Ricarda held up a photo of her daughter on her phone and begged for help. She said: “This morning my daughter, Shani Nicole Louk, a German citizen, was kidnapped with a group of tourists in southern Israel by Palestinian Hamas. “We were sent a video in which I could clearly see our daughter unconscious in the car with the Palestinians and them driving around the Gaza Strip. “I ask you to send us any help or any news. Thank you very much.” Shan’s family have not heard from her since Saturday morning. Israel was caught off guard as gunmen stormed over the border on Saturday - shooting down men, women and children in their homes. After smashing through the border, hundreds of Hamas terrorists rampaged for hours and massacred at least 260 revellers at the peace festival. They dragged an estimated 150 soldiers and civilians - including men, women, children and the elderly - into captivity in Gaza. This story was reproduced fromThe Sunwith permission.

‘Burning us’: Family’s terrifying final texts,https://www.news.com.au/world/israeli-mans-final-texts-before-family-murdered-by-hamas/news-story/43387058f8774de2ce994c81e58529a5,"An Israeli-American family living in a kibbutz that was under attack from Hamas on Saturday had texted their relatives just moments before being killed by terrorists. “They’re here. They’re burning us. We’re suffocating,” 36-year-old father Johnny Siman Tov wrote to a relative. He and his wife Tamar Kedem-Simian Tov and their three children, aged between two and five, were all killed on Saturday. Johnny‘s 70-year-old mother Carol Simian Tov was also killed in the attack after fleeing to her property’s safe room. Stark images have shown a glimpse of the horrors faced by Israelis living kibbutz’s near the Gaza border, where more than 100 people were killed in an attack by Hamas militants. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) allowed reporters, including a Fox News crew, to visit Be’eri, a community located five kilometres from the Gaza border. The community of 1,200 was overrun by Hamas terrorists on Saturday, who attacked with grenades, guns, and knives. The immediate retaliation from Israel has sent a shiver across the globe as analysts fear thousands more will die in the resulting war. IDF soldiers immediately engaged in an eight-hour battle to force Hamas out of the kibbutz, going door-to-door to eliminate terrorists hiding inside Israeli homes. The kibbutz was the last settlement to be freed from Hamas intruders as the terrorists bunkered down inside the ruins. The site was not declared safe for outsiders until Tuesday after officials had removed the victims’ bodies. Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst took viewers inside one of the bloodied homes, pointing out bullet holes and blood stains on the floors. Some buildings showed signs of being hit by RPG rockets, with “beds covered in blood” found throughout the settlement. “You can see the floors are stained with blood,” Yingst said. “It was Saturday morning, around 7am, when militants stormed this village. You can see the weapons they brought with them, extra ammunition, bullet holes in the side of the house and knives on the floor. “It is completely destroyed. It looks like some of the buildings were hit with RPGs, explosives.” An Aussie couple who survived a horrific bus crash in Peru and were left stranded for weeks have revealed their “ordeal” trying to get home.

‘White woman tears’: Molan explodes,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/erin-molan-clashes-with-propalestinian-activist-dr-randa-abdelfattah-over-israelhamas-conflict/news-story/5a93a3612062afeb7bb5bd9f0a8e64a5,"Sky News host Erin Molan was accused of shedding “white woman tears” in a fierce argument with pro-Palestinian activist Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah on live TV. Molan was interviewing the prominent Australian writer shortly after news broke of Israel’s 24-hour warning for civilians to evacuate Gaza. Hamas terrorists invaded Israel from Gaza on Saturday, brutally murdering 1,300 people including children and babies. In response Israel has launched more than 6,000 airstrikes on Gaza, warning civilians to move south as it prepares for an expected ground invasion. Molan condemned Dr Abdel-Fattah, author ofComing of Age in the War on Terror,for failing to call out Hamas and recognise it as a terrorist organisation, leading to a heated exchange over past atrocities dealt by Israel. She called out the academic for “defending Hamas in the past”, making reference to an ideas panel she sat on in 2021 with a known Hamas “terrorist”. Dr Abdel-Fattah said she “does not see Hamas as a terrorist organisation” and repeatedly made reference to the historic “apartheid” being carried out on Palestinian civilians by the state of Israel. She claimed that the current state of affairs is the culmination of many years of oppression on the Palestinian people, insinuating media hosts are not reporting the bigger picture. “I have already said I condemn the violence that Hamas perpetrated, and it should be held to account,” she said. “I don’t see them as a terrorist organisation. What is the purpose of a terrorist label here? “Let’s talk about Israel’s terrorism on Palestinians. Israel is the occupying power settler colony, it is the one that has the International Human Rights Organisation declaring it is practising apartheid.” Molan said she had cried while watching images of injured children in Gaza hospitals, to which Dr Abdel-Fattah responded: “God bless white woman’s tears”. “My tears have existed for any atrocity that has occurred to any child in the world. I have asked you talk about what Hamas has done to Israeli babies,” Molan said. “You said the reason Saturday occurred because your people have been oppressed. If you feel justified in a war, fight Israeli soldiers with guns, not killing babies.” Denying the had “justified” their actions, Dr Abdel-Fattah went on to say Palestine had been under siege and denied basic human rights, and is outnumbered by the “occupying power” and “settler colony” of Israel. She called for more focus on the Israeli state, who she believes are the true perpetuators of violence in the conflict-stricken region. Hamas fighters have delayed the release of a second wave of hostages after the first group of women and children were freed, some too weak to even walk.

MP spotted in crowd at Israel rally,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/huge-crowds-attend-propalestinian-rallies-in-canberra-brisbane-and-perth/news-story/983094d2bfc9c8445d147c722de43d4b,"A federal MP was spotted in the crowd of a pro—Israel rally as hundreds of Pro-Palestinian protesters flooded the streets of capital cities across the country. Australians in Canberra, Brisbane and Perth gathered in support of the heavily-bombarded Palestinians on Friday night as Israel continues to send warplanes into Gaza in retaliation for attacks from Hamas militants. At the same time, thousands gathered at Caulfield Park in Melbourne to show their support for the Jewish community at “United with Israel” rally. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan, opposition leader John Pesutto and Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus all addressed the crowd at the rally while senator Bridget Mckenzie also made a public appearance. ﻿Meanwhile, independent federal MP Monique Ryan decided to make less of a fuss about her attendance at the rally, quietly blending into the crowd to show her support for the Jewish community. Pro-Palestine rally attendees in the nation’s capital were seen peacefully waving flags, as a small group of counter-protestors stood nearby holding signs. Regarded as Israel’s 9/11, Hamas launched its deadliest attack on the country on Saturday, firing 3500 rockets into the contested territory. Israel has warned 1.1 million civilians in north Gaza that they have 24 hours to relocate to the south, with its military chief declaring “now is the time for war”. Protesters at the Canberra rally called on the Australian government to do more to support Palestinians under siege. One leader wanted the government to “call out Israel’s breaches of international laws, including the fourth Geneva convention and UN resolutions”. The rallies in Canberra and Brisbane come on the same day that NSW Premier Chris Minns has urged residents of his state not to attend protests planned for this weekend in Sydney. “Obviously, I’m concerned about the assembly on Sunday,” Mr Minns told the media on Friday. NSW Police revealed they may use extraordinary powers to search those planning to attend the pro-Palestine protests after a previous rally organised by the same group featured anti-Semitic chants. “We intend to search people that we believe are likely to protest or have shown an interest in protesting, based on the fact that weapons and flares, the experiences of Monday night,” acting commissioner David Hudson said. Mr Minns has repeatedly condemned the actions of protesters on Monday night, despite the organisers claiming that they were a “tiny fringe” of “vile anti-Semitic attendees” who were not connected to the rally. “Now, I think it is fair to note that whether that protest was hijacked or there was malevolent intent from the very beginning, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “The organisers of the protest have proven to the NSW police, the government, people of NSW that they can’t manage a peaceful protest.” Mr Minns had a grim warning for Sydneysiders if the scenes on Monday were repeated on the weekend. “That would be ruinous for Sydney‘s sense of cohesion, our multicultural, multi-faith community, we couldn’t have those scenes again and police have got every right to protect and ensure that those scenes aren’t repeated over the weekend,” he said.

Aussies arrive in Israel as Gaza strike looms,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/australianisraeli-military-reservists-arrive-in-israel-as-gaza-ground-invasion-looms/news-story/1d54e3a24a2f6bb1fe897624137f1a22,"Australians are among hundreds of thousands of Israeli Defence Force reservists who have arrived in Israel to take up arms as the military prepares for an imminent ground invasion of Gaza. In an unprecedented move, the Israeli government has mobilised 360,000 reserve soldiers from around the world, including a number of Israeli-Australians, an Israeli government official has confirmed. The mobilisation comes in the wake of the weekend’s assault by Hamas, who overran towns, kibbutzes and army bases near Gaza, killing more than 1300 civilians and soldiers, and resulting in Israel’s retaliatory declaration of war. It is understood that a number of Australian citizens boarded a flight from Bangkok where transport planes dispatched by the IDF flew to Israel. Other Australians have taken commercial flights to Ben Gurion International Airport. NCA NewsWire understands Israel’s ambassador to Australia will meet Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Monday. The mobilisation is the largest military draft in the history of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) with reservists from around the world compulsorily required to assist in the fighting efforts. Military service is required for many Israelis when they turn 18. The move follows an announcement from the Israeli military on Friday which called on the 1.1 million Palestinians living in the north of the Gaza Strip to evacuate to the south by midnight. “The IDF calls for the evacuation of all civilians of Gaza City from their homes southwards for their own safety and protection and move to the area south of the Wadi Gaza,” a statement from the IDF reads. “Civilians of Gaza City, evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields.” The Israeli military is preparing for a possible ground operation in Gaza, with the evacuation order signalling the offensive may be imminent. But the United Nations has criticised the intervention, with UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric arguing it would be “impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences”. “The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded, avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation,” Mr Dujarric said. The Home Affairs Department has been contacted for comment.

‘Concerned’: Premier’s warning to tense city,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/premier-chris-minns-warning-to-sydney-over-israelgaza-tensions/news-story/c538003288051c6dce8c950de82b5f64,"Chris Minns has said that he is “concerned” about upcoming pro-Palestine protests amid a spate of alleged anti-Semitic acts recorded across Sydney. The NSW Premier said that while there is still a right to protest in NSW, “everyone has a right to be free from racial vilification, incitement to violence, actual violence or racism on the streets”. The unauthorised protest planned for Sunday is still set to go ahead despite attempts to shut it down by NSW Police following anti-Semitic chants at a similar protest on Monday night. “Obviously, I‘m concerned about the assembly on Sunday,” Mr Minns told the media on Friday. “I’m hoping it’s done peacefully and I’m hoping that the organisers and the participants at that assembly prove me wrong and we can get through the weekend in a peaceful way.” Mr Minns had a grim warning for Sydneysiders if the scenes on Monday were repeated on the weekend. “That would be ruinous for Sydney‘s sense of cohesion, our multicultural, multi-faith community, we couldn’t have those scenes again and police have got every right to protect and ensure that those scenes aren’t repeated over the weekend,” he said. Police plan to use “extraordinary powers” to search protesters without reason and demand they identify themselves on request. “We intend to search people that we believe are likely to protest or have shown an interest in protesting, based on the fact that weapons and flares, the experiences of Monday night,” acting commissioner David Hudson said. “We will also be demanding they provide us with their identity. So that they cannot disguise themselves in the crowd … without fear of retribution.” Throughout the week, Mr Minns fiercely condemned the actions of pro-Palestinian protesters involved Monday’s rally. “To have some people celebrate atrocious indiscriminate killing and kidnapping in Israel is appalling,” he said. “This is the opposite of the dynamic multicultural community we want in NSW and Australia.” Dozens of Islamic community groups have called on the government to “end the double standards” and acknowledge the loss of Palestinian lives in the conflict. A joint letter from 41 groups rejected the “one-sided portrayal of the Palestinian issue in Australia” and condemned all “calls and incitement to violence and hatred of any people”, including anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim or Islamophobic attitudes. “Enough is enough. The voice of Australian Muslims and proponents of justice for all people will no longer be silenced on the matter of Palestine,“ the letter said. Mr Minns defended his and police attempts to shut down Sunday‘s protests, saying that NSW was facing calls for violence not seen at other pro-Palestine protests. “Other states didn‘t see what we saw on Monday night in Sydney and the decision that the NSW Police backed by the NSW government has not been done in isolation... it’s been done on the back of what was a protest that went wrong,” he said. “And I don‘t think anyone not even the organizers of the protest can claim that it was a success. It was not peaceful.” He vowed that there would be “no tolerance for racial vilification on Sydney streets”. Mr Minns called the snap press conference after three men were arrested for allegedly performing a Nazi salute outside Sydney’s Jewish Museum. Officers were called to Darlinghurst Road in Darlinghurst shortly before midday on Friday where they arrested three men. NSW Police have not yet revealed the details about the incident but police cars have lined the streets outside the museum. “While there is no ongoing risk to the public Darlinghurst Road remains closed the public to ongoing inquiries,” a NSW Police spokesperson said. It’s understood there were no threats of violence involved in the incident. Authorities have warned of “heavy” traffic and delays in a popular tourist strip after a multi-vehicle accident, believed to have involved a luxury car, forced the road to close. Thousands of young music lovers have descended on one of the largest festivals of the year, but there are serious concerns about hail, rain and dangerous winds.

‘Appalled’: Senator’s Israel rally swipe,https://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/criminal-siege-on-gaza-protest-groups-huge-claim-on-israelhamas-conflict-as-hundreds-to-rally-in-support-in-melbourne-sydney/news-story/2c54d00d1cb92ec9b0b2c00f891db5e8,"A NSW MP has voiced her outrage at what she says is “appalling” pro-Palestine propaganda at a rally in support of Israel and the Jewish community. Allegra Spender, who represents the division of Wentworth, made the comments at a rally calling for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas on Sunday, as hundreds across the country attended pro-Israel and Palestine rallies. Ms Spender took to the microphone at the rally to call out what she said was pro-Palestine “propaganda she had witnessed in her electorate. “I have been appalled by some of the posters, the graffiti that my community has had to live through over this last period,” she said. “Nobody should feel afraid to be part of their community, no one should feel targeted or isolated.” Hundreds of people gathered in Melbourne and Sydney at demonstrations calling for an end to the conflict in the Gaza Strip, following a contentious week of protests all over the nation. Federal Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg took the opportunity to criticise Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi for openly supporting Palestine and proudly being pictured at a student protest next to offensive signs. “Just in the last few days we see a Senator of the Commonwealth standing next to someone with a deeply anti-Semitic slogan which is proposing the same thing as Hamas, which is to remove the state of Israel from the map,” he said “The fact that is being paraded around publicly in that way shows we have a massive problem in this country.” Mr Bragg also said he does not support the ceasefire with Hamas. “We have not supported the ridiculous, juvenile calls for a ceasefire,” he said. “Because that organisation’s (Hamas) objective is to destroy the state of Israel and that is something we will never support.” Sunday’s gathering was the first pro-Israel rally held in Sydney since the Hamas attack in early October, while at the same time Senator Lidia Thorpe was on stage in Melbourne talking at a Free Palestine rally. Ms Thorpe has promised to stand up and make a statement “every day” against a system she says is promoting “genocide” after being welcomed to thunderous applause at a pro-Palestine rally. Senator Thorpe promised she would “not let this colonial system perpetrate and facilitate genocide” for as long as it would take. “I will make a statement every day this war continues,” she said. Senator Thorpe also rallied support for the Blak Sovereign Movement and planned protests ahead of Australia Day next year. “Over 550 deaths in custody and counting, incarceration rates worse than anywhere else... we know your pain,” she said. “We are sorry that you have lost so many babies and so many family members. “We understand that pain, and we stand with you every minute of every day.” She told the crowd there was “nothing” to celebrate with the ongoing war, something she called was a “genocide”. Thorpe apologised for not having been to any earlier protests as she took the stage dressed in red and black wearing face paint and a scarf with the Palestinian flag on it. A large crowd gathered outside the State Library of Victoria as they were waiting for Ms Thorpe to speak. The energetic crowd was fired up, even in the less-than-ideal weather, with one speaker taking the stage before Ms Thorpe calling into question the ceasefire with Israel. “Make no mistake this is not a ceasefire, this is a pause,” the man said. “Israeli terrorist forces are still intending to carry on their genocidal attack. “This pause is temporary but the trauma and the pain the people of Gaza will carry is permanent.” Thorpe took to the stage she apologised for not having been to any earlier protests and said she stood with Palestine, dressed in red and black wearing face paint and a scarf with the Palestinian flag on it. Victorian Greens Senator Gabrielle de Vietri then took the stage calling for a free Gaza amidst the ceasefire. “Four days to take a breath. Four days to have a meal. Four days to collect the bodies of loved ones,” the member for Richmond said. Before leaving the stage Ms de Vietri started a chant. “Free, free Palestine. Shame, shame Israel. Shame, shame USA. Shame, Shame Labor party,” she cried. The crowd then marched down Swantson St towards Flinders Street Station, chanting “in our thousands, in our millions, we are all Palestinians” with police having to marshall at intersections diverting traffic. At the same time in Hyde Park in Sydney Free Palestine protesters gathered in red and black, waving Palestinian flags, some covered in mock blood. A large Palestinian flag was laid out on the ground at the park as part of the protest. A bike ride from Bankstown to Brighton in support of Gaza will also take place today. The rallies come as Hamas announced it had released a second group of Israeli and foreign civilians it had been holding hostage in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Speaking on the hostage release Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Alex Ryvchin, said that it was still “difficult to feel joy” after the Hamas attacks of last month. “We feel relief and gratitude that some of the most vulnerable hostages including babies and the elderly are now free, away from the hell of Hamas captivity,” he said. “But it is difficult to feel joy knowing that some of the hostages are orphaned or the last surviving members of their families. It is difficult to feel joy knowing that on October 7 so many children were tortured, raped and burned alive. His comments come as hundreds of people took to the streets of Sydney in support of Israel in a sea of blue and white. Yellow balloons were placed on chairs in Sydney’s Martin Place that had flyers taped to them reading kidnapped showing the photos of those take by Hamas. Protests over the past few months have been rocked by confronting scenes, some comparing the Jewish state to Nazi Germany and carrying fake, bloodied corpses around at rallies. Hundreds of schoolkids across the country defied warnings as they walked off campuses in support of Palestine this week, despite politicians urging them to stay in school. NSW Education Minister Prue Car said students should not be “skipping school” for protesting. NSW Premier Chris Minns made on Wednesday said: “If you want to change the world, get an education and this is precisely why we have a world class public education system.” He said making school “the enemy” was the wrong move as he wanted children to be “fully educated to be knowledgeable about the world.” A man in a wheelchair allegedly punched and spat on police before being Tasered in a busy city street.

"Heartwarming video of hostages, family",https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/safe-at-last-heartwarming-moment-families-reunite-with-children-snatched-by-hamas/news-story/c27bf6b66f5dd591d95360228fbb2778,"Touching pictures show the moment Israeli families were reunited with their children who were released by Hamas on Friday after 48 days in captivity. It comes as the terrorist group delays releasing the next group of 13 hostages following alleged violations of the truce deal by Israel. A senior Hamas official claimed the terror group delayed the release of more hostages because Israel only let three out of 100 aid trucks into northern Gaza as part of their humanitarian truce deal,The Sun reports. He further alleged Israel flew drones over southern Gaza, killed two Palestinians in an area where civilians are free to move, and made changes to the agreed list of Palestinian prisoners to be released. Israel denied breaking the terms of the truce deal, tellingAFP: “Israel has not violated the agreement.” Yesterday, Hamas militants handed over 13 terrified Israeli women and children after holding them captive for 48 days. The hostages were pulled from blacked-out vans by masked Hamas militants and passed over to Red Cross workers. Heartwarming footage released by an Israeli children’s hospital shows the moment nine-year-old Ohad Munder was reunited with his family. The clip shows him carrying a cuddly toy, turning a corner in the hospital and waving to two relatives including his father. Ohad runs to greet them as his dad picks him up and spins him round in a touching reunion. The nine-year-old was freed yesterday alongside 12 other Israeli women and children – several from the same families. Ohad’s cousin said: “I’m waiting to see Ohad and can’t wait to give him his Rubik’s cube which I know he really loved and he probably missed it so much. That’s the first thing he takes everywhere he goes.” Pictures of the released hostages show Ohad playing with a Rubik’s cube on a flight with his mother and grandmother, presumably on his way home. The nine-year-old, his mother and grandmother Ruth who were also kidnapped are apparently in good health. But his grandfather, Avraham, is reportedly still in captivity in Gaza according to theHindustan Times. A heartwarming picture also released by the children’s hospital shows 5-year-old Emilia Aloni reuniting with her grandmother. She was taken with her mother Daniel on October 7, and Ohad was snatched alongside his mother Keren Munder. Yaffa Adar, 85, who was kidnapped on October 7 and pictured riding on the back of a Hamas buggy, was also released. Her granddaughter Orian Adar said her family was “very excited” to see her. “Her resilience moved us very much, it’s inspiring,” she said. “We ask everyone to remember, we can’t see the sun yet because there are many more people still out there. “We need everyone with us at home, don’t stop until the last abductee comes home to us.,”Sky Newsreports. Yoni Asher, whose wife Doron and daughters – Raz, 4, and Aviv, 2, – was reunited with his family on Friday. Their four-year-old daughter said: “I dreamt that we were going home,” to which her father said: “We are home, we are going to our house soon.” All 13 Israeli hostages were sent to separate hospitals across Israel, where medical staff said most of them appeared to be in good physical health. Footage of the innocent women and children being released is hard to watch – one woman was even unable to walk on her own and had to be carried from van to van. She could be seen gripping onto the Hamas fighter as he carried her the short distance between the two vehicles. The women and children were released after being held hostage for nearly 50 days, during the second day of the ceasefire. More hostages are expected to be released over the coming days during the pause in fighting. Israeli authorities have said 13 more hostages will be freed by Hamas today in exchange for 42 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas agreed to free at least 50 of the 240 hostages it snatched on October 7 in return for 150 Palestinian prisoners kept in Israeli prisons. Both sides said they would release women and children first. And yesterday Qatar confirmed that 39 women and children kept in Israeli prisons – mostly teenagers imprisoned for minor offences – were also let go. The footage, released by Hamas, showed the masked fighters handing over Israeli and Thai civilians to international aid workers. A total of 24 hostages were freed from Gaza, 13 Israeli women and children, 10 Thai nationals and one Filipino. No British hostages were released on Friday, according toSky News. The truce-for-hostages deal was reached after weeks of intense negotiations – with Qatar, the United States and Egypt serving as mediators. If it holds, it will mark the first significant break in fighting since Israel declared war on Hamas seven weeks ago, raising hopes of eventually winding down the war. The pause in fighting comes after bomb-blitzed Gaza was relentlessly pummelled by Israel’s airstrikes and ground operation. Netanyahu insisted that Israel’s mission remains unchanged, stating that the offensive will resume once the ceasefire period ends. He said: “We are at war and we will continue the war until we achieve all our goals.” An IDF spokesperson had claimed that around 215 hostages remain in Gaza. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed on Friday evening that 13 Israeli hostages and 11 foreign nationals were freed. He said in a video statement: “I emphasise to you, the families, and to you, the citizens of Israel: We are committed to returning all our hostages. “This is one of the war’s objectives, and we’re committed to achieving all of the war’s objectives.” In return for the hostages, 39 Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons were freed, a Qatari official said. Among those freed today were Danielle Aloni and her six-year-old daughter Emilia who were horrifyingly kidnapped in Kibbutz Nir Oz while they were visiting family. Danielle’s sister and brother-in-law Sharon Aloni-Cunio and David Cunio are reportedly still hostages alongside their three-year-old twin daughters. Adina Moshe, 72, was also taken from her home in Nir Oz moments after her husband was slaughtered by the terrorists and Doron Katz Asher, 34, and her two brave young daughters Aviv and Raz were all kidnapped in the same area. The mother and her two and four-year-old girls were taken as they visited a relatives house. Keren and Ohan Munder and Ruth Munder, 78, were all released today after they were rounded up and forced to leave Ruth’s house. Ruth’s partner and Ohad’s grandfather is thought to still be held by Hamas as only women and children were among those let go. Hana Katzir, 76, was also sensationally freed after Hamas forces reportedly claimed she had died earlier this week. The final three people saved in the first set of releases were Margalit Moses, 77, Yaffa Adar, 85, and Hanna Peri, 79. Yoni Asher, husband to Doron and father of their two little girls who were freed on Friday said: “I am determined to help my family recover from the terrible trauma and loss we went through”. Palestinian people in the West Bank also celebrated as their civilians were released from the Ofer military base, AFP reports.

‘Praying’: Israeli hostage families plea to PM,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/painful-wait-for-families-as-hamas-and-israel-extend-ceasefire-and-hostage-exchange/news-story/039b18901fe8566e3a721b42aac57956,"The mother of a 22-year-old man who has been held hostage by Hamas after being kidnapped in his home by militants has pleaded for confirmation of the safety of her son. Iris Haim, whose son, Yotam, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz in the early hours of October 7, said she lives in fear every day she doesn’t see her son listed by militants for release as part of hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas. “Everyone’s praying that their son will be on the list,” Ms Haim told reporters. “My family, we are living in psychological terror because they don’t give names until the last minute, while we wait in fear.” Ms Haim joined four other family members and representatives of people who were kidnapped or murdered by Hamas on October 7 ahead of a meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, deputy Richard Marles and Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Tuesday. They have flown to Australia from Israel to meet with senior government officials to call for the immediate release of all 240 hostages thought to be held captive by Hamas. Mr Albanese welcomed the group and thanked them for raising the issue and ensuring it is front of mind for Australians. “I just express on behalf of the government and on behalf of the Australian people our sincere sympathy and condolences for your loss of loved ones, friends and family,” he said. “And our commitment to continue to call consistently, unequivocally for the release of all the hostages that have now been taken for a long period of time. “I’m sorry about the circumstances for your visit here to Australia. But you are very, very welcome here.” Elad Levy, 49, whose 19-year-old niece Roni Eshel, an IDF soldier, was murdered on October 7, said he believed there was a very strong distinction between Hamas terrorists and the Palestinian people. “Hamas is a terrorist organisation. They kill people for being people, not Muslims, not believing - they kill Muslims and Arabs in Gaza. They kill their own people,” he said. Tali Kizhner, 50, whose 22-year-old son Sergev was murdered while attending a music festival after Hamas gunmen initiated a surprise attack on October 7, issued to tearful plea to people spreading anti-Semitic messages to grieving families. “It was not a matter of religion, it was not a matter of gender. They [Hamas] simply came to kill everyone,” she said.“We deserve peace and quiet and we do not understand why people are saying these horrible, anti-Semitic things about us. Hatred is a disease.” Mr Albanese said the rise in anti-Semitism, domestically and internationally, is a major concern for the government. “You have here my leadership team, just an indication of the seriousness that we take this issue, of the fact that we are concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism that is seen globally. “And unfortunately, there has been some reflection of that here in Australia. I was last week in Melbourne at the opening of the quite remarkable Holocaust Museum. “That was a reminder, a constant reminder, school children coming through there being reminded of where hatred can end. And it was important that the community are involved with but also that the border Australian community are involved with (it).” The families’ pleas come after a reported 69 hostages were freed by Palestinian militant group Hamas over the first three days of a mutually agreed truce, which began on Friday. In exchange, a total of 33 Palestinians were released from Israeli prisons on Monday, according to Israeli authorities. Qatari officials announced on Monday that the truce would be extended for another two days, raising hopes that more additional aid will flow into Gaza and the release of more hostages, prisoners and detainees than initially expected. The cease-fire has marked the longest break in fighting in the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7, when Hamas gunman and other armed groups launched an attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 240 people hostage.

4yo hostage’s incredible survival story,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/unthinkable-fouryearold-hostage-avigail-idan-freed-from-hamas-after-father-shot-dead-by-militants/news-story/35094a191181ba312034f8248fe1930f,"A four-year-old girl who crawled out from beneath the bloodied body of her father before being kidnapped by Hamas was one of the 17 hostages released by the terror group on Sunday. Avigail Idan’s parents were killed during an attack on the Kfar Aza kibbutz on October 7. A family member claimed her father had been holding her while he was shot dead by militants. She managed to survive and ran to hide with neighbours, but was hauled off by Hamas fighters shortly after. Avigail’s siblings, who hid in a closet for 14 hours, managed to escape capture and were later rescued. “We hoped and prayed today would come. There are no words to express our relief and gratitude that Avigail is safe and coming home,” said Liz Hirsh Naftali, Avigail’s great aunt, and cousin Noa Naftali in a statement. The pair thanked US President Joe Biden, the Qatari government, and others involved in securing Avigail’s release throughout the long-awaited ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Speaking on Monday, President Biden acknowledged the “terrible trauma” Avigail had endured while being held captive. “Today she’s free, and Jilly [first lady of the US Jill Biden] and I, together with so many Americans, are praying for the fact that she is going to be alright,” he said, adding that the four-year-old had “endured the unthinkable”. “We continue to press and expect that additional Americans will be released as well,” he said. “We will be not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones.” Fourteen of the 17 hostages released were Israeli, and three were Thai nationals. Under the truce, 50 hostages held by the militants will be exchanged for 150 Palestinian prisoners. A built-in mechanism extends it if at least 10 Israeli captives are released each day. Israeli leaders, however, have tempered hopes of a lasting halt to the offensive. “We continue until the end — until victory,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Gaza on Sunday. Wearing green military fatigues and surrounded by soldiers, he vowed to free all the hostages and “eliminate Hamas”. “Nothing will stop us, and we are convinced that we have the power, the strength, the will and the determination to achieve all the war’s goals.” In the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, residents received a text message from Israeli forces that said they know hostages are being held there. “The army will neutralise anyone who has kidnapped hostages,” the message said. Among the Israelis freed Sunday was Elma Avraham, 84, who was being treated at Soroka Medical Center, whose director Shlomi Kodesh said “she is in life-threatening condition” but being treated and would be moved to the intensive care unit. Also freed were sisters Ely, aged eight, and her sister Dafna, 15, whose father was shot dead during the Hamas attack. In the previous round of releases, there were smiles, kisses, and tears as Israeli hostage Sharon Avigdori, freed with her daughter Noam, 12, hugged her son and relatives at Sheba hospital, images from the government press office showed. On Sunday in Ramallah and Beitunia, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, white International Committee of the Red Cross buses delivered the freed prisoners as waiting crowds flew Hamas and Palestinian flags. Noorhan Awad, a female prisoner released Saturday, said that when she got out of the police car, “it was a great moment. Freedom is priceless.” Hamas’s military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said Sunday that its northern brigade commander Ahmed Al-Ghandour and four other senior leaders had been killed, without specifying when. The pause in fighting has allowed more aid to reach Palestinians struggling to survive with shortages of water and other essentials, but Adnan Abu Hasna, a spokesman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), warned of “unprecedented” humanitarian needs. “We should send 200 lorries a day continuously for at least two months,” he said. The UN estimates that 1.7 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been displaced by the fighting. – with AFP Relatives of victims and hostages of the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel have met with the Prime Minister after giving an emotional plea.

‘Think we’re human’: Twist as hostages freed,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/fourteen-more-israeli-hostages-released-by-hamas-on-sunday/news-story/c04b5c5894cd5822e47298b862699417,"Fourteen more Israeli hostages have been released by Hamas, with one detail in a chilling video released by the terror group sparking furious debate online. Nine children, four women and a Russian-Israeli were released Sunday by Gaza rulers Hamas, according to accounts given to AFP by their relatives, Israeli media and the Hostage Families Forum. The releases bring to 63 the total number of freed hostages from around 240 taken to Gaza after the unprecedented October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. The releases came following a Friday agreement between Israel and Hamas, which is supposed to last for four days and allow for 50 Israelis and 150 Palestinians to be freed. Thirteen Israeli hostages were released on Friday and the same number on Saturday, and in exchange Israel freed 39 Palestinian prisoners on Friday and a further 39 the following day. The Russian-Israeli freed on Sunday was not part of the truce deal, with Hamas saying it freed him “in response to the efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin”. The Palestinian militant group also freed three Thai nationals on Sunday. Fourteen Thais and one Filipino had already been released by Hamas outside the deal. Footage released by Hamas shows some of the hostages being released over the weekend smiling and waving — leading some Palestinian supportersto claimthe hostages had been “treated well”. One person hit back on X, “Because you can literally hear them telling them to keep waving in the video. Their whole family is still there and you think they are waving out of their own will?” Israel’s official X account wrote, “‘Keep waving.’ Hamas murdered their loved ones. Hamas violently kidnapped them from their homes. Hamas held them hostage for 49 days. ‘Now smile at the camera and wave goodbye so the world will think we’re human.’ Hamas is evil.” Last month, 85-year-old Israeli hostageYocheved Lifshitzwas seen in similar video released by Hamas shaking hands with her captor after she was freed. When later asked by reporters why she turned back to shake his hand, Ms Lifshitz said her captors had treated her with “with softness and supplied all our needs”. Following her release, the 85-year-old, who was freed along with 79-year-old Nurit Cooper, said she “went through hell” during her abduction but had been treated well while held captive in Gaza. The gunmen “beat me on the way, they didn’t break my ribs but hurt me very much”, she said. Mr Lifschitz said a paramedic regularly came to bring her medicine while held hostage and captives are being forced to sleep on mattresses in tunnels. “They gave us pitta bread, hard cheese, some low fat cream cheese and cucumber and that was our food for the entire day,” she said, adding that the militant group was “really prepared” for the situation. The Israeli hostages freed on Sunday are: Elma Avraham The 84-year-old artist was on the phone with a neighbour on October 7 when armed men burst into her home in Nahal Oz kibbutz at around 11am. “There’s a terrorist in my house!” she told the neighbour. Her son Uri Rawitz, with whom she had also spoken earlier, said Elma had not managed to lock the door to the safe room in her house. Uri later received a photo of his mother being taken away on a motorcycle by armed fighters with another hostage. Avraham’s second son, who also lives in Nahal Oz, escaped the attack. Aviva Siegel The 62-year-old was taken from her home in the Kfar Aza kibbutz along with her American husband Keith, 64, who is still being held. At the time of the early morning attack, the couple grabbed their phone and took refuge in the safe room of their home, still in their pyjamas, according to their son-in-law Yuval Baron. He toldThe Guardiannewspaper they had thought it was just another rocket attack, but soon afterwards Siegel and her husband were seen being taken away with other hostages by armed men. Schoolteacher Aviva was born in South Africa but moved to Israel when she was eight. The couple have four children and five grandchildren. Hagar Brodetz and her three children Avihai Brodetz said he was trying to defend Kfar Aza kibbutz when his wife Hagar, 40, and their three children were kidnapped. Several days later he found out they had survived the attack but had been abducted along with Abigail, a neighbour’s child who had taken refuge in their home. Ofri, the eldest child, marked her 10th birthday in captivity in Gaza. Her younger brothers Yuval and Oria are aged 8 and 4. Abigail After seeing her parents killed at Kfar Aza, Abigail, who holds US citizenship, took refuge with the Brodetz family, and was kidnapped with them. Michael and Amalya, her brother and sister, escaped the attack by hiding in a closet. Abigail had her 4th birthday in Gaza on Friday. Chen Almog-Goldstein and her three children A 48-year-old social worker, Chen Almog-Goldstein was kidnapped from Kfar Aza kibbutz with three of her four children: Agam, 17, Gal, 11, and nine-year-old Tal. The children’s father Nadav Goldstein and Yam, the eldest daughter, were killed in the attack. They are members of the family of Doron Almog, a former high-ranking army officer and current chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, a non-profit organisation that encourages Jews to immigrate to Israel. Five members of the Almog family were killed in an October 2003 suicide attack on the Maxim restaurant in Haifa which was claimed by Hamas ally Islamic Jihad. Sisters Ela and Dafna Ela, 8, and her sister Dafna, 15, were abducted from their father Noam Elyakim’s home in Nahal Oz kibbutz. The day after the attack, their mother Maayan Zin saw a photo on WhatsApp of Dafna “sitting in pyjamas on a mattress in Gaza with the comment ‘In prayer clothes it would be better’”. The bodies of the girls’ father, his partner Dikla and her son Tomer were found riddled with bullets in an empty lot. Before he was shot, 17-year-old Tomer had been told by militants to go door-to-door and speak in Hebrew to convince his neighbours to leave their shelters. Ela and Dafna also hold Hungarian nationality, according to media reports. Ron Krivoy The 25-year-old Russian-Israeli worked as a sound technician at the Tribe of Nova music festival attacked by the militants. Initially he managed to escape and hide in a ditch, his sister Julia told Israeli media, but by noon an Arab-speaking person was answering his phone. The youngest of three siblings, Krivoy was born in Israel, and, according to his father, had survived two car accidents and a fall into a sewer. Hamas said he was being released outside the truce deal with Israel, and “in response to the efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin and in appreciation of the Russian position in support of the Palestinian cause”.

‘Happened to men too’: Horror Hamas claim,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/face-of-an-angel-horrific-details-of-brutal-hamas-rapes-and-attacks-surface/news-story/13abb4fbb769ec63bfdaa53fd1b15de4,"WARNING: Disturbing content Horrific new Hamas attack stories have emerged, including the gang-rape of a woman who begged to be killed, as police investigate sexual crimes against both men and women. Yoni Saadon, a 39-year-old father of four, told the UK’sSunday Timesthat he is still haunted by the traumatic scenes he witnessed at the Nova Music festival, when the Palestinian fiends slaughtered at least 364 festival-goers. “I saw this beautiful woman with the face of an angel and eight or 10 of the fighters beating and raping her,” recalled Saadon, a foundry shift manager. “She was screaming, ‘Stop it already! I’m going to die anyway from what you are doing, just kill me!’ “When they finished, they were laughing, and the last one shot her in the head,” he said. Saadon said he witnessed the gruesome act after pulling over him the body of a slain woman who had also been shot in the head — and smearing her blood on himself so it looked like he, too, was dead. “I will never forget her face,” he said. “Every night I wake to it and apologise to her, saying, ‘I’m sorry.’” Saadon said he eventually joined others who had fled the site and hid in trees and bushes. That’s when he witnessed two more Hamas gunmen attack another young woman who was fighting back from being stripped, he said. “They threw her to the ground, and one of the terrorists took a shovel and beheaded her,” Saadon told the UK outlet. “And her head rolled along the ground. I see that head, too.” Saadon’s story is among the latest testimonies against Hamas accusing the terrorist group of orchestrating mass rapes during the October 7 attack that left more than 1,200 dead in Israel. Hamas has denied the allegations of sexual violence, although Israel Defense Forces sources claim that captured terrorists have said they were ordered to “dirty” or “whore” the women, according to the outlet. While investigations into the alleged sex assaults were initially hampered by the lack of physical evidence, as rape kits were not used on the survivors and corpse recovered within the first 48 hours, authorities have begun to get a clearer picture of the horrors, including rapes, in recent weeks. Yael Sherer, a spokeswoman for Israel’s Survivors of Sexual Violence advocacy group, said there is evidence of sexual violence against both men and women.“There was sexual violence and rape in these communities in the south of Israel... we have a few living survivors – not a lot – of both genders. It didn’t only happen to women, it happened to men as well,” she told BBC Radio 4. “Aside from finding bodies of people who were murdered, a lot of the bodies were mutilated... terrorists made sure to disgrace these people and dishonour them.” Meni Binyamin, the head of the International Crime Investigations Unit of the Israeli police, also confirmed “dozens” of women and men have been sexually abused. “We are investigating sexual crimes against both women and men perpetrated by Hamas terrorists,” he toldThe New York Times. “There were violent rape incidents, the most extreme sexual abuses we have seen, of both women and men. I am talking about dozens,” he told the publication. Israeli forensic teams who examined the bodies of the dead also said they found multiple signs of torture and other atrocities suffered by the victims. There also have been more than 1,500 heart-wrenching testimonials. “We saw many women with bloody underwear, with broken bones, broken legs, broken pelvises,” said a volunteer worker at the Shura military morgue named Shari tothe Washington Post. Shari, a 60-year-old architect from Jerusalem, said the opening of body bags from the massacre scenes was beyond traumatic. “They were all young women. Most in little clothing or shredded clothing and their bodies bloodied, particularly round their underwear, and some women shot many times in the face as if to mutilate them,” she said. “Their faces were in anguish and often their fingers clenched as they died. “Some bodies we took out had pretty pink or bright purple nails, and we would all pause and at that point many of us broke down,” she said. Officials noted that some of the bodies that arrived at Shura were so badly mutilated that it would be impossible to collect evidence of sexual assault. Haim Outmezgine, a senior member of ZAKA rescue services, a volunteer group that has collected the bulk of the dead so they may be buried, said Hamas crimes were evident by the remains of the late Israelis. “It was clear they were trying to spread as much horror as they could to kill, to burn alive, to rape — it seemed their mission was to rape as many as possible,” Outmezgine told the Times of the terrorists. Israeli police are currently building cases against Hamas terrorists who committed sexual assaults October 7, with the goal set to try the gunmen for rape. Along with the Israeli investigation into the rape claims, the United Nations — after nearly eight weeks of silence — has launched its own inquiry into the sexual violence Hamas is accused of committing. “There are numerous accounts of sexual violence during the abhorrent acts of terror by Hamas on 7 October that must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. “Gender-based violence must be condemned. Anytime. Anywhere,” he said. If you or someone you know is experiencing sexual abuse or family violence contact:   Don't go it alone.

Frightening act as US warship attacked,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/frightening-development-as-us-warship-attacked-in-red-sea-pentagon/news-story/6142fb5d79b07de88c967a6305cdb5fc,"A US warship and multiple commercial vessels were attacked in the Red Sea on Sunday, the Pentagon said — a frightening development ratcheting up maritime tensions in the Middle East during the Israel-Hamas war. The USS Carney — which previously shot down missiles and drones aimed at it as it escorted a commercial vessel through the war-torn region — was targeted along with at least two other commercial ships starting around 10am local time in an assault that lasted about five hours, the Pentagon and an unnamed US official said, according to The Associated Press. It was not immediately clear whether the American warship was struck. An update is expected soon from the United States Central Command (CENTCOM). “We’re aware of reports regarding attacks on the USS Carney and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and will provide information as it becomes available,” the Pentagon said in a statement. US officials did not identify where the military fire came from, although they added that the Carney shot down at least one drone Sunday. A White House official seemed to downplay the incidentto Fox News, saying that the American destroyer specifically did not come under attack in the Red Sea. The US official further told Fox News there are no injuries or damage to the USS Carney. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels — who have proclaimed they would attack ships on the Red Sea over Israeli’s ground incursion into Gaza — later acknowledged that they had targeted two Israeli commercial ships Sunday but did not mention the US Navy vessel. The rebel group claimed it had aimed for two commercial vessels, the Unity Explorer and Number Nine, because the ships “rejected warning messages” to get out of the region. In a statement posted on social media, the Houthis said they carried out an “operation against two Israeli ships in the Bab al-Mandab Strait”, a strategic waterway connecting the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, targeting one with a “missile and the second ship with a drone”. The group said it would continue to target Israeli vessels “until the Israeli aggression against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip stops”. At least one commercial vessel was known to be hit Sunday, a ship belonging to a British company owned by Danny Ungar, the son of billionaire Israeli shipping magnate Abraham “Rami” Ungar. Earlier on Sunday, maritime security firm Ambrey said, citing reports, that an unnamed Bahamas-flagged vessel was “struck by a rocket” while sailing south around 35 nautical miles off Yemen’s western coast. “The affected vessel was issuing distress calls relating to piracy/missile attack,” the UK-based company added. It noted reports that “an international naval asset in the vicinity of the incident” was likely proceeding to the ship’s location. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency, run by Britain’s Royal Navy, said it had received “a report of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) activity including a potential explosion … originating from the direction of Yemen”. It advised vessels in the area to “exercise caution”. Ambrey said the targeted vessel — en route from the United States to Singapore — had transited the Suez Canal five days ago. “The bulker was reportedly struck by a rocket and the crew retreated to the citadel,” it added. “Numerous vessels passed the incident location today but no unusual manoeuvres were observed.” The US Navy destroyer previously engaged with the rebel group on Wednesday when it took out a drone launched from Yemen, according to Fox News. The ship had been sailing near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait at the time of last week’s attack, but there was no damage to the Carney or its crew. Before last week’s attack, the USS Carney — an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer — had downed 15 drones and four cruise missiles in the Red Sea fired from Yemen. Sunday’s attack against the destroyer and other commercial ships operating in the Red Sea came as the British military said a suspected drone attack and explosion had been carried out in the area. Last week, Houthi rebels fired two ballistic missiles in the vicinity of the USS Mason as the warship responded to a distress call from a commercial tanker, the Central Park, being attacked by Somali pirates, the Pentagon said.

The Central Park was invaded by gunmen who fled when the Mason arrived. The Mason chased the attackers to the shores of Yemen. Houthi rebels fired the missiles near the Mason, with the explosives missing the ship and landing along the Gulf of Aden. The latest incidents come amid heightened tensions in the Red Sea and surrounding waters after Houthi rebels seized an Israeli-linked cargo vessel,the Galaxy Leader, last month. The vehicle carrier was seized on November 19 along with 25 crew members of various nationalities including Bulgarian, Filipino, Mexican and Ukrainian, but no Israelis were on board. Israel condemned the seizure as an “Iranian act of terror” although officials insisted the ship was British-owned and Japanese-operated. However, ownership details in public shipping databases associated the ship’s owners with Ray Car Carriers, which was founded by Rami Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel. The rebels still hold the vessel near the port city of Hodeida. Before reports of an attack on a US warship in the Red Sea on Sunday, former Obama CIA director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta spoke about how the US should respond to the increasing number of attacks by Iran’s proxy groups against US forces in the Middle East. “I would be much more aggressive,” Mr Panetta said on Saturday evening at the Reagan National Defense Forum. “I want to go after those who are firing missiles at our troops and make sure they understand that when they fire a missile — they are going to die.” The Houthis had not directly targeted the Americans for some time, further raising the stakes in the growing maritime conflict. In 2016, the US launched Tomahawk cruise missiles that destroyed three coastal radar sites in Houthi-controlled territory to retaliate for missiles being fired at US Navy ships, including the USS Mason, at the time. The spike in maritime incidents prompted G7 foreign ministers at a meeting earlier this week to urge the rebels to cease threats to international shipping and to release the Galaxy Leader. The Houthis have fired a series of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel since Hamas militants poured over the border into Israel on October 7, killing 1200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping about 240. In response, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas and began an air, sea and ground offensive that has killed more than 15,500 people, mostly women and children, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry claims. — withNY Post,Fox Newsand AFP To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout Horrific new Hasmas attack stories have emerged, as police investigate sexual crimes committed against both men and women.

Disturbing reason Gaza war set to escalate,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/why-the-israelhamas-conflict-is-set-to-escalate/news-story/834760ff1ac4f2fe00a5a78b15f7d186,"ANALYSIS Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for survival. Not Israel’s. But his own. And that has dire implications for the future of the Gaza Strip. His National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir this week threatened to “tear down” the far-right coalition government if Netanyahu did not immediately restart its assault on the Palestinian enclave. Ben-Gvir’s ultra-Orthodox Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party voted against the temporary truce that has resulted in the release of 97 hostages so far. And it continues to argue the highest possible priority should be the total destruction of Hamas and everything affiliated with the terror organisation. But Netanyahu has a problem. His Likud Party needed to form a unity government with the opposition – Benny Gantz’s centrist right National Unity – to bring stability and military experience into his emergency administration. But anew poll shows73 per cent of Israeli voters disapprove of the Prime Minister’s performance since the October 7 rampage by Hamas across southern Israel. That means Netanyahu needs to be seen as winning. And that likely means more of the same. Bombing. Shooting. Forced evictions. Just a lot more of it. “Between the (three) active corruption cases against him, the security failures on his watch, and the current war, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for him to remain in office,”argues Century International think tank analystDahlia Scheindlin. “But the larger question remains: Would his departure lead to a fundamental change in the direction of Israeli politics or policy?” ‘Only room for one sheriff in this town’ The current conflict’s underlying cause is no different from any other during the past 100 years. The first significant clash between Jewish Zionist settlers and indigenous Palestinian populations occurred in 1908. The situation has continued to escalate ever since. “Without a political horizon for Palestinians, Israel will remain a state built on a foundation of structural oppression, in which Palestinians are permanently subjugated, disregarded, and humiliated,” arguesCarnegie Middle East Centeranalyst Michael Young. “As Israelis come to realise that this situation is unsustainable, they will be left with one of two choices: either to conclude a durable peace agreement with the Palestinians, or to find a way of transferring by force Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to neighbouring Arab countries.” Young argues Israeli politicians are demonstrating an “apparent consensus” that there will be no return to previous policies of coexistence. “Therefore, the only solution left is to get rid of as many Palestinians in Israel’s vicinity as possible,” he states. Israel’s Ministry of Intelligence (headed by the Likud Party’s Gila Gamliel) hasprepared a planto do just that. It proposes a forced evacuation of “the Gazan population to Sinai” along with seizing a strip of Egyptian territory to create a “sterile zone” preventing their return. Possession as nine-tenths of the law … Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich this week declared the occupied West Bank to be home to‘two million Nazis’. “We will strengthen the settlement and cripple the Nazis wherever they are to ensure ‘never again!’” the Religious Zionism party leader added. It’s not the first time he’s advocated the forced displacement of Palestinian populations. His “Decisive Plan” of 2017 detailed plans for a dramatic expansion of illegal ultra-Orthodox settlements in the West Bank to ensure “the Arab dream of a state in Judea and Samaria is no longer viable.” Under his plan, indigenous Palestinians would be left with two options: “Those who wish to forego their national aspirations can stay here and live as individuals in the Jewish State,” or “Those who choose not to let go of their national ambitions will receive aid to emigrate to one of the many countries where Arabs realise their national ambitions, or to any other destination in the world.” Israel at war with itself Almost all of the blame for the October 7 disaster has been heaped on the shoulders of Netanyahu. And theevidence pointing to his failureskeeps mounting. At first, the embattled Prime Minister responded by insisting “now is not the time to apportion blame” – as all energy must be directed towards defeating Hamas. But that didn’t stop him fromdeflecting blame towards his senior security and intelligence officials. Now, he needs to keep his Likud Party’s far-right coalition with the Jewish Power and Religious Zionist Parties intact – while at the same time appeasing the centrist National Unity party. One way is to control the narrative. In October, a Likud Party proposal to impose sweeping new censorship controls over Israeli media failed. But Israeli law already provides strict “national security” intervention powers, as well as “criminal defamation” charges for “insulting public officials”. Now, Likud Party communications minister Shlomo Karhi wants stiff financial and legal penalties applied to the independent Israeli newspaper Haaretz. It’s been behind many of the damaging leaks pointing to the Netanyahu government’s failings that led to the deaths of 1200 during the October 7 assault. Karhi accuses Haaretz of “lying, defeatist propaganda” and “sabotaging Israel in wartime”. Conflict of interests Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox allies continue to make radical statements and demands. That’s undermining Israel’s international reputation. And Netanyahu’s standing among his own people. Jewish Power members of parliament shouted down hostage family members during a recent Knesset visit to express fears that legislation demanding a death penalty for terrorists would harm the chances of their abducted relatives being released. Jewish Power’s Tzvika Fogel dismissed their concerns, insisting “we do not need to feed these beasts” and accused them of being “Hamas mouthpieces”. Jewish Power then went on to be the only members of the Knesset to vote against the hostage release ceasefire. Now it’s insisting on more financial and military aid for a fresh round of evictions of Palestinians in the West Bank by its ultra-Orthodox supporters. If Netanyahu’s coalition fragments, only the Gantz National Unity Party has the numbers to form the core of a new government. “But as an IDF man, Gantz seems likely to view the Palestinian problem in much the same way – as a security threat to be contained rather than an acknowledgment of the Palestinian right to self-determination,” argues Scheindlin. “And if that is the case, for all its horror, October 7 seems likely to result in more of the same – including future cycles of misery on both sides.” Jamie Seidel is a freelance writer | @JamieSeidel Horrific new Hasmas attack stories have emerged, as police investigate sexual crimes committed against both men and women.

High Court exposes Aussie ‘warehouse’ issue,https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/can-no-longer-happen-legal-expert-reveals-how-high-courts-decision-ended-warehouse-issue-for-immigration-detention/news-story/e51e0135d3bccb608c2d3057f3aadc89,"An immigration law expert says a court decision which resulted in dozens of refugees – some of them serious criminals – being released into the community has ended a “warehouse-like arrangement” where the government would lock up “people they didn’t want to deal with”. Australia’s highest court overturneda decades-long precedent concerning the nation’s immigration detention scheme after it found a stateless asylum seeker and convicted child sex offender had been unlawfully detained. The resulting decision by the High Court justices led to dozens of other refugees being released from detention on strict conditions – causing an embarrassing headache for the government. Laws to tighten Australia’s immigration detention scheme and $255 million to beef-up border force arrangements were hurriedly rushed in as a result. In their unanimous reasons, published on Tuesday, the High Court justices found NZYQ had been unlawfully held in immigration detention as a result. The justices overturned a precedent set from a case known as Al-Kateb v Godwin (2004), which had underpinned the country’s migratory system in the decades since it was handed down. Immigration law expert Sanmati Verma said the decision involving NZYQ “ended a particular chapter in Australian history”. “For two decades after Al-Kateb was decided, successive governments became comfortable with holding people in immigration detention indefinitely, potentially for the rest of their lives,” Ms Verma, the acting legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) said. “It is important to remember that immigration detention isn’t prison. It was designed as a place of transit for people while their immigration status is resolved – that is, while a visa application was processed, or to remove them from Australia. “But instead, immigration detention became increasingly used as a warehouse for people the government simply didn’t want to deal with. “Because of this judgment, that can no longer happen. Earlier this year, the High Court found the stateless Myanmar man, who had been in immigration detention after serving jail time for the rape of a 10-year-old boy, had been unlawfully detained. The Rohingya Muslim, given the pseudonym NZYQ, arrived in Australia by boat in 2012 and was given a bridging visa in 2014. In 2016 he pleaded guilty in the NSW District Court to the rape of a child and was sentenced to five years’ jail with a non-parole period of three years and four months. NZYQ had been in immigration detention since 2018 but the court found by May 2023 he could not be removed from Australia. “Officers were then obliged to remove the plaintiff from Australia as soon as reasonably practicable. The plaintiff also requested to be removed to another country,” the High Court’s reasons state. “As at May 30, 2023, there was no real prospect of his removal from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future.” However, the justices warned release from unlawful detention “is not to be equated” with the right to remain in Australia. “Unless the plaintiff is granted such a right under the Migration Act, the plaintiff remains vulnerable to removal under s 198,” the reasons state. “Issuing of a writ of habeas corpus would not prevent re-detention of the plaintiff … in the future.” “Nor would (that prevent) detention of the plaintiff on some other applicable statutory basis, such as under a law providing for preventive detention of a child sex offender who presents an unacceptable risk of reoffending if released from custody.” The landmark ruling resulted in some eighty refugees who fell under similar categories being released from immigration detention. Ms Verma disputed reports that the High Court’s reasons had effectively green-lit a future government-led preventive detention scheme. “The High Court noted that its judgment did not prevent the plaintiff, at some hypothetical point in the future, from being detained under one of the existing schemes that prevent the release from criminal custody of certain sex offenders – provided that he fell within that scheme in the future,” she said. “Here, the Court was simply making the point about the possibility of future detention of the plaintiff, under already existing schemes. It certainly was not endorsing the creation of a new one.”Ms Verma said any future detention regimes would “need to comply” with constitutional limits articulated by the High Court. “The government is not free to detain non-citizens at will, or to create another punitive detention regime to replace the one that was struck down,” she said. In response to the High Court’s decision, the federal government flagged a “tough preventive” detention regime in response to the High Court’s decision. “We urge the parliament to support the government in protecting the Australian community,” Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said on Tuesday. A $255 million splash was allocated to “ensure the safety of the community” following the High Court’s decision. Of the funding, $150m will go to the Australian Border Force (ABF) for more staff in investigations, removal and surveillance functions. Federal police will get another $88m for regional response teams and staff to investigate visa breaches. The Opposition has since gone on the attack as to how serious criminals covered under the decision could be released on the streets. Documents tabled in the senate reveal 27 refugees in immigration detention fall under the category of “very serious” violent offences. The category includes “serious violent offences … (of) family/domestic violence, sexual or exploitative offences against women” and “very serious” crimes against children. One had spent up to 13 years in detention, the documents state. South Australian police have confirmed two registered child sex abusers are settling in the state after their release from detention. A surprise move from the Coalition had Penny Wong on her feet in the Senate warning she had messages to prove otherwise the party wrong.

‘Need you’: Gaza protesters’ new call,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/thousands-of-propalestine-protesters-rally-in-melbourne-and-sydney-calling-for-union-support/news-story/47bf2cf639ac4ffdcee08397363912ed,"Thousands of protesters have rallied in Sydney and Melbourne for the eighth week in a row, using the gathering to call for more support from the unions. Protesters filled Sydney’s Hyde Park while those in Melbourne took up the entire road in front of Flinders St Station on Sunday as they called on Australian leaders to call for peace and end the fighting in Palestine. A strong feature of the Melbourne rally was organisers calling on union executives, especially Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) secretary Sally McManus, to join the calls for peace. “The leaders of the ACTU, I want to tell them this, we want you to organise, organise and organise a union rally, one that bands them together,” Maritime Union of Australia WA Secretary Christy Cain called over the microphone. “Sally McManus we need you, we need you at these rallies, we need you calling for peace. “We need you to mobilise the masses around Australia and our connections around the world.” Protesters were heard chanting “peace is union business, peace is all our business”. While Ms McManus has not attended the rally, the ACTU says it “condemns attacks on civilians” and has called “for an end to the occupation of Palestine”. “The ACTU calls on the Australian Government to exercise all avenues of diplomacy to stop the bombing and ground assault by Israel into Gaza and call for an immediate ceasefire,” the union said in the weeks after the first attacks. “We reiterate the Australian union movement’s strong opposition to war, violence and racism, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.” “The killing of civilians & collective punishment must stop,” Ms McManus wrote on X, adding to the statement. Red, green white and black were overwhelming as hundreds of Palestinian flags were raised by protesters or worn around their shoulders. With tensions high on Australian streets in the fallout from the attack, protest organisers were quick to declare they were calling for peace rather than religious violence. “Once again lets make it really clear, this is not a war and more importantly this is not a war on Jews against the Muslims,” one protest organiser was heard saying over the microphone. “This has nothing to do with interfaith issues. We demand our leaders stop lying, we demand it.” Her call was met with cries of “shame” from the audience, directed toward politicians and other leaders. “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” was used as a rallying cry at both protests. The protest have occurred each week since Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1500 people and taking dozens of hostages. Many of the Israeli hostages have been freed in a prisoner swap amid the recent ceasefire, though both sides brushed off calls to renew the expired truce on Saturday. At least 240 people have been killed since the pause ended on Friday and the assault on Gaza’s north continued. Areas in Khan Younis in southern Gaza have come underfire over the weekend while sirens have sounded in Israel’s south as Hamas targeted Tel Aviv. More than 15,000 Palestinians including 6150 children have been killed in the conflict while Israel’s official death toll stands at 1200. Prayers in English and Arabic were read out, with the crowd falling silent as they wished safety to Palestinians under siege. Enormous Palestinian flags were seen at both protests, with Melburnians carrying theirs through the streets while Sydneysiders laid theirs on the ground. A large watermelon flag, used as a symbol of Palestinian resistance, with messages for Palestinians written onto it was also carried through the Sydney protest. “Where were you when people were being killed, where were you when hospitals were getting demolished, where were you when entire neighbourhoods were getting bombed. We’re going to remember, whatever you’re doing, keep doing it.” “Demand better!” A strong police presence could be seen at both rallies to keep things calm, with public order and riot squad officers, mounted police and other crew seen at the protests. The events remained calm on Sunday afternoon and no arrests were made at either rally not any incidents recorded.

Real reason Israeli hostages smiled at captors,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-behind-the-smiles-and-waves-of-the-hostages/news-story/bab518f3b1dd0a71a031504ef5c446d7,"They are images that are difficult to comprehend. Confronting footage shows two Israeli hostages – Sharon Avigdori and her 12-year-old daughter Noam – cheerily smiling and waving as they farewell their captors from inside a Red Cross vehicle. The pair were snatched from their homes in the deadly October 7 Hamas attacks where 1500 Israelis lost their life. Several members of their extended family, including Sharon’s brother, were reportedly murdered in the attacks. But when they were released late November their smiling faces masked the horror they had experienced. Middle Eastern expert Dr Ron Parat, a research associate with the Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation, told news.com.au the hostage release was an exercise in “propaganda”. “Hamas seeks to manipulate global public opinion by portraying itself as an organisation that upholds humanitarian values and distinguishes itself from groups like ISIS,” he said, speculating the hostages were made to wave as part of their release. However, Dr Parat says this “contradicts most of their actions”. “Hamas’ conduct lacks any semblance of humanitarians, and it disregards the liberal principles of preserving the dignity and lives of non-Muslim infidels”. Dr Parat said while Hamas is trying to reverse its images in the west of being the Palestinian ISIS it was a “classic PR stunt and a diversionary tactic”. “Hamas is trying to undermine the countless indisputable evidence, videos and photos and other pieces of information documenting in detail the atrocious and vile acts of murder rape, and massacre of children, elderly and people with disability and how Hamas killers burnt down whole families, including babies that were beheaded and much more.” Ghaith al-Omari, who has previously held several positions within the Palestinian Authority, (PA) told theABCthat what helps Hamas propagate their message is the fact that there’s a lot of mainstream media outlets that are willing to amplify it. “I’m talking specifically about the Arab world. Many people just buy the Hamas narratives and this is certainly what I see in Palestinian media. “I think their most sophisticated messaging goes specifically to the Arab audiences. That’s their primary audience,” he said. The Avigdori release is not the first propaganda video Hamas has released of hostages. An Israeli grandmother Yocheved Lifshitz famously gave her captor the sign of peace when she was released. Ms Lifshitz, a peace activist, declared that while she “went through hell” and was beaten on the day she was captured, she was treated “gently” and shown “care” over the two weeks she was held. She said a doctor was present and her captors “met all our needs” including for female hygiene. The diet she ate (cheese, cucumber and pita) was even the same as the captors, she noted. Whether it will work in changing perceptions is questionable. However, the video of the Avigdoris release on Al Jazeera’s Facebook page is filled with praise for the militants for their manners and good treatment of the hostages. Latest war developments This weekend Israel and Hamas brushed off international calls to renew an expired truce Saturday as air strikes pounded militant targets in Gaza and Palestinian groups launched volleys of rockets. Smoke again clouded the sky over the north of the Palestinian territory, whose Hamas government said 240 people had been killed since a pause in hostilities expired early Friday and combat resumed. In Israel, the military’s Home Front Command reported 40 missile alerts in the south and centre of the country, and the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad announced “rocket barrages” against multiple Israeli cities and towns including Tel Aviv. “Over 250 rockets have been fired at Israel since Friday morning,” Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told reporters. “The vast majority of those have not been successful in reaching their destination. Each one of those, obviously, is intended to kill Israelis.” According to the United Nations, an estimated 1.7 million people in Gaza - more than two-thirds of the population - have been displaced by eight weeks of war. Fadel Naim, chief doctor at the Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, said his morgue had received 30 bodies on Saturday, including seven children. “The planes bombed our houses: three bombs, three houses destroyed,” Nemr al-Bel, 43, told AFP, adding he had counted 10 dead in his family and “13 more still under the rubble”. The population is short of food, water and other essentials, and many homes have been destroyed. UN agencies have declared a humanitarian catastrophe, although some aid trucks did arrive Saturday. “Homes, hospitals and other infrastructure critical to the survival of the civilian population have suffered colossal destruction,” said Pascal Hundt, head of operations in Gaza for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). “Current conditions do not allow for a meaningful humanitarian response, and I fear will spell disaster for the civilian population,” he added. After the truce between Israel and Hamas expired on Friday, Israel had told NGOs not to bring aid convoys across the Rafah border crossing from Egypt, the Palestine Red Crescent Society had said. But on Saturday, the charity said its Egyptian colleagues had managed to send over a number of trucks.

Kibbutz Nir Oz wrote on its Facebook page that the deceased, who all lived in its community, included grandpa Aryeh Zalmanovich, 85, kindergarten instructor and mum of four Maya Goren, 56, and photographer Ronen Engel, 54,theNY Postreports. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed those deaths and that of Eliyahu Margalit, whose daughter was just released from Hamas custody Thursday, as reported inThe Times of Israel. Also among the hostages who did not survive their time being held captive by Hamas was Ofra Keidar, 70, who cared for her disabled adult daughter. She was abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7 during an early morning walk, the kibbutz announced. In a Facebook post Friday, Mor Metro-West High School in Ra’anana announced that one of its alumni, Guy Iluz, 26, who was kidnapped during the Supernova music festival near Re’im where more than 360 revellers were massacred by the terror group, had lost his life. Israel did not say how or when the six died but said they perished while being held in Gaza. “This comes after a team of Health Ministry experts, the [Abu Kabir Forensic Institute], the chief rabbi and Religious Affairs Ministry declared their deaths based on findings that were collected and intelligence,” said IDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. Mr Zalmanovich was a founder of the kibbutz and a father of two, according to a tribute post. “Aryeh was a man of the land all his life who was engaged in agriculture and field crops. A man of books and has a wide knowledge of history and knowledge of the country,” the post read. Ms Goren was a “diligent and dedicated kindergarten teacher and nanny” who “lovingly cared for the kibbutz children for many years”, another post said of the mother of four. Her husband, Avner Goren, was killed October 7, the day the war started, according to Kibbutz Nir Oz. During the Palestinian terror group’s surprise attack on Israel, kibbutzes such as Nir Oz were raided and many of their residents killed or taken hostage. Engel was a photographer, a volunteer for Magen David Adom, and a motorcycle enthusiast. His wife and two daughters were released from captivity earlier this week, the kibbutz said. Margalit was taken Oct. 7 when he went to go feed his horses in Nir Oz. His daughter, Nili Margalit, 41, was released from captivity Thursday, according to theTimes of Israel. Hamas released more than 100 hostages during the seven-day ceasefire in exchange for prisoners to be released from Israeli facilities.

‘Catastrophic’ scene after truce ends,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-resumes-military-operations-in-gaza-as-truce-expires/news-story/930be85a7e034caee6f9d7d8bca840ab,"Israel announced a resumption of combat in Gaza on Friday, carrying out a series of airstrikes across the territory, as a truce expired with no agreement to extend it. “Hamas violated the operational pause, and in addition, fired toward Israeli territory,” the Israeli military said. “The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) has resumed combat against the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip.” It said fighter jets were “currently striking Hamas terror targets” in Gaza, and AFP journalists reported airstrikes in the north and south of the territory. The Hamas-run health ministry said strikes killed three people in southern Gaza’s Rafah, where many Palestinians fled after being told by Israel to leave the north of the territory. A source close to Hamas told AFP that the group’s armed wing had received “the order to resume combat” and to “defend the Gaza Strip,” with heavy fighting reported in parts of Gaza City. The fighting resumed shortly after Israel’s military said it had intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza, the first from the territory since a missile launched minutes into the start of the truce. The United Nations human rights chief said the resumption of hostilities was “catastrophic”, with the situation now “beyond crisis point”. “The resumption of hostilities in Gaza is catastrophic. I urge all parties and states with influence over them to redouble efforts, immediately, to ensure a ceasefire -- on humanitarian and human rights grounds,” Volker Turk said in a statement. Sirens warning of potential missile fire sounded around several communities near Gaza in the hour after the fighting resumed, and Israeli authorities said they were restarting security measures in the area including closing schools. The renewed conflict dashed hopes for an extension of a seven-day truce during which dozens of hostages were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and more aid entered the ravaged Gaza Strip. On Thursday, US top diplomat Antony Blinken, meeting Israeli and Palestinian officials, called for the pause in hostilities to be extended, and warned any resumption of combat must protect Palestinian civilians. The truce had paused fighting that began on October 7 when Hamas militants broke through Gaza’s militarised border into Israel. The surprise attack killed 1200 people, mostly civilians, and militants kidnapped about 240, according to Israeli authorities. Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and unleashed an air and ground military campaign in Gaza that the Hamas government says has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians. During the truce brokered by Qatar, 80 Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. More than 20 foreigners, most of them Thais living in Israel, were freed outside the scope of the agreement. Overnight, six more Israelis, some holding dual nationality, were released, hours after two women were freed. That brought the total freed Thursday to eight, less than the 10 hostages a day the truce deal required Hamas to release. A source close to the militant group said it was counting two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday as part of the seventh batch. The release brought relief for Keren Shem, whose daughter Mia was among those freed. The family released footage showing Keren weeping with joy as she was informed by phone of her daughter’s imminent freedom. “Mia is coming back,” she cried out. Not long after the hostages arrived in Israel, the country’s prison service said another 30 Palestinian prisoners — 23 minors and seven women — had been freed. After meeting leaders in Israel and the occupied West Bank, Blinken said Washington wants “to see this process continue to move forward.” “We want an eighth day and beyond.” A source close to Hamas said the group backed another extension and mediators were working to prolong the pause, but the negotiations appeared to have failed. But Israel made it clear it viewed the truce as a temporary pause to secure the release of hostages. “We swore … to eliminate Hamas, and nothing will stop us,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video released by his office, after meeting with Blinken. His government has come under increasing pressure, however, to account for how it will protect civilians in the territory, which is under blockade, with no way for people to escape. Blinken warned that any resumed military operation by Israel “must put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians”. Specifically, Israel must “clearly and precisely” designate areas “in southern and central Gaza, where they can be safe and out of the line of fire”, he said. International bodies have called for more time to get medical supplies, food and fuel into Gaza, where an estimated 1.7 million people have been forced from their homes. The truce had allowed people to return to the ruins of their homes to pick through the rubble for remaining belongings and provided a sense of safety after weeks of daily bombardment. “We are afraid that the truce will end, so the problems and the bombings will start again,” Gaza City resident Mohamad Naasan told AFP on Thursday. “I hope that the truce resumes … so peace prevails, and we all go back home.” The violence in Gaza has also raised tensions in the West Bank, where nearly 240 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers since October 7, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry. TheNew York Timesreported overnight that Israeli authorities were aware Hamas was planning a major assault, and had obtained a blueprint for the attack, which the group appears to have largely followed on October 7. Intelligence and military officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, even after a signals analyst warned the group had carried out a training exercise in line with the plan, according to the report.

Israeli hostage totally different after release,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/frenchisraeli-hostage-mia-schem-released-by-hamas/news-story/8a643b8019e7acfdc6767a6f4c2bf5fe,"Israel has announced six more hostages have been released by Hamas and are “on their way to Israel” to return to their loved ones. Heartwarming footage from earlier today shows terrified hostage Mia Schem breaking down in tears as she hugged her mother and brother for the first time since being kidnapped 55 days ago,The Sunreports. Ms Schem, 21, was released alongside Amit Soussana, 40, on Thursday afternoon as six more hostages are now with the Red Cross according to the latest Israel Defense Forces (IDF) statement. The pair were paraded through a screaming crowd towards Red Cross workers. A harrowing video shows hollow-cheeked Ms Soussana and Ms Schem getting out of a vehicle and quickly being placed into a Red Cross car. Israel said the two women were handed over to IDF special forces and would be transferred to the Hatzerim Base for medical checks. The two ladies were the first hostages freed in this additional 24-hour truce period set early on Thursday morning. Talks of a further day extension are ongoing as fighting could start again Friday morning (Friday afternoon AEDT). Heart-wrenching footage showed Ms Schem’s mother breaking down in tears as she is being told her daughter is free. “Mia is coming back!” she shouts as she fights back tears. The Israeli-French woman was one of more than 190 people kidnapped by Hamas from the Supernova music festival on October 7. She was seen pleading to be released in a video released by the terror group 10 days after the atrocity. Ms Schem was shown receiving medical care for her wounded arm before telling the camera she was being held in Gaza and pleading for her release. In the one-minute-long video posted to Telegram, she said, “They are taking care of me, giving me medicine, everything is fine. “I only ask that they bring me home as soon as possible to my parents, to my siblings. “Get me out of here as soon as possible. Please.” Ms Schem also mentioned that she had just undergone a three-hour surgery in Gaza. Following the release of the sick footage, her devastated mum begged the world “help bring my baby home”. French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed her release. “Mia Schem is free,” he wrote on X. “I share this great joy with her family and all French people.” Macron also expressed his solidarity with all those who remain hostages of Hamas. “France is working with its partners to secure their release as soon as possible,” he said. The release of the eight new hostages comes as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement was extended by another 24 hours. The truce came just minutes before the six-day halt was set to end at 7am local time on Thursday. But shortly after the deal was agreed, Hamas carried out adeadly attackin Jerusalem leaving three civilians dead. The terror group’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for the shooting branding it “heroic” and saying it was in response to killing the “children and women in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank”. The group also called for an “escalation of the resistance”. Officials said the victims included a 24-year-old woman and a 73-year-old man while another eight people were wounded in the attack. Hamas appeared to admit breaking the truce with Israel which saw 10 hostages being released and allowing more aid to reach the enclave. A total of 14 more captives were released on Wednesday night as part of the truce deal. Five children and five women from Israel and four Thai hostages were freed just hours before the truce deal was set to expire. The group of 10 Israelis are made up of a Dutch child, three Germans and a woman from the US, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman Majed al Ansari said. Among those released was Rimon Kirsht, 36, who fearlessly stared down a Hamas thug as she was freed. Other hostages included a young girl with her pet dog, an elderly woman in a wheelchair and kids bandaged up.

An image of the distressed mum and her two red headed kids, which she held close to her as she was taken away by Hamas militants to Gaza, was seen around the world. Hamas killed at least 1200 people in Israel and took more than 200 hostage. Israel’s subsequent war against Hamas in Gaza is estimated to have killed 15,000 Palestinians. While Hamas has been releasing hostages for days – mostly women and children – the Bias family has not been among them. Hamas said that Kfir, Ariel and Shiri were passed to another militant group which took them to southern Gaza away from the centre of the fighting. However, it has now said the trio were killed in an Israeli air strike prior to this week’s truce. But Israel has said it has received no confirmation or proof of the Bibas’ deaths. Ms Bibas’ aunt Michal Keshet lives in Sydney with her husband Eltan and daughter Shanee. “We have not had official word yet … we don’t know what is true and what isn’t,” Ms Keshet’s husband Eltan toldThe Daily Telegraph. “Right now we are doing what we can to stay sane … it’s devastating”. Michel, Eltan and Shanee have posted images of them holding pictures of the Bibas family saying “We are waiting for you. Please come home safe”. The Bibas’ are citizens of the US, Germany, the Netherlands and Russia. The Israeli Defence Force said it was investigating the reports of the three deaths. “Hamas is wholly responsible for the security of all hostages in the Gaza Strip. Hamas must be held accountable,” it said in a statement. Hamas has released more than 100 of the 200 plus hostages it snatched on October 7. If the swaps of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel continue then all the women and children held by Hamas would be released within days. Egypt, Qatar and the US, the key nations talking to Israel and Hamas, have urged the current truce is extended so more hostages can be freed and humanitarian assistance can be ferried into Gaza.

Gunmen kill three in major city terror attack,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/gunmen-kill-3-in-jerusalem-police-say-as-truce-extended/news-story/3db620e59607259a5f96122cbe0911ae,"Warning: Graphic Gunmen killed three people and wounded several more in Jerusalem on Thursday, Israeli police said, in an attack shortly after an truce in the Israel-Hamas war was extended. Police said the two assailants from annexed east Jerusalem opened fire on people near a bus stop on the western side of Jerusalem, where there are no checkpoints guarding the entrance to the city. “Two terrorists arrived in a car, one of them armed with an M-16 and the other with a pistol,” and opened fire, Jerusalem police chief Doron Torgeman told reporters at the scene. The two attackers “were neutralised on the scene shortly after the attack by two off-duty IDF (Israeli army) soldiers and another civilian who fired at them”, police said in a statement. “A police search of the terrorists’ car revealed ammunition and weaponry,” the statement said, adding that three of the wounded were in serious condition. Footage circulating on social media and broadcast on Israeli television showed two men emerging from a white car and opening fire on people waiting for a bus, before security personnel and bystanders intervene and return fire. AFP was not able to immediately verify the footage. The Magen David Adom emergency service said one of the fatalities was a 24-year-old woman. The shooting came shortly after a truce pausing fighting in the Gaza Strip between Hamas and Israel was extended for a seventh day, moments before it had been due to expire. The war began after Hamas militants poured over the Gaza border with Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping about 240, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel vowed to crush Hamas and unleashed a relentless air and ground offensive that the Hamas government in Gaza says has killed nearly 15,000 people in the Palestinian territory, also mostly civilians. Since the war broke out, there has been an uptick in deadly violence in east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. On October 6, an Israeli border police officer died after being stabbed by a Palestinian assailant at a police station in east Jerusalem. Ten days later, an Israeli soldier died after being shot in an attack on a checkpoint on the eastern side of Jerusalem at the entrance to a tunnel linking the West Bank with the city. Another five Israeli security personnel were also wounded, with Israeli police shooting dead all three assailants. That attack was claimed by the armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Horrific new Hasmas attack stories have emerged, as police investigate sexual crimes committed against both men and women.

Shock update on Israel-Hamas truce,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/mediator-qatar-confirms-israelhamas-truce-will-be-extended/news-story/b99071670c31431152da898b4a18d5e3,"A truce between Israel and Hamas will be extended by one day, mediating nation Qatar confirmed on Thursday. The announcement was made as a six-day humanitarian pause in Gaza was set to end. “Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached an agreement to extend the humanitarian pause in the Gaza Strip for an additional day under the existing conditions, which are a cessation of all military activities and the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza,” Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Majed Al Ansari said in a statement. He added that the truce would operate “within the framework of the joint mediation of the State of Qatar with the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United States of America”. Qatar has been engaged in intense negotiations, with support from Egypt and the United States, to extend the truce in Gaza, which was due to end on Thursday morning. Minutes before the halt in fighting was due to expire at 0500GMT, Israel’s military said the “operational pause” would be extended, without specifying for how long. “In light of the mediators’ efforts to continue the process of releasing the hostages and subject to the terms of the framework, the operational pause will continue,” it said. Hamas meanwhile said there was an agreement to “extend the truce for a seventh day,” without further details. Qatar, which has led the truce negotiations, confirmed the pause had been extended until Friday. There had been pressure to extend the pause to allow more hostage releases and additional aid into devastated Gaza, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arriving in Israel for talks Wednesday night. The truce has brought a temporary halt to fighting that began on October 7 when Hamas militants poured over the border into Israel, killing 1200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping about 240, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s subsequent air and ground campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to Hamas officials, and reduced large parts of the north of the territory to rubble. The truce agreement allows for extensions if Hamas can release another 10 hostages a day, and a source close to the group said Wednesday that it was willing to prolong the pause by four days. But with just an hour to go before the truce was due to expire, Hamas said its offer to free another seven hostages, and hand over the bodies of another three it said were killed in Israeli bombardment, had been refused. Both sides had earlier said they were ready to return to fighting, with Hamas’s armed wing warning its fighters to “maintain high military readiness... in anticipation of a resumption of combat if it is not renewed,” according to a message posted on its Telegram channel. IDF spokesman Doron Spielman said troops would “move into operational mode very quickly and continue with our targets in Gaza,” if the truce expired. Sustained humanitarian truce Overnight, 10 more Israeli hostages were freed under the terms of the deal, with another four Thai hostages and two Israeli-Russian women released outside the framework of the arrangement. Video released by Hamas showed masked gunmen handing hostages to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Among those freed was Liat Beinin, who also holds American citizenship, and works as a guide at Israel’s Holocaust museum Yad Vashem. US President Joe Biden said he was “deeply gratified” by the release. “This deal has delivered meaningful results,” he said of the truce. Shortly after the hostages arrived in Israel, the country’s prison service said 30 Palestinian prisoners had been released, including well-known activist Ahed Tamimi. Since the truce began on November 24, 70 Israeli hostages have been freed in return for 210 Palestinian prisoners. Around 30 foreigners, most of them Thais living in Israel, have been freed outside the terms of the deal. Israel has made clear it sees the truce as a temporary halt intended to free hostages, but there are growing calls for a more sustained pause in fighting. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanded a “true humanitarian ceasefire”, warning Gazans are “in the midst of an epic humanitarian catastrophe.” And China, whose top diplomat Wang Yi was in New York for Security Council talks on the violence, urged an immediate “sustained humanitarian truce”, in a position paper released Thursday. Families anxiously wait for news The hostage releases have brought joy tinged with agony, with families anxiously waiting each night to learn if their loved ones will be freed, and learning harrowing details from those who return. Four-year-old Abigail was captured after crawling out from under the body of her father, killed by militants, covered in his blood, her great aunt Liz Hirsh Naftali said. “It’s a miracle,” she said of the little girl’s survival and release. However Israel’s army also said Wednesday it was investigating a claim by Hamas’s armed wing that a 10-month-old baby hostage, his four-year-old brother and their mother had all been killed in an Israeli bombing in Gaza. Israel pounded the Gaza Strip relentlessly before the truce, forcing an estimated 1.7 million people to leave their homes and limiting the entry of food, water, medicine and fuel. Conditions in the territory remain “catastrophic”, according to the World Food Programme, and the population faces a “high risk of famine”. Israeli forces targeted several hospitals in northern Gaza during the fighting, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. The spokesman for the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry, Ashraf al-Qudra, told AFP Wednesday that doctors found five premature babies dead in Gaza City’s Al-Nasr hospital, which medical staff had been forced to abandon. The truce has allowed those displaced to return to their homes, but for many there is little left. “I discovered that my house had been completely destroyed – 27 years of my life to build it and everything is gone,” said Taghrid al-Najjar, 46, after returning to her home in southeastern Gaza. The violence in Gaza has also raised tensions in the West Bank, where nearly 240 Palestinians have been killed by either Israeli soldiers or settlers since October 7, according to the Palestinian health ministry. An eight-year-old boy and a teenager were the latest deaths in the occupied territory, with Israel saying it “responded with live fire... and hits were identified” after suspects hurled explosive devices towards troops.

‘Cruel’: Horror update on baby Hamas hostage,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hamas-claims-baby-hostage-kfir-bibas-fouryearold-brother-and-mum-killed-in-idf-shelling/news-story/8f2c85d22b8270cdbcf609afbf60947e,"The youngest Israeli hostage held by Hamas, his four-year-old brother and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing on the Gaza Strip, the terror group’s military arm said on Wednesday without evidence. Israel said it’s looking into the Al Qassam Brigades’ Telegram announcement about the deaths of 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, four-year-old Ariel and 32-year-old Shiri Silverman-Bibas,theNY Postreports. “The terrorist organisation Hamas continues to act in a cruel and inhuman manner,” the IDF said in a statement. “IDF representatives spoke with the members of the Bibas family, informed them of the claim, and are accompanying them at this time. The IDF is examining the reliability of the information. The responsibility for the safety of all the hostages in the Gaza Strip rests fully with the terrorist organisation Hamas. Hamas endangers the hostages, including nine children. Hamas is required to immediately return them to Israel.” The three had been abducted along with patriarch Yarden from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, and the photogenic, red-headed youngsters, known affectionately as “The Reds”, had become something of a symbol of the terror attack’s brutality. On Tuesday, Israeli officials announced that Hamas had handed the family over to anotherPalestinian factionand said they were being held in Khan Younis, a city in the southern Gaza Strip. Despite repeated pleas from extended relatives and IDF officials, the Bibas family was not on the list of hostages expected to be released Wednesday, according to CNN. Hamas has released 70 Israeli hostages and 30 hostages of other nationalities, out of a total of some 240, since a temporary truce was brokered last week. Israel claimed on Tuesday that Hamas violated “the framework of the operational pause” by detonating explosives and opening fire on troops in two different locations in northern Gaza. There were no immediate reports of shellings in Khan Younis. Hamas had previously reported 77-year-old hostage Hannah Katzir to have been killed in captivity by an Israeli attack, but Ms Katzir was released last week, alive and well. The Bibas children’s aunt, Ofri Bibas, on Tuesday called for the family to be released before the temporary ceasefire ended on Wednesday. “We call upon the Israeli government and Qatar and Egypt, everybody who is involved in these negotiations and this deal, to do whatever they can to include our family in this deal and to release them as soon as possible,” Ms Bibas told theTimes of Israel. “I hope they don’t hold them as a trophy.” Eylon Keshet, Kfir’s father’s cousin, asked reporters Tuesday, “Is baby Kfir the enemy of Hamas?” This article originally appeared onNY Postand was reproduced with permission Horrific new Hasmas attack stories have emerged, as police investigate sexual crimes committed against both men and women.

‘Abhorrent’: Tough new laws on Nazi symbols,https://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/sa-parliament-to-vote-on-new-laws-banning-nazi-symbols-salutes/news-story/4964cebbcda0441b2d82c509202c7a9d,"Another state is moving to ban Nazi symbols and gestures as Australia grapples with how to attack and beat back a sudden nationwide rush in anti-Semitism. South Australian Attorney-General Kyam Maher said his government would introduce legislation into parliament this week to specifically prohibit public displays of swastikas or the Nazi salute. The move follows NSW and Victoria, which have also banned the notorious signals of German fascism, and comes as the state suffers a spate in anti-Semitic animosity. Adelaide Holocaust Museum chair Greg Adams said South Australia’s Jewish community was “feeling it on the ground”. “Anti-Semitism is a real threat, the rise of far-right nationalism is a real threat and needs to be dealt with appropriately,” he said. Late last year, he said four people stood outside the museum and performed Nazi salutes, which Mr Adams says was used as part of a “recruitment” campaign for neo-Nazis. The proposed legislation would impose fines of up to $20,000 or one year in jail for the offences. “We have seen increased activity from the neo-Nazi movement around the country which is totally unacceptable,” Mr Maher said. “This Bill will impose tough new penalties on those who seek to promote this abhorrent ideology and give the police the powers they need to ensure prohibited symbols are swiftly removed.” The new law contains protections for “innocent” uses of Nazi symbols, including their good faith use in academia, education and the arts. A wave of anti-Semitism has washed over Australia since October 7 when Islamic terror group Hamas butchered hundreds of Israeli civilians, including the elderly, women and children, in a surprise attack on the Jewish state. The terrorists kidnapped 240 Israelis, holding them hostage in Gaza. Israel responded with force, bombing the densely populated slip of land. The bombing campaign, though directed at Hamas fighters, has resulted in thousands of Palestinian deaths, including children and Palestinian men and women who are not associated with Hamas. The war has triggered furious passions in Australia, with multiple pro-Palestine rallies in all major cities across the country. Some of the rallies have exhibited anti-Semitic sentiments, including a rally at the Sydney Opera House two days after the Hamas attack during which a group of men chanted “f**k the Jews” and “gas the Jews”. On October 13, three men were arrested after allegedly performing Nazi salutes outside Sydney’s Jewish Museum. The men have pleaded not guilty to the charges of behaving in an offensive manner near a public place/school and knowingly displaying by public act a Nazi symbol without excuse. Holocaust survivor Andrew Steiner welcomed the new laws and said he had seen “concerning cracks” begin to appear in Australian society. “We are extraordinarily successful multicultural, homogeneous society,” he said in Adelaide on Wednesday. “However, there are unfortunate, concerning cracks which have appeared and need to be dealt with. “But our emphasis here at the museum is one of being caring, harmonious, compassionate, everybody historically equal, there are no differences, we are all totally the same as human beings.” The teen who allegedly caused the death of a 19-year-old girl in a highway car crash will spend Christmas with his family as he considers how to plead. The family has spoken out about their grief after learning their grandmother had allegedly been murdered by their grandfather. South Australian police have confirmed two registered child sex abusers are settling in the state after their release from detention.","November 29, 2023 - 12:44PM"
Hamas’ sick trade of 10-month-old baby,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-gaza-war-hamas-sick-trade-of-10monthold-baby-to-another-palestinian-terror-group/news-story/328aafa4c3ac31df6b1ad696e38601f7,"A 10-month-old Israeli boy — the youngest hostage captured by Hamas — and his family have been handed off to another Palestinian terror group in what one relative decried as “just more psychological torture.” An Arabic spokesman for the Israel Defence Force, Avichay Adraee, revealed Monday night that the Bibas family, including infant Kfir, his 4-year-old brother, Ariel, and their parents, were being held captive in the southern city of Khan Younis following the disturbing move. “In Hamas prison, infants under one-year-old who have not seen the light of day for more than 50 days are detained,” Adraee wrote in a post to X. “Hamas treats them as if they were spoils and sometimes hands them over to other terrorist organisations in the Gaza Strip. “For example, the Bibas family, the two red-haired children ‘The Reds,’ who were kidnapped from their home in Nir Oz by a member of the Hamas terrorist organisation and are being held in the Khan Yunis area by one of the Palestinian factions.” Khan Younis, where the Bibas family is reportedly being held, is expected to be targeted by Israel once the temporary ceasefire expires,The Telegraphreported, raising speculation that Hamas strategically transferred the infant to the city as a means to extend the truce. The four Bibas family members were among the 240 hostages taken by Hamas during the group’s deadly October 7 attack on Israel. Video shared on social media showed kindergarten teacher Shiri Silberman-Bibas clutching her sons as the family was abducted. The family, including husband and father Yarden Bibas, was bunkered down in a safe room when the terrorists descended. The children’s aunt, Noah Abrahams, described the latest development in the family’s captivity as “just more psychological torture,” according to The Telegraph. “We are experiencing moments of great uncertainty. The realisation that we will not get the hug we wished for leaves us speechless,” the family reportedly said in a statement. On Monday, Israel and Hamas agreed to extend their temporary truce for two more days. The extension will follow the same rules previously laid out for the initial four-day deal, meaning the terrorist group will release at least 20 more hostages in exchange for the additional two days of peace. Hamas kidnapped about 240 people when it raided southern Israel on 7 October, and killed 1,200, most of them civilians, Israel says. Hamas released 11 hostages on Monday, bringing the total released since Friday, when a pause in hostilities began, to 69. Israel has released 150 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in return. The Israeli government says the truce could be extended if at least 10 Israelis are released daily, but it has also vowed to wipe out Hamas and insists the deal is only temporary.

Reason behind Wong’s trip to Israel,https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/penny-wong-on-mission-to-israel-middle-east-in-coming-weeks/news-story/30c2572d8e3bfaa6ab49c065b819c708,"Penny Wong will visit Israel within a matter of weeks as the conflict with Hamas continues. In a statement from the Foreign Minister’s office, a spokesperson confirmed an official visit would take place in the new year. “Australia has been working with countries that have influence in the region to help protect and support civilians, to help prevent the conflict from spreading and to reinforce the need for the just and enduring peace that all of us want,” they said. But the opposition has criticised the timing, claiming the visit should have happened much sooner. “We want to see it happen and we want to see it happen as quickly as possible,” Coalition foreign affairs spokesman Simon Birmingham told Sky News. “But it really is a case that the Albanese government has taken a very long time to do this and far longer than comparable or like-minded nations.” Senator Birmingham, who is leading a bipartisan ­delegation to Israel next week, also questioned why Prime Minister Anthony Albanese would not be joining Senator Wong on the visit. Hamas’s cross-border attack on October 7 killed more than 1200 people and another 240 were taken hostage. But continued bombardment by Israeli forces on Gaza have killed at least 17,000, according to figures released by the Gaza Health Ministry. Australia has consistently supported Israel’s right to defend itself but argued the way it does so matters. On Thursday, Senator Wong described the end of the week-long pause in hostilities as a “grave setback”. Assistant Foreign Affairs Minister Tim Watts will lay the groundwork for the ministerial dialogue when he travels to Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Qatar and Egypt next week. Mr Watts will meet with victims of the Hamas attack, Israeli officials as well as members of the Palestinian Authority and UN representatives. “I will continue Australia’s advocacy for a just and enduring peace through a two-state solution and discuss the next steps in a political process toward that goal,” he said in a statement. “We want to see continued steps towards a sustained ceasefire, but it cannot be one-sided.” Senator Birmingham called the visit necessary after Israel updated its travel warnings for its citizens to Australia, citing rising levels of anti-Semitism. The confirmation of the minister’s trip comes as 1000 people gathered at Moriah College in Sydney for a vigil marking the two-month anniversary of the Hamas attacks and the first night of Chanukah. Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin told attendees they could not “control” or “reason” with those who spread hate against Jewish people. “The power of our minds and the fullness of our hearts is no match for their stupidity,” he said. “But you must accept that the price of being a Jew, the price of a Jewish state, the price of our survival and our victory is to be hated. “It is a small price to pay for the greatest blessing we can receive. Live proudly as a Jew. Take strength and joy and meaning from its abundant beauty. “Do not ask for the understanding of those who despise you.” News a fifth immigration detainee has been arrested has sparked fresh concerns about the release of 150 people following a bombshell High Court ruling.

The group turned themselves in after being pushed back by the advancing Israel Defense Forces (IDF) near Jabaliya,theTimes of Israelreports. Local Channel 13 showed images of the surrender, which featured dozens of men lined up on a street, sitting in rows with their hands over their heads. Many of the men were stripped to just their underwear as the IDF troops lined up others to proceed farther down the closed-off road,theNY Postreports. In one clip, the Hamas members could be seen in the back of an Israeli military vehicle. Channel 13 reporter Almog Boker estimated that more than 100 Hamas fighters turned themselves in, the largest group to surrender to the IDF since Israel began its incursion into the Palestinian enclave. Israel’sKan News, however, reported that the group of men were detained before the IDF could verify if they were all in fact members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The New Arab, a Qatari-owned news outlet based in London, alleged that one of the men seen in the footage was Diaa Al-Kahlot, one of its correspondents reporting from Gaza. Senior Hamas leader Osama Hamdan claimed that the people arrested in the video were unarmed civilians who were not affiliated with the terror group, Arabic broadcasterAl Araby reports. The IDF has yet to comment on the arrests in Jabaliya. The northern Gaza city has seen some of the most intense fighting in recent days as the IDF raided Hamas’ general security headquarters in the area. There, Israeli troops found weapons, equipment and intelligence documents belonging to the terrorist group, officials said. The operation came after the IDF encircled the Jabaliya refugee camp, one of the largest in the region that had been besieged by nearby air strikes and gunfire. The US has previously demanded an explanation as to why Israel conducted bombardments at the camp that reportedly killed dozens. Israel has defended its attacks near the camp as a means to reach the headquarters in Jabaliya. Thursday saw further fighting in northern Gaza as members of the IDF’s Border Defense Corps located a group of Hamas fighters approaching Israeli troops. The terrorists were seen opening fire at the IDF soldiers, with some of the Hamas operatives armed with RPGs. The Defense Corps unit was able to call in an air strike that killed all the Hamas fighters, the IDF said. After nearly two months of advancing across northern Gaza, the IDF has demolished a majority of the terrorist infrastructure and has now ramped up its incursion into the south, with the fighting focused on Khan Younis, the enclave’s second largest city.

Issam Abdallah, 37, was killed instantly in the strike on October 13 in the south of the country near the Israeli border. The others present -- two other Reuters journalists, two from Al Jazeera, and two from AFP -- were all injured. AFP photographer Christina Assi, 28, was seriously wounded, later had a leg amputated and is still in hospital. Independent investigations by both rights groups concluded that the first strike that killed Abdallah and severely wounded Assi was most likely a tank round fired from Israel. Amnesty said the strikes “were likely a direct attack on civilians that must be investigated as a war crime”. “Those responsible for Issam Abdallah’s unlawful killing and the injuring of six other journalists must be held accountable,” said Aya Majzoub, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. “No journalist should ever be targeted or killed simply for carrying out their work. Israel must not be allowed to kill and attack journalists with impunity.” HRW said the two Israeli strikes “were apparently deliberate attacks on civilians, which is a war crime”. Under international humanitarian law, “it is forbidden in any circumstances to carry out direct attacks against civilians”, it said. The group’s investigation indicated that the journalists were “well removed from ongoing hostilities, clearly identifiable as members of the media, and had been stationary for at least 75 minutes before they were hit”. Amnesty said images it verified showed “the seven journalists were wearing body armour labelled ‘press’, and that the blue Reuters crew car was marked ‘TV’ with yellow tape on its hood”. “The evidence strongly suggests that Israeli forces knew or should have known that the group that they were attacking were journalists,” HRW’s Lebanon researcher Ramzi Kaiss said. “This is an unlawful and apparently deliberate attack on a very visible group of journalists.” Since October 7, 63 journalists and media workers -- 56 Palestinian, 4 Israeli, and 3 Lebanese -- have been killed, the Committee to Protect Journalists says.

It’s half the size of an international airport. Its critical infrastructure has already been bombed. Now it’s supposed to feed, house and medically treat 1.9 million refugees. And it’s just triggered an international crisis. The chief of the United Nations says it isn’t enough. “We are simply unable to meet those in need inside Gaza”, Secretary-General António Guterressaidwhile invoking an emergency clause of the UN charter Thursday morning. He said the scenario being imposed on the Gaza Strip posed “a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system”. This, he added, would soon cause “public order to completely break down due to desperate conditions, rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible”. Israel reacts with outrage “Guterres’ tenure is a danger to world peace,” Israel’s Foreign Minister asserted on Thursday morning. “The call for a ceasefire in Gaza constitutes support of the Hamas terrorist organisation and an endorsement of the murder of the elderly, the abduction of babies and the rape of women. “Anyone who supports world peace must support the liberation of Gaza from Hamas.” At the centre of the diplomatic crisis is Israel’s attempt to relocate the population of Gaza to the tiny coastal town of al-Mawasi. Its normal population is less than 2000. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s last remaining “humanitarian shelter” encompasses just a small part of this village that had been surrounded by a cluster of illegal settlements before occupational forces withdrew in 2005. That’s less than half of the 17 square kilometres of the Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport. And the IDF is delivering its warnings to Palestinian refugees by SMS and QR codes, which some may never receieve as the enclave’s electrical and communications infrastructure is hanging by a thread. “This is an apocalyptic situation now because these are the remnants of a nation being driven into a pocket in the south,” UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs Martin Griffiths warned overnight. “Once again, nowhere is safe in Gaza,” asserted theWorld Health Organisation (WHO). “We have seen what happened in northern Gaza. This cannot be the blueprint for the south.” Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide The Netanyahu government last weekend ordered the IDF to send its tanks and troops into the previous designated “safe zone”, the southern half of the 360 sqkm Gaza Strip. Its border with Egypt remains closed despite Israeli appeals. Cairo says it refuses to take responsibility for the unfolding humanitarian disaster. Now the IDF is engaged in heavy fighting in and around the enclave’s second-largest city, Khan Younis. It had been the focus of international relief efforts over the past two months – despite regular Israeli bombing. “On a recent visit to Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, the WHO team described the situation inside as catastrophic, with the building and hospital grounds grossly overcrowded with patients and displaced people seeking shelter,” the relief agency says. The WHO adds more than 80 per cent of the Gaza Strip’s population – some 1.9 million people – have been forced out of their homes. Some 1.1 million of these have sought refuge in UN shelters. The first round of Israeli evacuation orders issued this week for part of Khan Younis and camps to its east affected some 370,000 people. This had previously been part of an IDF-declared safe zone. These civilians must now flee again. And the WHO has been ordered to abandon its own facilities inside Gaza. “This morning, WHO was contacted with advice to move as many medical supplies as possible from a warehouse in Gaza, situated in an area ordered to be evacuated,” it said. “Access to storage could become challenging over the coming days due to ground operations.” Unrestrained anger UNICEF spokesperson James Elder says even if all of al-Mawasi was included inside the IDF “safe zone”, it wouldn’t be big enough. “It’s about 4 per cent of Gaza, and it would require 80 per cent of the population to be there,” he told Sky News. “If you are going to forcibly evacuate people, you cannot send hundreds of thousands [of] people to places where there is no water and no toilets. I genuinely mean no toilets. Every corner I had turned to, there was another 5000 people who would appear overnight. They don’t have a single toilet. They don’t have a drop of water.” The Netanyahu government is unhappy with the UN voicing its concerns. On Monday, UN Humanitarian Coordinator Lynn Hastings said that “the conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist”. She warned that the al-Mawasi plan was “an even more hellish scenario … one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond”. On Wednesday, Israel revoked her visa. “We will no longer be silent in the face of the bias of the UN!” foreign minister Eli Cohen proclaimed onsocial media. “Someone who did not condemn Hamas for the brutal massacre of 1200 Israelis … but instead condemns Israel, a democratic country that protects its citizens, cannot serve in the UN and cannot enter Israel!” Israel had previously threatened to revoke UN visas after Guterres pointed out how the October 7 Hamas terror attack did not happen “in a vacuum” and that Palestinians had been “subject to 56 years of suffocating occupation”. More than 130 UN relief agency staff have so far been killed in Israeli bombings since the war began. Emergency appeal UN Chief Guterres said he was invoking Article 99 of the UN Charter, which empowers him to address the Security Council with any matter he believes “may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security.” He says he felt compelled to do so “given the scale of the loss of human life in Gaza and Israel in such a short amount of time”. An outraged Israel launched its assault on Gaza after a murderous rampage by Hamas militants took the Netanyahu government by surprise, with many of the troops assigned to defend the border with Gaza repositioned to protect illegal settlers in the occupied West Bank. Some 1200 people were killed on October 7, including 33 children. About 130 remain hostages. Guterres called the Hamas attack “brutal” and “appalling”. And he repeated calls for all hostages to be “immediately and unconditionally released”. Israel’s counter-attack has so far taken an estimated 16,000 Palestinian lives. The WHO says about 10,000 of these were women and children. Israel insists at least 5000 were Hamas militants. Guterres says this has “created appalling human suffering, physical destruction and collective trauma across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory.” “Hospitals have turned into battlegrounds”, he added. “And without shelter or the essentials to survive, I expect public order to completely break down soon”. The WHO says it cannot comply with Israel’s demands to establish the al-Mawasi safe zone “without broad agreement, and unless fundamental conditions are in place to ensure safety and other essential needs are met, and a mechanism is in place to supervise its implementation”. Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza. Dozens of Hamas terrorists have reportedly surrendered to Israeli forces in northern Gaza, with extraordinary photos showing the men stripped to their underwear.

‘Utter horror’: Troops kill Hamas commanders,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israeli-forces-battle-hamas-in-main-southern-gaza-city-as-humanitarian-situation-deteriorates/news-story/4d50773fbcb3f303a07c11fad7423e47,"Israeli forces battled Hamas militants in Gaza’s main southern city on Wednesday in some of the most intense combat of the two-month-old war sparked by the October 7 attacks. The focus of the conflict has shifted into the besieged territory’s south following fierce fighting and bombardment that reduced much of the north to rubble and forced 1.9 million people to flee. Israeli troops, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers have rolled into Khan Yunis in the south, Gaza’s second biggest city, forcing already displaced civilians to pack up and flee again, witnesses told AFP. “Our forces are now encircling the Khan Yunis area in the southern Gaza Strip,” Israel’s army chief Herzi Halevi said Tuesday. “We have secured many Hamas strongholds in the northern Gaza Strip, and now we are operating against its strongholds in the south.” The fighting was “the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation” in late October, said the army’s Southern Command chief Major General Yaron Finkelman. The streets of Khan Yunis were almost empty on Wednesday morning as residents tried to take shelter from shelling and artillery fire, said AFP journalists, while the dead and wounded continued to pour into the city’s hospitals. Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, and saw around 240 hostages taken. The latest toll from the Hamas-run government media office said 16,248 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, had been killed. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and free 138 hostages still held after scores were released during a short-lived truce. In a morning briefing the army said it had struck about 250 targets in the Gaza Strip over the past day and that troops were “continuing to locate weapons, underground shafts, explosives and additional military infrastructure”. The civilian mass casualties in Gaza have sparked global concern, heightened by dire shortages brought by an Israeli siege that has seen only limited supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines enter. Hassan Al-Qadi, a displaced Khan Yunis resident, said “the whole city is suffering from destruction and relentless shelling. “Many people arriving from northern Gaza are facing dire circumstances. Many are homeless and some are searching for their missing children.” “We are not mere numbers. We are human beings,” he said, speaking in the southern city of Rafah. The violence in Gaza “now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age”, charged aid group the Norwegian Refugee Council, which also warned of the dire public health threat of the approaching winter. Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip are living in “utter, deepening horror”, the UN human rights chief said, as he called for an urgent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. “Civilians in Gaza continue to be relentlessly bombarded by Israel and collectively punished... Palestinians in Gaza are living in utter, deepening horror,” Volker Turk told a press conference. Hamas commanders killed in airstrike Several Hamas commanders were killed in an air strike near the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, the Israeli military said early Wednesday on social media platform X. Sources in Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group, told AFP their fighters were battling Israeli troops early Wednesday in a bid to prevent them from breaking into Khan Yunis and surrounding areas. According to the Hamas-run government media office, dozens were killed and injured in heavy strikes on areas east of Khan Yunis. The Hamas-run health ministry said air strikes on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed six people and wounded 14 others. Israel had previously told civilians in the north of the densely populated Gaza Strip to seek shelter in the south of the territory, with many fleeing to Khan Yunis believing it would be safer. ‘Nowhere is safe’ As the war expands, Israel has told people to move even further south, sparking “panic, fear and anxiety”, according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. People were being pushed into an area that is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip, with roads to the south clogged, he said. International aid groups have condemned the succession of orders to flee from one area to another, saying that civilians were running out of options. “Nowhere is safe in Gaza,” said United Nations humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths. “Not hospital, not shelters, not refugee camps. No one is safe.” Following demands to create areas where civilians could shelter, Israel’s army published a map it said was intended to enable Gazans to “evacuate from specific places for their safety if required”. But the UN criticised the map, saying it was impossible to create safe zones for civilians to flee to inside Gaza. “The so-called safe zones... are not scientific, they are not rational, they are not possible, and I think the authorities are aware of this,” said James Elder, spokesman for the UN children’s agency UNICEF.

‘Nowhere is safe’ in ‘hellish’ warzone,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/nowhere-is-safe-israeli-troops-battle-hamas-militants-in-southern-gaza/news-story/1887d45a621bb5b8245670c7f684f5e9,"Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the southern Gaza Strip on Tuesday after expanding their offensive deeper into the besieged territory, with warnings that an “even more hellish scenario” was unfolding for trapped civilians. Israel had initially focused its offensive on the north of the territory, but the army is now also dropping leaflets on parts of the south, telling Palestinian civilians there to flee to other areas. Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen on Monday near the southern city of Khan Yunis, which is packed with civilians who fled their homes further north in the territory earlier in the war. The army said Monday it was taking “aggressive” action against “Hamas and other terrorist organisations” in Khan Yunis, warning that the main road in the north and east of the city “constitutes a battlefield”. Hamas claimed via Telegram its militants had targeted two personnel carriers and a tank near Khan Yunis. Rocket salvos were again fired from Gaza towards Israeli territory. As the war spreads, international aid organisations have warned that civilians in the densely populated territory are running out of places to flee to. “Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go,” said Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories. “If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond,” Hastings said in a statement. In retaliation for the worst attack in its history, Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas and secure the release of all the hostages held in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says the war has killed nearly 15,900 people in the territory, around 70 percent of them women and children. In the city of Rafah near the Egyptian border, resident Abu Jahar al-Hajj said an air strike near his home felt “like an earthquake”. “Pieces of concrete started falling on us,” he said. In Deir al-Balah further to the north, Walaa Abu Libda found shelter at a hospital, but said her four-year-old daughter remained trapped under rubble. “I don’t know if she is dead or alive,” said Libda, one of an estimated 1.8 million people displaced in Gaza -- roughly three-quarters of the population, according to UN figures. The Israeli army on Tuesday denied telling the World Health Organization to empty an aid warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours before ground operations in the area render it unusable. On Monday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X that his organisation had received a notification from the military “that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours”. Key ally the United States has cautioned Israel to do more to avert civilian casualties as operations shift to the south. Israel on Monday said it was not seeking to force Palestinian civilians to permanently leave their homes, but that it was instead seeking support from aid groups to improve infrastructure in a tiny coastal area of Gaza named Al-Mawasi. “We have asked civilians to evacuate the battlefield and we have provided a designated humanitarian zone inside the Gaza Strip,” Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said. Speaking on condition of anonymity, senior Israeli military officials admitted that around two civilians have been killed for every dead Hamas fighter in the Gaza Strip. “Hopefully it (the ratio) will be much lower” in the coming phase of the war, one of the officials added. The war has sparked fears of a wider regional conflict, with frequent exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Israel’s border with Lebanon. On Tuesday, the Israeli military said its fighter jets had struck Hezbollah positions in Lebanon in response to launches on Monday from Lebanon into Israel. The Israel-occupied West Bank has also seen a surge in violence, with more than 250 Palestinians killed there since the war began, according to Palestinian authorities. Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

‘Do not delay’ warning for Aussies in Israel,https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/anthony-albanese-confirms-19-australians-registered-in-blockaded-gaza/news-story/bbf3f0125b4ec99abf401b0d50af98e1,"Additional flights will be dispatched to ferry Australians in Israel to safety after revelations 19 Australians are stuck in Gaza amid an unfolding humanitarian crisis. Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong on Friday confirmed that additional assisted departure flights would be available for the more than 10,000 Australians in Israel who wanted to leave. At least 1600 of those people had officially registered with the Department of Foreign Affair and Trade as Senator Wong urged all those who wished to leave to “do not delay”. Two repatriation flights have already been secured with the help of Qantas to carry hundreds of Australians out of Israel to safety in London. The first repatriation flight for Australians in Israel will occur on Friday, with 200 people on-board. Senator Wong on Friday morning confirmed an additional two charter flights. Qantas has “agreed to support” Australians arriving in London on the assisted departure flights by offering a flight from London to Sydney, via Singapore, “free of charge”. “The Australian government will continue to work on options for onward travel from Dubai and to support those who cannot reach Tel Aviv,” Senator Wong and Transport Minister Catherine King said in a joint statement. The government has also urged Australians who can cross into Jordan to do so but alert DFAT beforehand Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the government was looking to help the Australians registered to be in Gaza out of the conflict zone, but the situation remained fraught. Israel declared war after Hamas – recognised by Australia as a terrorist organisation – launched a surprise operative on the weekend, murdering innocent Israelis in their homes and at music festivals, and taking about 100 people hostage. Thousands of Israeli and Palestinian civilians have been killed. The Palestinian territory has also been completely cut off after Israel announced it would not supply food, electricity, or medical supplies unless Hamas releases the hostages, with the Egyptian border shut. The United Nations has called the situation in the Gaza Strip “dire” and warned of the “devastating” impacts. Mr Albanese said DFAT was “working around the clock to ensure that Australians are kept safe” wherever they are. “There are some 19 people who’ve registered to try to leave Gaza,” Mr Albanese told 9 News. “We’re speaking with the Egyptian government as well about how we can get those people out of that area into safety as well. “This is a complex exercise, but Australia is doing what it can.” An Adelaide family who are in Gaza visiting familyhas told The Daily Telegraphhow fearful they are for their life. Senator Wong said she had not personally had any contact with the Australians in Gaza but officials had. “The situation in Gaza is extremely difficult. We are engaging with Egypt, as is the United States, about seeking to establish humanitarian corridors, but obviously the situation on the ground is extremely difficult.” He said the government was “willing to accept everyone’s offer” after Qatar Airways and partner Virgin offered assistance. Senator Wong urged any Australians who wish to leave “to not delay”. “You can register with us and we will seek to make contact with all who are registered and wish to leave aboard available flights,” she said. Jewish journalist and political activist Theodor Herzl - considered the father of the modern Zionist movement - founds the World Zionist Organisation in 1897. The aim of the organisation is to establish a national home for the Jewish people secured by public law. It comes as tensions flare back home after a pro-Palestine rally earlier this week outside the Sydney Opera House descended into anti-Semitism. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has doubled down on his calls for visa holders caught up in the event to be deported. ASIO boss Mike Burgess issued a rare public message on Thursday warning against inflaming tensions, saying “words matter”. Amid suggestions Mr Burgess made the rare intervention because of Mr Dutton’s calls for deportation, Mr Dutton said he had spoken to the ASIO boss who was “understandably concerned” about some of the scenes playing out in Australia. “If people are saying that they’re going to ‘gas the Jews’ or ‘eff the Jews’, that sort of conduct doesn’t have any place in our country,” he told Channel 9. “It’s been condemned absolutely and rightly, that does incite violence.” Mr Dutton told Sky News it was “disturbing” and “grotesque” that anyone would support the acts of a listed terrorist organisation. Mr Albanese said if Mr Dutton had “any evidence that any of these people were temporary visa holders, he should go to authorities”.

Senator Wong said Mr Burgess’ warning should come as a reminder that Australians should be “brought together, not to divide them”. “This is not a time for certain politicians to be seeking to play into the fear and division in the community. It is time for all of us to say we stand against all hatred, all prejudice,” she said. “It is a time for us to come together. We know this is distressing for the Jewish community. We know there are many in Australia who have very strong views about Palestinian aspiration and I would say to this, one of the great tragedies, apart from the horrific nature of Hamas’s activities, is they have pushed further away the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.” The budget airline has unveiled their plans to bring their fleet into the future with a number of upgrades.

Austin met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, stating that “I know ISIS very well, and it’s worse than what I’ve seen with ISIS.” “It has been a terrible week. We have seen the horrific acts of this terrorist organization. As you know, I was the one who first planned the war on ISIS. So I know ISIS very well, and it‘s worse than what I’ve seen with ISIS,” he said. Netanyahu has thanked the US for its support through the week, stating it is the responsibility of the “civilised world” to stamp out terrorist organisations. “Just as the civilized world came together to fight ISIS, the civilized world must come together to help us fight Hamas. I know you stand by us and we appreciate it very much,” he said. 9:40pm - Erin Molan clashes with pro-Palestine activist Sky News host Erin Molan had a heated argument interviewing prominent Australian writer Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah shortly after news broke of Israel’s 24-hour warning for civilians to evacuate Gaza. Molan condemned Dr Abdel-Fattah, author ofComing of Age in the War on Terror,for failing to call out Hamas and recognise it as a terrorist organisation, leading to a heated exchange over past atrocities dealt by Israel.

Dr Abdel-Fattah said she “does not see Hamas as a terrorist organisation” and repeatedly made reference to the historic “apartheid” being carried out on Palestinian civilians by the state of Israel. She claimed that the current state of affairs is the culmination of many years of oppression on the Palestinian people, insinuating media hosts are not reporting the bigger picture. “I have already said I condemn the violence that Hamas perpetrated, and it should be held to account,” she said. “I don’t see them as a terrorist organisation. What is the purpose of a terrorist label here? “Let’s talk about Israel’s terrorism on Palestinians. 9:15pm - WHO warns complete evacuation is impossible The World Health Organisation has warned it will not be possible to evacuate severely injured people being treated in hospitals, as the clock ticks down for civilians in war-torn Gaza. “There are severely ill people whose injuries mean their only chances of survival is being on life support, such as mechanical ventilators,” WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said on Friday. “So moving those people is a death sentence. Asking health workers to do so is beyond cruel.” The IDF has now publicly conceded it will be impossible to completely evacuate the city within the 24 hour timeframe, but remains adamant Hamas is ultimately responsible for civilians now caught in the crisis. Hamas has ordered Palestinians in Gaza to ignore Israel’s advice to evacuate as a ground invasion looms. 8:45pm - Protests expected across Arab world after Friday prayers Thousands of Iraqis are gathering in Baghdad in support of Palestinians in Gaza. “This rally is aimed at condemning what is happening in occupied Palestine, the bloodletting and the violation of rights,” Abu Kayan, one of the organisers, told AFP. It’s just one of several rallies planned for today across the Middle East, after senior Hamas and Hezbollah figures called for people to protest following Friday prayers. Fomer Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal yesterday urged people to “go to squares and open spaces across the Arab and Islamic world” to rally. Several such gatherings are expected in Lebanon, Tunisia and Jordan today. Security forces are also braced for unrest at al-Aqsa mosque in occupied East Jerusalem. 6:30pm - Fears grow in Gaza as deadline looms The Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City has warned Israel’s message to evacuate is simply unfeasible inside the 24 hour window provided by the IDF. Medics in Gaza are reportedly refusing to evacuate hospitals and abandon patients as the region’s strained healthcare system buckles under new casualties. “What will happen to our patients? We have wounded, we have elderly, we have children who are in hospitals,” a Red Crescent spokesperson said. “People have no place to go. That’s the point. Hearing bombardments all over the area and asking people to evacuate themselves to another area with this great destruction of the infrastructure and roads and these restrictions of movement, is just something unbelievable.” 6:20pm - Man’s final texts before family murdered by Hamas An Israeli-American family living in a kibbutz that under attack from Hamas on Saturday had texted their relatives just moments before being killed by terrorists. “They’re here. They’re burning us. We’re suffocating,” 36-year-old father Johnny Siman Tov wrote to a relative. He and his wife Tamar Kedem-Simian Tov and their three children aged between two and five, were all killed on Saturday. Johnny‘s 70-year-old mother Carol Simian Tov was also killed in the attack. 5:20pm - Eerie discovery in deserted Hamas truck The Times of Israel has revealed images of the contents of a truck used by Hamas fighters in the weekend’s attack on civilians. An abandoned white Toyota pickup truck with a Gaza license plate was found on Route 232 near western Negev. Inside the truck, reporters found a homemade bomb, a device to activate it by phone, and other equipment indicating the terrorists’ intent to hide in the area. The terrorists had backpacks with clothes, shoes, urine collection apparatus, and ammunition. Nearby, burnt cars containing charred bodies of festival-goers who were shot and burned were discovered. Further along Route 232, near the Re’im military base, signs of a firefight and the presence of terrorists were found, although their bodies had been removed. The personal effects of the terrorists were scattered along the road, including a Quran, energy drinks, and a notebook with an image of Elsa from “Frozen” on the cover. 3:40pm - Israel slams UN after evacuation notice Israel has insisted it has shown goodwill to civilians in Gaza by warning them to evacuate in the next 24 hours, as the nation’s military chief calls for war. Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan, said the IDF was trying to “minimise harm to those not involved” in its military operation against Hamas and accused the UN of failing to stand with them. “For many years, the UN has turned a blind eye to the arming of Hamas and its use of the civilian population and civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip as a hiding place for its weapons and murder,” Erdan said. “Now, instead of standing by Israel, whose citizens were slaughtered by Hamas terrorists... it preaches to Israel. It is better for the UN to focus now on returning the hostages, condemning Hamas, and supporting Israel’s right to defend itself.” 3:20pm - ‘Now is the time for war’: Deadline looms for Gaza Israel’s military chief has declared “now is the time for war” as the IDF amasses tanks near the Gaza Strip ahead of a planned ground invasion. The United Nations said it had been advised by the Israeli military that some 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza should relocate to the region’s south within the next 24 hours. “The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. “The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.” The military has had “all restraints” removed in its mission to destroy the Palestinian militant Hamas group that rules Gaza. Israel has continued to rain airstrikes down on Gaza following the weekend Hamas offensive, which is now the deadliest by Palestinian militants in its history. 2:50pm - IDF rescues ‘around 250’ hostages from Hamas militants Gripping new footage released by the IDF has shown the moment troops successfully stormed a military post taken by Hamas. The Flotilla 13 elite unit was deployed to the area surrounding the Gaza security fence in a joint effort to regain control of the Sufa military post on October 7th. The mission saw “around 250” hostages freed, according to officials. “60 plus Hamas terrorists were neutralised and 26 were apprehended—including Muhammad Abu A’ ali the Deputy Commander of the Hamas southern Naval Division,” the IDF said. 1:40pm - Horrors of situation in Gaza revealed by doctors Hospitals in Gaza are at breaking point, multiple reporters from inside the city have said, with patients ‘on the streets’ and no beds left. “It is not possible, under any circumstances, to continue this work,” said Mohammad Abu Selim, Shifa Hospital’s general director told the Associated Press. “The patients are now on the streets. The wounded are on the streets. We cannot find a bed for them.” Doctors are even having to accept that anyone in a critical condition is unlikely to survive, with resources stretched and ambulances unable to travel throughtout the bombed region. Israeli bombing has also hit the Shati refugee camp, just north of Gaza City, with entire families including infant children wiped out. 12:30pm- Israel dropping nearly as many bombs on Gaza in less than a week than the US did in Afghanistan in a year Roughly 6,000 bombs have been dropped on the Gaza Strip by the Israeli military since Saturday, which is more than the US used in Afghanistan in a whole year. The bombing campaign has killed 1,500 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian health authorities. It is understood a third of them are children. ‘Israel is dropping in less than a week what the US was dropping in Afghanistan in a year, in a much smaller, much more densely populated area, where mistakes are going to be magnified,’ Marc Garlasco, a military adviser and a former UN war crimes investigator in Libya, told the Washington Post. During the most intensive part of the war in Afghanistan, the US dropped 7,423 bombs, with 7,600 being used during the entire war in Libya. When the US was attacking Islamic State militant in Iraq and Syria, between 2,000 and 5,000 munitions were used in a month. 12pm - Israeli death toll climbs to 1,300 The number of Israelis killed in the Hamas-Israel war now stands at 1,300 - including 222 soldiers, Reuters is reporting, with the majority killed on Saturday. It’s the highest number Israel has seen since the 1973 war, which it fought after a surprise attack from Egypt and Syria. Meanwhile, Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza has destoyed 752 buildings, including 2,835 housing units, according to the UN, with nearly 1,800 now completely uninhabitable. Nearly half a million people have been displaced by the bombing campaign in Gaza. “Heavy Israeli bombardments, from the air, sea and land, have continued almost uninterrupted,” UN huminatarian agency OCHA said. “Multiple residential buildings in densely populated areas have been targeted and destroyed during the past 24 hours.” 10am — IDF demolishes pizzeria that mocked hostage The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has demolished a pizzeria in the West Bank town of Huwara after it posted an ad online mocking an elderly Israeli woman who was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists. Outraged settlers began gathering around the shop calling for it to be demolished after the ad spread online,The Times of Israelreports. The IDF arrived at the scene and a decision was made to shut down the pizzeria. Footage online showed an IDF bulldozer demolishing the front of the shop. A military order was signed directing the pizzeria be closed for five months due to its incitement and support for terror activities, according to local media. The owner of the pizzeria was also detained. The pizzeria has since posted an apology on its Facebook page claiming someone else posted the ad without its knowledge. “We are against harming men and women and just want to earn a living with dignity and live in peace with everyone,” it said. “We are very sorry to the members of our family and others who were hurt.” 9.45am — ‘The horror’: Israeli collecting corpses near Gaza Yossi Landau has spent decades collecting corpses in Israel, but he almost reached breaking point recovering the remains of people killed by Gaza militants in the country’s deadliest assault. Mr Landau woke to the sounds of sirens on Saturday, a moment he had become “used to” as Israelis took shelter from incoming rocket fire. He has 33 years of experience volunteering for Zaka, an organisation which recovers the bodies of people who suffered unnatural deaths. But as gunfights raged between Palestinian militants and Israeli forces, Mr Landau said he witnessed violence he had never seen before. “A piece of road that should’ve taken 15 minutes, it took us 11 hours because we went and picked up everyone, put them in a bag,” said the 55-year-old. After already loading dozens of corpses onto refrigerated trucks, Mr Landau and fellow volunteers reached Be’eri, a kibbutz of around 1200 residents five kilometres from Gaza. “I felt that I’m falling apart, not only me, my whole crew,” he recalled, after entering the first home and finding a dead woman. “Her stomach was ripped open, a baby was there, still connected with the cord, and stabbed.” The Zaka volunteer said he saw multiple civilians, including around 20 children, who had their hands tied behind their backs before being shot and torched. “We saw some victims positioned that they were sexually abused,” he added. More than 100 people were killed in the kibbutz, while around 270 were left dead at the nearby Supernova music festival. — AFP 9.15am — Parents mark Noa Argamani’s birthday The parents of kidnapped Noa Argamani have shared a message on her 26th birthday. Ms Argamani was attending the Supernova music festival when Hamas terrorists attacked and is among the up to 150 hostages being held by the group somewhere in Gaza. Harrowing footage on social media showed her beingtaken awayon the back of a motorcycle as she screamed, “don’t kill me”, while her boyfriend Avi Natan was held by militants with his hands behind his back. Later footage appeared to show her drinking water from a bottle in Gaza. Her condition and location are still unknown. “This beautiful woman is named Noa,” apost sharedby Israel’s official X account reads. “She was taken hostage by Hamas during a music festival. Today is her 26th birthday. Her parents ask that we all wish her a happy birthday with the hope that maybe somehow these messages will reach her. Please share. #HappyBirthdayNoa” 8.50am — Hollywood condemns ‘evil’ of Hamas Hundreds of Hollywood celebrities signed an open letter on Thursday condemning the “barbaric acts” of Hamas fighters who murdered and abducted Israeli civilians in a shocking weekend assault. Wonder Womanactress Gal Gadot, an Israeli, was among film and TV stars on the list, which also included Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Pine, Mayim Bialik, Liev Schreiber, Michael Douglas and Jerry Seinfeld. “Hamas murdered and kidnapped innocent men, women, and children. They kidnapped and murdered infants and the elderly,” read the open letter, released by Creative Community For Peace. “This is terrorism. This is evil. There is no justification or rationalisation for Hamas’ actions. These are barbaric acts of terrorism that must be called out by everyone.” The letter, which was signed by more than 700 people from the world of entertainment, is the first large-scale reaction from the industry, but follows a plethora of social media posts from individuals. — AFP 8.20am — Women tear down posters of missing children Palestinian supporters in London have been filmed ripping down posters of Israelis being held hostage by Hamas. “This is for Palestine!” one of the women says as she tears down the posters with a companion. “It’s children, it’s innocent people,” the person filming says. “What about the children in Palestine?” the woman replies. Anothervideo showeda man and a woman tearing a poster off a light pole. When confronted by a person filming, the man said he “feels so good” about it. This is a modal window.

Although Tehran has been a long-term backer of Hamas, Iranian officials have been adamant that the country had no involvement in the militants’ attack against its arch enemy Israel on Saturday. Nevertheless, the United States fears the opening of a second front on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon if Hezbollah, another heavily armed Islamist group backed by Iran, were to intervene. “Officials of some countries contact us and ask about the possibility of a new front [against Israel] being opened in the region,” said Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian during a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. “We tell them that our clear answer regarding future possibilities is that everything depends on the actions of the Zionist regime in Gaza. Even now, Israel’s crimes continue and no one in the region asks us for permission to open new fronts.” — AFP 7.50am — France will ‘do everything’ for release of hostages French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday vowed that France would do everything to ensure the release of the dozens of hostages held by Palestinian militant group Hamas after its attack on Israel. “I want to say that we will do everything to ensure that these hostages, whatever their nationality, are released,” he said in an address to the nation, adding that France would work to this end both with “our partners” and the Israeli authorities. The French president said that at least 13 French citizens were confirmed to have been killed in the attack by Hamas but 17 more “children and adults” were missing and “without doubt some of them are held hostage”. “France will never abandon its children,” he said. Around 150 people are believed to be held hostage by Hamas. — AFP 7.15am — ‘Yes!’: Gut-wrenching reaction to daughter’s death A father who was separated from his eight-year-old daughter after Hamas terrorists attacked their kibbutz on Saturday has shared his heart-wrenching reaction after finally receiving confirmation she had been killed two days later. Thomas Hand, originally from Ireland, was separated from his daughter Emily, who had gone to a sleepover at a friend’s house in their kibbutz.Speakingto CNN, Mr Hand revealed his joy at finding out Emily was dead and not taken hostage — a fate “worse than death”. “They just said, we found Emily, she’s dead,” he said. “I went, ‘Yes!’ and smiled, because that is the best news of the possibilities I knew. That was the best possibility that I was hoping for. She was either dead or in Gaza. And if you know anything about what they do to people in Gaza, that is worse than death. “The way they treat you. They’d have no food, they’d have no water. She’d be in a dark room filled with Christ knows how many people, and terrified every minute, hour, day, and possible years to come. So death was a blessing, an absolute blessing.” 7am — Gazans must ‘remain on their land’: Egypt’s Sisi Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Thursday that Gazans must “stay steadfast and remain on their land”, amid calls for Cairo to allow safe passage for civilians stuck in Gaza. The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is the only passage in and out of the coastal enclave not controlled by Israel. Egypt is committed to ensuring the delivery “of aid, both medical and humanitarian at this difficult time”, Mr Sisi said, affirming Cairo’s “firm position” of ensuring Palestinians’ “legitimate rights”. But he stressed, in a speech at a military ceremony, that Gazans must “stay steadfast and remain on their land”. Egypt, historically a key intermediary between Hamas and Israel, has called for donors to send humanitarian aid bound for Gaza to El Arish airport but has pushed against calls to allow fleeing Palestinians into its land. In recent days, state-linked media has quoted high-level security sources warning against a mass exodus of Palestinians, who were being “forced to choose between death under Israeli bombing or displacement from their land”. Egypt has pushed for a diplomatic solution and called for restraint from both sides, while Mr Sisi has asserted his country’s national security was his “primary responsibility”. On Thursday, he said that Egypt was already hosting “nine million guests, as I call them, from many countries who came to Egypt for security and safety”. But the case of Gazans “is different”, he said, because their displacement would mean “the elimination of the [Palestinian] cause”. Egypt was the first Arab state to normalise relations with Israel in 1979, after a six-year war that ended in 1973 with Egypt regaining the Sinai Peninsula from Israeli control. — AFP 6.40am — ‘Beyond anything we can comprehend’ Visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has expressed his horror after being shown distressing photos of babies killed by Hamas. Mr Blinken described to reporters what he saw in the photographs shown to him by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “A baby — an infant — riddled with bullets,” he said. “Soldiers beheaded, young people burnt alive in their cars. For any human being to see this, it’s really beyond almost anything that we can comprehend and digest. “Images are worth a thousand words. These images, maybe worth a million. The world is seeing new evidence of depravity and the inhumanity of Hamas — depravity and inhumanity directed at babies, at small children, at young adults, at elderly people, at people with disabilities. “At a basic human level, how anyone cannot be revolted and cannot reject what they’ve seen — and what the world has seen — is beyond me.” US President Joe Biden too hadexpressed outrageover the images coming out of Israel. “I’ve been doing this for a long time,” Mr Biden said at the White House late on Wednesday. “I never really thought that I would see — have confirmed — pictures of terrorists beheading babies.” A White House spokesperson later clarified that US officials had not confirmed such reports independently. The President had based his comments on the claims from Mr Netanyahu’s spokesman, the spokesperson said. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Washington takes “very, very seriously the need to be as factual and certainly truthful as we can possibly be”. Without confirming the authenticity of the images, he said “it’s obvious what Hamas has proven willing to do to innocent Israeli citizens”. “We all need to be prepared for the fact that there’s going to be additional gruesome images coming out … this is not over,” Mr Kirby said. Earlier on Thursday, Hamas rejected claims its fighters had killed infants during the cross-border attack it launched on Saturday. “The world will discover the fake and false Israeli narrative, which disseminates misinformation about alleged atrocities committed by the Palestinian resistance,” Hamas political bureau member Ezzat al-Rishaq said in a statement issued in English. “Such allegations have never been proven; no evidence has been submitted to support such false claims.” — AFP 6am — Most horrific act of Israel war confirmed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shared distressing photos of babies killed during the slaughter by Hamas terrorists — including a pair completely charred after seemingly being burned while in an embrace. “Here are some of the photos Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken,” his office said alongside the distressing images. The gruesome photos showed tiny, mangled bodies and a blurred-out infant in a bloody onesie. News.com.au has seen the images that are too graphic to publish. “Warning: These are horrifying photos of babies murdered and burned by the Hamas monsters,” the leader’s office tweeted. “Hamas is inhuman,” it said. “Hamas is ISIS.” The disturbing photos came just one day after Mr Netanyahu tweeted out a picture of a child’s bloody bed. Hamas terrorists slaughtered at least 40 babies and young children — decapitating some of them — at a kibbutz near the Gaza border, Israeli military officials confirmed. “It’s so macabre that no one wanted to reveal it until they had 100 per cent confirmation,” French journalist Margot Haddat wrote in a translated tweet. “It is a horror, a massacre. For those asking for the source. They are multiple: Israeli army, internal intelligence service and atrocious images which reached me and which I was able to crosscheck,” she said. “But the best source remains this: courageous journalists from the foreign press who were able to see / agreed to see with their own eyes the bodies in Kfar Aza.” Other photos from the scene showed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers searching through ransacked homes in Kfar Aza, with bloodstains and bullet holes visible on walls and floors. In one image a rescuer can be seen breaking down in tears standing in the kitchen of a home as he’s comforted by a fellow soldier. — NY Post 5.40am — US tells Israel: ‘Always by your side’ Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed unwavering US support for Israel in its war on Hamas during a visit Thursday but said the Palestinians also have “legitimate aspirations” not represented by the Islamists. Hamas gunmen killed 1200 people in Israel and took about 150 hostages in their surprise onslaught launched from Gaza on Saturday. “You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself,” Mr Blinken said at a joint press conference in Tel Aviv with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “But as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side.” Israeli fighter jets and drones flew above Gaza in the relentless bombardment that has levelled entire blocks and destroyed thousands of buildings, while Hamas had now fired more than 5000 rockets at Israel from Gaza, the army said. — AFP Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

Around 70 Hamas terrorists are believed to have carried out the atrocities at Kfar Aza with guns, grenades and knives, i24 News said. Some reportedly carried ISIS flags with themon their rampage. “It’s not a war,” Gen. Itai Veruv, head of the IDF’s Depth Command, told reporters. “It’s not a battlefield. You see the babies, the mothers, the fathers in their bedrooms, in their protection rooms, and how the terrorists kill them. It’s not a war. … It’s a massacre. “They killed babies in front of their parents, and then killed the parents. They killed parents, and we found babies between the dogs and the family killed before him. They cut heads of the people. “It is something that I never saw in my life,” the military leader said. “It’s something that we used to imagine from our grandfathers, grandmothers in the pogrom in Europe and other places. It’s not something that happens in new history.” The US has agreed to firmly stand beside the Jewish nation as it fights back against the terrorists. “The message that I bring to Israel is this: You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself, but as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to,” Blinken said at a news conference Thursday. “We will always be there by your side.” This article originally appeared on theNew York Postand has been reproduced here with permission Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

ABC journo erupts over beheaded baby claims,https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/abc-journalist-tom-joyner-explodes-over-beheaded-baby-claim/news-story/4188fe15e46fe798274d3aa981cd63cf,"An ABC journalist is under fire for describing stories of Hamas beheading babies as “bulls**t”. Tom Joyner, the ABC’s Middle Eastern correspondent, made the comments on a Whatsapp group exchange with hundreds of international journalist and broadcasters sharing information about the recent Hamas attack on Israel. According toThe Australian, Joyner wrote: “The story about the babies is bulls**t”. One group member responded by writing “Care to retract this now?”. Joyner apologised for the wording but insisted “we still have not seen clear evidence”. “Why hasn’t there been anything unequivocal from the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) or from Netanyahu,” he wrote. A journalist then replied “The PMO (Prime Minister’s Office) confirmed it, there are numerous eyewitness testimonies from the field and (US President Joe) Biden just confirmed seeing evidence to support it. What more would you like? “Do you need to be taken to a morgue and open body bags yourself? Shame on you.” Another journalist echoed those sentiments writing: “There have been multiple people here, myself included, saying they have spoken to eyewitnesses about decapitations.” Israeli military officials on Fridayclaimed Hamas terroristsslaughtered at least 40 babies and young children – decapitating some of them in an assault on the Kfar Aza kibbutz. Tal Heinrich, spokesman for the Israel leader Benjamin Netanyahu, said “toddlers, babies heads were cut off”. Journalist Nicole Zedek from i24 in one live broadcast, which has since been viewed millions of times on X, noted: “Talking to some of the soldiers here, they say what they witnessed as they’ve been walking through these communities is bodies of babies with their heads cut off and families gunned down in their beds.” Joyner is not the first ABC reporter to come under fire over the conflict. ABC political reporter Nour Haydar’s social media use has also raised eyebrows. Haydar has shared numerous tweets supporting pro-Palestinian protesters in Sydney. The protest on Monday night started peacefully before protesters stormed the Sydney Opera House forecourt whilechanting anti-Semitic phrasesincluding “gas the Jews” and “f**k the Jews”. “How is it possible that Palestinians in Australia are being policed for their language, protests, grief, called animals, accused of supporting terrorism, framed as instigators, and an Australian Jewish organisation openly calls for genocide,” was one of the tweets she reposted. 2GB presenter Ray Hadley pounced on the reporter. “I don’t know whether that’s covered by the ABC policy on social media, but she’s reposted quite a number so we need to check with the boss of the ABC to see whether the postings by Nour Haydar, even though they were not her own words, whether they’re in contravention of the ABC and their policy on social media postings,” he told his listeners.

Dan Mor, an Israeli-Australian actor said his 40-year-old sister-in-law, Moran Yanai, attended the Supernova music festival which was stormed by gunman in the country’s south on Saturday. The jewellery designer had been invited to set up a retail stand at the festival, where at least 260 bodies have since been recovered. Speaking to9News, Mr Mor, who appeared inUnderbelly: The Golden Milesaid Ms Yanai called her father about 7am, telling him “they were being shot at”. “Then I think at 8.30am she spoke to her mum, saying that they’re hiding, they’re being shot at,” he told the outlet. “Then we lost contact.” Desperate for information, he said the family reached out to authorities and combed through social media for any answers pointing to the whereabouts of Ms Yanai, who he described as a “peace-seeking loving artist”. They eventually came across distressing footage posted by an anonymous TikTok account, showing Ms Yanai begging for her life while Hamas militants shout in the background. In a post on Instagram, the actor said his family have been “shattered and broken since we saw the video where Moran is trembling with fear”. He added his sister-in-law was originally excited about selling jewellery at the festival on Saturday. “She was so thrilled about it! And looked forward to selling the jewelry [sic] she designed and made by hand. Excitement turned into a journey of agony when Hamas took over the event, an unfortunate end we all know.” As the conflict continues, Mr Mor, said told9Newshe still has faith his sister-in-law, a dual citizen, will be returned safe, and is calling on world leaders for help. “Please help us, we are in pain, a pain that is unbearable especially alone,” he wrote on Instagram. “Help us share and call for international community intervention.

‘Hell on Earth’: Inside Israel massacre,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hell-on-earth-inside-israel-house-of-horrors-where-hamas-killed-100-locals/news-story/126e58ddf5a1671ff3618262cca330f4,"Warning: Graphic content New images have shown a glimpse of the horrors faced by Israelis living in a kibbutz near the Gaza border, where more than 100 people were killed in an attack by Hamas militants. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) allowed reporters, including a Fox News crew, to visit Be’eri, a community located five kilometres from the Gaza border. On Saturday, the community of 1,200 was overrun by Hamas terrorists who attacked with grenades, guns, and knives. The immediate retaliation from Israel has sent a shiver across the globe as analysts fear thousands more will die in the resulting war. IDF soldiers immediately engaged in an eight-hour battle to force Hamas out of the kibbutz, going door-to-door to eliminate terrorists hiding inside Israeli homes. The kibbutz was the last settlement to be freed from Hamas intruders as the terrorists bunkered down inside the ruins. The site was not declared safe for outsiders until Tuesday after officials had removed the victims’ bodies. Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst took viewers inside one of the bloodied homes, pointing out bullet holes and blood stains on the floors. Some buildings showed signs of being hit by RPG rockets, with “beds covered in blood” found throughout the settlement. “You can see the floors are stained with blood,” Yingst said. “It was Saturday morning, around 7am, when militants stormed this village. You can see the weapons they brought with them, extra ammunition, bullet holes in the side of the house and knives on the floor. “It is completely destroyed. It looks like some of the buildings were hit with RPGs, explosives.” Yingst described the scene as “hell on earth”, declaring it was the most horrifying experience he had encountered during his reporting career. Reporters saw eight victims in body bags, some of which were local residents, and that officials were still struggling to accurately identify all the bodies. “Some may be militants. They still have to work to identify the bodies. Some are hard to identify,” Yingst said. “It is the most horrific thing I have ever seen.” The commanding officer at the scene described the horrific conditions first responders had to face upon arrival, including finding families slaughtered in their beds and bomb shelters, as well as executions with decapitations, hands tied behind backs, and shootings. Eerie signs of everyday life were left behind, with first responders finding food left on breakfast plates, family pictures and bicycles strewn across homes. Weapons used by the militants were scattered throughout the area, with their vehicles still visible nearby. “There are refrigerators like you would see anywhere in the world with pictures of little kids playing sports,” Yingst continued. “There are bicycles and still ceiling fans going inside the house and there are beds soaked with blood. The floor of that kitchen, as you saw, and there are weapons laying everywhere from those militants. You can see some of their vehicles just outside. “It is a house of horror behind me and the entire neighbourhood looks like this.” Israel has nowamassed forces, tanks and other heavy armouraround Gaza after what leader Benjamin Netanyahu called “an attack whose savagery … we have not seen since the Holocaust”. US President Joe Biden has pledged to send more munitions and military hardware to Israel, underscoring firm support for its ally in a conflict that has killed at least 22 US citizens. But Biden has also called for restraint, telling Netanyahu it was “really important that Israel, with all the anger and frustration … they operate by the rules of war”. To Israel’s enemies, Biden issued a stern warning not to get involved, saying he “made it clear to the Iranians. Be careful”. Israel appeared to be readying for a possible ground invasion of Gaza on Wednesday, but also faces the threat of a multi-front war after also coming under rocket attack from militant groups in neighbouring Lebanon and Syria. A skirmish with Hezbollah forces on the Lebanon border on Wednesday underscored the severity of the situation as the entire region braces for more chaos. On Wednesday evening, rocket sirens sounded across Israel’s north, as the army declared a suspected aerial “infiltration” from Lebanon. It later backtracked on the alert, blaming an “error”. Heavy bombardments continue to rain relentlessly on Gaza, where at least 2,540 housing units have been levelled or rendered uninhabitable, according to the Gaza Ministry of Public Works and Housing. On Thursday, the Palestinian health ministry said 1,200 people have died since Israel started airstrikes in the area. The toll on both sides now stands at almost 2,500.

Why this flag popped up on Irish mountain,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/why-a-palestinian-flag-appeared-on-a-mountain-in-northern-ireland/news-story/d6a83fca04968e910a62467f89f23378,"A day after Hamas launched its surprise assault on Israel, a giant Palestinian flag appeared on a mountain in Northern Ireland, 4000km away. The flag was erected on Black Mountain, in Belfast, by Republican activist group Gael Force Art on Sunday, after thePalestinian militant group stormed Israeli towns in an assault which has left more than 1200 Israelis deadwith more than 100 people kidnapped. Israel has retaliated by raining air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza for six days, claiming more than 1400 lives. “Gael Force Art stands in solidarity with the Palestinian people who launched their biggest operation in fifty years against the rogue state of Israel,” they wrote in a statement on Facebook, alongside a photo of the flag. “Gael Force Art calls on everyone to fly the Palestinian flag in support of the Palestinian people.” The group added “Palestinian brothers and sisters” continue to face “a murderous bombardment from the Zionist Israel state”. “The Zionist Israel State has murdered thousands of Palestinian men, women and over 3000 Palestinian children since the year 2000.” According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, about 6400 Palestinians and 300 Israelis have been killed in the ongoing conflict since 2008, not counting recent casualties. Gerry Adams, the former president of Ogra Sinn Fein, the youth wing of Irish nationalists Sinn Fein, also expressed his support, sharing a photo of the flag on social media. “The Mountain Speaks! Free Palestine,” he captioned the post on X, formerly known as Twitter. The demonstration comes as the Irish government rejected an early suggestion by the European Commission on Monday that they would suspend all financial aid to Palestine. “Our understanding is that there is no legal basis for a unilateral decision of this kind by an individual commissioner and we do not support a suspension of aid,” a spokesman for Ireland’s foreign ministry said. Spain, Portugal and Luxembourg also expressed their alarm over the move. However, hours later, the commission walked back the decision, confirming “there will be no suspension of payments”. Decades-long support for Palestine Dr Martin Kear, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Sydney, said there’s been a “long affinity” between the struggles of Palestinians, and Catholics in Northern Ireland. “There’s a lot of similarities [when it comes to] colonial domination and treatment as second class citizens,” he told news.com.au. In Northern Ireland, where Roman Catholic nationalists perceived themselves to be occupied by Britain, the Irish Republican Army fought against British rule until a peace deal was stuck in 1998. Sharing in a similar struggle, the Palestinians, believe their land in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to be occupied by Israel. “[Northern Ireland] stand in solidarity with Palestine because they know what it’s like to be under colonial subjugation,” Dr Kear explained. He said the support for Palestinian cause – which is “more rhetoric” than material – began during Northern Ireland’s three-decade conflict known as ‘The Troubles’, where 3,600 people lost their lives. During the period – spanning from the 1960s to the mid 1990s – various murals cropped up in Catholic areas of Belfast as a public sign of solidarity with Palestine. One mural painted on the corner of Falls Road by the Republican Youth Movement in 1982, showed a Palestinian Officer and a member of the IRA under the slogan: “IRA-PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) one struggle”. “Palestinians have long struggled to get their message out that they are under occupation.” said Dr Kear, “[The murals] are a visual representation of resistance and their affinity with the plight of the Palestinians.” More recently, support for Palestine was on full display when residents of Derry and the Palestinian Return Centre held a rally last year to commemorate the 46th anniversary of Land Day – when Palestinians protested Israel’s expropriation of their lands – and the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday – when British paratroopers open fired at Catholic civil right supporters. During the rally, a symbolic olive tree was planted in the infamous Free Derry corner and in the Palestinian village of Nabi Saleh to commemorate the occasion. Recent demonstrations As the conflict with Israel continues to escalate, Northern Irelanders took to the streets this week to express their support for Palestine. “The People of Derry stood at the historic Free Derry Corner and made their voices heard,” fringe Irish republican group, Lasair Dhearg, wrote on social media. The group also broadcasted the message ‘smash the Zionists!’ onto Belfast City Hall. Others have also rallied behind Palestine online, sharing photos of a 2018 demonstration when the country’s flag was displayed on Belfast’s Black Mountain alongside a sign reading ‘Free Palestine’. The sign, which included the hashtag ‘BDS’, to signify ‘boycott, divestment, sanctions’, was erected to protest Israel’s soccer match against Northern Ireland. In Ireland, some Sinn Fein politicians have also taken to social media in recent days to condemn Israel as well as Hamas. Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said on Monday that “the targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages is to be condemned outright”. “Looking at scenes at where a lot of young people were out enjoying themselves to meet with such a violent and traumatic death is just truly horrific,” she said. McDonald added “the bombardment now of Gaza is equally to be condemned”. “The truth is that for decades the Israeli state has breached international law with collective punishment, confiscation of lands, imposing an apartheid regime, denying the Palestinian people their absolute legitimate right to self-determination.” – with AFP Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

‘I refute that’: Today host’s fiery interview,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/morning-shows/i-refute-that-today-star-sarah-abos-fiery-interview-with-palestine-advocate/news-story/4f8db7f937847757a400f2100dfcbe8c,"The head of a Palestinian group in Australia has implied vision of protesters chanting “gas the Jews” outside the Opera House might not be authentic. Nasser Mashni from the Australian Palestine Advocacy Network appeared onTodayon Channel 9 this morning where has faced a grilling from the show’s co-host Sarah Abo. New South Wales Police will deploy more than a thousand officers to an unauthorised pro-Palestinian rally set to take place in Sydney this weekend. The response was sparked byugly and unruly scenes on Monday nightwhen several hundred people massed at Circular Quay. In footage of the demonstration, men in the crowd can be heardchanting“f*** the Jews” and “g** the Jews”. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button. The protest came a day after Hamas militants massacred hundreds of Israelis, most of them civilians, in co-ordinated attacks. The death toll has now surpassed 1200. Israeli’s defence force launched strikes on Gaza in response, which Palestinians say have killed more than 800 people. “I’m not condoning those images,” Mr Mashni said of the protest. “But as to the veracity of what was on those tapes, I’ve been advised by another senior journalist [that] nobody has been able to verify the veracity of that audio.” He butted heads with Abo when she suggested the “disgraceful and unacceptable” scenes in Sydney were in stark contrast to a “peaceful” protest in Melbourne. “I refute the fact the protests were different,” Mr Mashni said. “They were the same protests. The reality of people coming together to express concerns about situations is that, at times, unwanted people come along and provoke unnecessary and unwanted actions. Violence is never going to be an answer as is anti-Semitism is never the answer.” Despite questioning the authenticity of the “gas the Jews” video, he conceded such language is “absolutely unacceptable”. “Palestinians, we’re Australians, the most important thing is for us to come together. We’re all in pain. As human beings, we are sharing the pain and suffering, not only of the deaths of Israelis, we should also be feeling the pain of Palestinians. “I’ve barely slept in two days. I’ve got a friend whose grandmother has been told to leave Gaza and she said: ‘I was ethnically cleansed in 1948 as a two-year-old, I don’t want to leave Gaza, and I’d rather die here than die in diaspora.’ “The situation in Gaza is 16 years of air, sea and land blockade. This is the sixth war on 2.5 million captive people in an area of 165 square kilometres.” Mr Mashni claimed “the West” was engaged in “manufacturing consent for genocide” and raised several examples of Israeli politicians making pointed comments about Palestine this week. When Abo attempted to bring the interview’s focus back to local matters, specifically the conduct of pro-Palestine protesters in Sydney, he hit back. “It is absolutely unacceptable. That’s five times I’ve now said it. “What’s also unacceptable is the police telling Jewish Australians they can’t attend the Opera House based on some Islamophobic construct that supporters of Palestine are Muslim. Jesus, the most famous Palestinian was a Christian. “The babies getting pulled out of the rubble in Gaza today, they look like the baby Jesus. We are Australians too. Someone needs to speak up and say our humanities matter. “No-one has asked me if there are Palestinians in Gaza. There is no effort to evacuate Palestinians in Gaza. No sea port, no train station, no egress to the rest of the world. “Children in Palestine in Gaza have no hope. No education. They’ve not been to a rock concert. They don’t have educational opportunities. Our kids matter too.” Abo pressed Mr Mashni again, saying no-one would dispute “the heartache those communities are experiencing” and asked him to deliver a message to Palestinians and Israelis in Australia “about coming together and uniting”. “My statement is we’re all human beings, we have a shared humanity,” he said. “Our Foreign Minister calling for restraint is seen as a bad word. What’s wrong with our country? We need to be calling for restraint, asking for an immediate ceasefire. Apply international law. “Increasingly the world has determined Israel is an apartheid regime. We need to apply international law.” The fiery interview concluded with Abo saying: “The point about us all being humans is what we should remember.” The conduct of NSW Police has come under criticism, with the only arrest made on Monday night being of a man holding an Israeli flag at Town Hall. And it emerged police had told Jewish community representatives in Sydney to “manage the movement of those people” by staying away from the city.

Scenario would ‘guarantee all-out war’,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/fears-of-allout-war-in-middle-east-as-israel-conflict-escalates/news-story/bead820c4bb7af584192e55a31894613,"Fears of the Israel-Hamas war escalating have soared with missiles and mortars being fired from both Lebanese and Syrian territory. And it could extend across the Middle East under Iran’s new “Axis of Resistance”. The clashes alongIsrael’s northern borderare yet to approach the scale of fighting around Palestine’s Gaza Strip in the south. But it has awoken memories of a bloody battle in 2006 that killed 1100 Lebanese and 165 Israelis, and worse – whenIsraelinvaded Lebanon and laid siege to Beirut in 1982. Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters crossed the Lebanon border into Israel on Saturday to take part in the assault that caught Israel’s government and military off-guard. Since then, rocket and artillery clashes have involved the Shia Islamic extremist group Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. “With the goal of bogging down the Israelis from all sides, Hamas has called for Palestinians in the West Bank to confront Israeli soldiers deployed there directly,” international security think-tankThe Soufan Centrenotes. The West Bank comes under the umbrella of Hezbollah. Any significant Israeli military action in this occupied territory will likely trigger a response involving Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. And that would present Israel with a two-front war. “Waging major air and ground offensives in Gaza and Lebanon simultaneously would be a tough call for the Israeli government,” saysAtlantic Council analyst Nicholas Blanford. Air power alone would not be enough to hold back any assault, he explains. Israel would need to deploy a significant ground force to push Hezbollah fighters deep back into Lebanon. And that would likely trigger widespread retaliation. “A war with Hezbollah would turn regional with the Syria front opening up and the possibility of attacks from Iraq, Yemen, and even Iran,” he adds. All eyes on Hezbollah The Islamic religion is bitterly divided between Shia and Sunni dogmas. Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is considered Shia’s supreme leader. Sunni doctrine puts authority in the hands of regional Grand Imams. Hamas, the organisation behind the weekend’s surprise attack on Israel, is Sunni Islamist. Hezbollah is Shia Islamist. How willing the two factions are to join forces over Gaza is yet to be seen. But Washington is sufficiently concerned to deploy a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to the Eastern Mediterranean as an open warning for Iran and Hezbollah not to get involved. “Let me be clear, we did not move the carrier for Hamas,” states US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. “We moved the carrier to send a clear message of deterrence to other states or nonstate actors that might seek to widen this war.” The effectiveness of this deterrence is yet to be determined. “Iran’s proxies refused to flinch, with Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq and the Houthi movement in Yemen both threatening to target US interests with missiles and drones if the United States intervenes,” theSoufan Centrenotes. “The so-called “axis of resistance,” led by Iran, remains intent on setting its own red lines, which, if crossed, would trigger escalation that would almost certainly drag the entire region into conflict.” A Hezbollah spokesman this week detailed those red lines: “If Israel invades Gaza and cuts the head off Hamas or annihilates the population. If there is a new forced exodus of Palestinians from their land. And if sacred religious sites in Palestine are hit.” The spokesman added the “status quo” was about to end. “Let Israel and the United States understand that! If Israel continues its scorched-earth policy, it will accelerate the opening of a front in Lebanon.” Axis of Resistance “There has been some talk in recent months about the ‘unification of the fronts,’ meaning the closer co-ordination between anti-Israel groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), along with myriad other Iran-backed groups in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen,”notes Blanford. “Therefore, it would have been difficult for Hezbollah to simply stand back and do nothing as Israel wages its massive offensive against Hamas in Gaza.” It’s a situation echoed by fellowAtlantic Council member David Daoud. “Hamas has long ceased to be a lone militant organisation,” he writes. “Since 2018, the group has officially operated as a first among equals of the twelve-member Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian Resistance Factions. More broadly, since the 1990s, Hamas has been gradually integrated into the Iranian-led Resistance Axis, a regional network of anti-Israel political parties and militant groups.” He believes Hezbollah has used this loose framework to train and equip its “partners” in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. “Either working directly with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or separately at its behest, Hezbollah has spent considerable efforts recruiting assets inside Israel — from among Arab Israelis and Palestinians — to gather intelligence and establish sleeper cells within Israel to plan terror attacks,” Daoud adds. “Here, Hezbollah’s ties to Lebanese and Arab Israeli criminal networks have proven invaluable.” Ultimately, Hezbollah’s course will likely be directed from Iran. It is, after all, the main Shia force operating in the Middle East. “It is unlikely that Tehran will want to waste Hezbollah in a futile full-scale war with Israel for the sake of supporting Hamas,” says Blanford. “The risk lies in Hezbollah possibly feeling compelled to raise its operational tempo closer to the threshold point as the war in Gaza intensifies and the destruction and loss of life mounts.” What lies ahead? Lebanon’s interim Prime Minister Najib Mikati says his priority is maintaining stability. But his government and the nation’s institutions have all but collapsed under economic pressures, corruption and infighting. “Given the weakness of the Lebanese government in the face of the powerful Hezbollah, there is little the state can do to maintain stability in the south,” says Blanford. But the Atlantic Council analyst says Hezbollah would “face a mauling” if Israel were to move against it in force. “Lebanon would be plunged into even further misery, and there would likely be a strong cross-sectarian backlash against Hezbollah, including from its Shia constituency,” he adds. Instead, the Iranian proxy will likely increase pressure on Israel along the Blue Line – a UN -defined boundary between Israel and Lebanon – without engaging in total war. This includes maintaining the “status quo” of sporadic rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli settlements in occupied territory. “The likeliest scenario is that Hezbollah will continue to allow Palestinian militants to engage in limited harassment against Israel from Lebanon,” adds Daoud, “thus contributing to Gaza-based militant war efforts by keeping the IDF partially focused on the northern border but without sparking a major conflagration.” The risks of war, however, remain high: “If Hezbollah were to overshoot, it could trigger an unintended escalatory cycle,” says Blanford. But the “overshoot” concept also applies to Israel. Especially if it were to target Hezbollah’s 150,000-strong arsenal of rockets and missiles. Blanford warns this would likely present Hezbollah with a “use them or lose them” scenario – triggering a mass missile attack against targets across Israel. “Such a move would guarantee all-out war,” he concludes. Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

The White House later clarified that neither the President nor US officials had seen pictures or independently confirmed the alleged atrocities, and that Mr Biden had based his comments on statements by the spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and media reports from Israel. On Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu’s spokesman, Tal Heinrich,told CNNthat babies and toddlers were found with their “heads decapitated” in Kfar Aza, a small community near the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.

Those comments came after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the broadcaster that Hamas militants carried out a “massacre” in which women, children, toddlers and elderly people were “brutally butchered in an ISIS way of action”. Hamas on Wednesday denied “false” media reports about attacking children. “The Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas has strongly dismissed the false claims promoted by some Western media outlets, such as Palestinian freedom fighters killing children and targeting civilians,” the group said on its Telegram channel. The sickening reports first emerged on Tuesday that up to 40 babies were butchered, some with their heads cut off, in Kfar Aza. But the horrifying claims drew scepticism, with some media outlets saying they were unable to independently verify the reports and conflicting statements from Israeli authorities causing confusion. Nicole Zedek, a journalist with Israel’s i24 News, was the original source of the claim. “I’ve been talking to some of the soldiers, and they say what they’ve witnessed as they’ve been walking through these houses, these communities — babies, their heads cut off. That is what they said,” she said on Tuesday. “Families gunned down in their beds. You can see some of these soldiers now, comforting each other, many of them reserves, many of whom left their own families behind, not knowing the sheer horror they were going to come to. They say they’ve never experienced anything like this, this is not something anyone ever could have imagined. About 40 babies at least were taken out on gurneys. They are going house to house still taking out dead bodies.” Fox News war correspondent Trey Yingst wrote on X, “Imagine the worst things possible that can be done to humans. Hamas did all of that and more to Israeli civilians. Babies beheaded. People burned alive in their homes. Women raped and dragged through the streets. Don’t look away.” But IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said earlier he was unable to confirm the “sickening” reports of beheadings. “I have heard the reports. I have been chilled by the reports,” he told Sky News Australia. “At this stage I cannot confirm it. Sadly, I don’t think it would be beneath them to do even such monstrosity, but at this stage I cannot confirm it. The pictures are sickening. I mean I’ve been around military business for many years and I’ve seen my share of things that I would rather not have seen. It’s become like something from ... beyond our ability to comprehend.” Samuel Forey, a French journalist who visited Kfer Aza, also said he had not been able to personally verify the beheading of babies. “I checked with two emergency services (wishing to remain anonymous, as the subject is sensitive), who collected a number of corpses. Both claim that they have not witnessed such abuses — without saying that it did not exist,” Forey wrote on X. A spokesperson forthe IDFseparately toldThe Intercepton Wednesday that “we cannot confirm it officially, but you can assume it happened and believe the report”. Meanwhile, Yossi Landau, an official with Israel’s volunteer civilian emergency response organisation Zaka,told CBS Newshe personally saw the bodies of children and babies who were beheaded. “I saw a lot more that cannot be described for now, because it’s very hard to describe,” he said. Zedek said in a radio interview on Wednesday she was appalled by initial public scepticism. “I mean, babies’ heads cut off,” she said. “That’s what they encountered when they came there. So as horrible as it is and I wish that I it wasn’t true.” A revolting image circulated online by the IDF on Wednesday depicted an Israeli child’s bloodstained mattress with a streak of blood spatter on the wall and a gush of red coating the footboard. Mr Biden said he wouldn’t take any questions from reporters at the White House event — but pre-emptively answered one he said that he expected to be shouted about his efforts to bring home the unknown number of US captives taken to Gaza. “If I told you, I wouldn’t be able to get them home,” Mr Biden said. “Folks, there’s a lot we’re doing … I haven’t given up hope of bringing these folks home.” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said at the regular White House briefing on Wednesday that the number of Americans who “we believe is held hostage is very small — is very small, like less than a handful … but that could change over time”. Mr Biden has ducked press questions in other venues since Hamas’ stunning attack on Israel. He is facing mounting bipartisan calls from Congress to reverse his decision to authorise the release of $US6 billion to Iran, which reportedly helped plot the attack. — withNY Post Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

Flag man banned from ritzy suburbs,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/crime/man-to-face-court-after-alleged-antisemitic-act-in-sydneys-east/news-story/53180ebc14ee4a46c7b6932fc50c047f,"A man has been banned from entering a slew of Sydney’s eastern suburbs while he remains on bail after being charged over an alleged anti-Semitic incident in which he appeared to threaten to kill four teenagers. It has been alleged that Abdullah Al-Taay verbally threatened four teenagers on Bellevue Rd in Bellevue Hill at 6.30pm on Monday after they had tried to display an Israeli flag on their car. A video of the incident emerged online, appearing to show Mr Al-Taay telling the group to “put that thing back” before allegedly threatening them. “I swear if I f***ing see youse with that flag I’ll f***ing kill youse all,” he allegedly says in the video. “I’m telling youse right now – all of youse,” he added before retreating from the car. Police have upgraded the charges against him to four counts stalk/intimidate intending to cause fear or physical harm, “one for each of the (alleged) victims”, according to Detective Superintendent Jodie Radmore. Ms Radmore said the group of teenagers were fixing the Israeli flag to their car before heading to a vigil to commemorate the lives lost in Hamas’ attack on Israel on Saturday. “The young people were going about their business … when the driver of the vehicle stopped and started to threaten them,” she said. She said the arrest was a show of NSW Police’s commitment to stopping threats of violence. “The arrest of the male yesterday shows that we will continue to chase down the offenders who commit these unnecessary threats and violence towards people that just wasn’t warranted,” she said. Mr Al-Taay spent Wednesday night in custody before being granted bail in Sydney’s Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday. The police prosecution did not oppose his release on strict bail conditions. The court was told the police prosecution held concerns for the community’s safety given Mr Al-Taay had previously been convicted of assault and the alleged threats were made against young people. The court was told that police had asked that as part of his bail conditions he be banned from suburbs where Jewish people might congregate. As part of his bail conditions, he is not allowed to enter a list of suburbs unless for work purposes. That list includes Bellevue Hill, Double Bay, Woollahra, Queens Park, Bondi Beach, Bondi Junction, Tamarama, Dover Heights, Rose Bay, Vaucluse, Watsons Bay and Randwick. He is also banned from attending any protest or rally and must abide by an 8pm to 6am curfew. He will return to court on October 27, when he must enter a plea. Ms Radmore said police did not believe there was a high chance of physical violence in Sydney as a result of tensions over the Israel-Palestine conflict, even with protest events to go ahead this weekend. “I‘ve spoken every day since Saturday with key community members about how their communities are feeling and, currently, we have been able to assess the information they’ve provided and we haven’t seen anything more than what we’ve been talking about today,” she said.NSW Police Minister Yasmin Catley has commended the “quick work” of police over the alleged incident, saying that there is “no place for any kind of hate in our society”. “The Sydney Jewish community should never feel unsafe in their own city.Everyone should be able to conduct their business without fear,” she said.“Hatred of any kind has no place in our society. We don’t see this kind of thing in Australia and we don’t want to see it now.” Mr Al-Taay was refused bail and will appear at Downing Centre Court on Thursday. Tensions are high in Australia and around the world after conflict broke out in Israel on Saturday when militant group Hamas fired more than 3500 rockets in a surprise attack. Armed militants also stormed Jewish communities, killing and capturing civilians as hostages. Israel has responded with force in the escalating conflict with Hamas, firing thousands of rockets into Gaza in a “complete siege” of the region, flattening dozens of buildings. On Monday night, a small group at a pro-Palestinian rally at the Sydney Opera House reportedly chanted “f**k the Jews” and “gas the Jews”, a reference to the Nazi Holocaust that slaughtered more than six million Jews in Europe in the 1940s. NSW Premier Chris Minns condemned the scenes at the Opera House as “abhorrent”. “To have some people celebrate atrocious indiscriminate killing and kidnapping in Israel is appalling,” he said. “This is the opposite of the dynamic multicultural community we want in NSW and Australia.” The group behind the protest has condemned the actions of a “tiny fringe” of 20 “vile anti-Semitic attendees” who were not connected to the rally. “From our observations this occurred for less than one minute and was not an ongoing chant. They were quickly condemned for their chants and asked to leave,” Palestine Action Group Sydney wrote on social media. “Longstanding Palestinian organisers and activists, Palestinian, Arab and Muslim elders attending the protest were disgusted and deplored by the action.” “This is not what our movement stands for.” Police have charged a fifth man over the alleged machete attack outside a popular Sydney nightclub. The eye-watering cost of Hillsong founder Brian Houston’s legal bill has been revealed after he was acquitted of concealing his father’s sexual abuse of a young boy.

Insane way mum fought Hamas for 12 hours,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/mum-fends-off-hamas-terrorists-with-dyson-vacuum-cleaner/news-story/ed51e38eeb1232fdcb87349a406f97ad,"An Israeli woman and her daughter survived a 12 hour onslaught from Hamas militants by barricading themselves into a safe room using an unusual household appliance - a Dyson vacuum cleaner. Irit Lahav toldCNNthat she thought it was a “regular bombing” when she heard the blasts on Saturday, so she and her daughter took refuge in a safe room. As the noise intensified, they realised it was an armed assault in their own building. All Israeli buildings built after 1993 are required to have safe rooms to withstand rocket attacks - but they do not prevent armed attacks as they generally don’t have locks. During the “endless, endless, endless shooting and grenades” she reached out to family and friends asking how to secure the door. Eventually her brother sent her a picture of how he had locked his own door “with two broomsticks”. “I thought, ‘I don’t have any brooms. How would I do that?’ But then I remembered I had a rolling stick and I took that and then I took my Dyson vacuum,” Lahav said. ‘Endless nightmare’ As she was barricading the door Lahav said she felt “fear, fear, fear, fear” and could hear men’s voices screaming. “There was nothing we could do except we were hugging, my daughter and I, under the table, hiding in the dark,” she said. “We started saying to each other, ‘I love you’. “My daughter says, ‘Mom, I love you, I really appreciate everything you did for me.’ “And I told her how much I love her. . “And I was sure that whatever I did, the vacuum cleaner and the rolling stick wouldn’t hold, but it did.” After around ten minutes of shooting and trying to break in the attackers left their house, only to return two more times. “It was so scary,” she said. “Then the third time again they came. it was like an endless nightmare.” She estimated that 30 per cent of residents living in her community died or were kidnapped during the deadly attacks. The violence between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamascontinues to escalate, with the Gaza Strip’s two million residents now almost completely without power. Hamas, which rules Gaza and is classified as a terrorist organisation by Australia and other Western nations, launched a multi-pronged surprise attack against Israel on Saturday, killing civilians and abducting others. Israel has responded by bombarding Gaza in a wave of air strikes, imposing a “complete siege” on the region. Federal agencies in the United States have warned of potential domestic terror attacks following Hamas’ assault on Israel. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued a public service announcement saying while there was no current intelligence suggesting a planned domestic attack, the potential remained a concern amid the pervasiveness of antisemitism in violent extremist groups. “Foreign terrorist organisations and their supporters remain committed to attacking the United States within and beyond our borders,” the PSA said.

‘Nightmare’: Aussie mum’s plea from Israel,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/australian-mother-in-israel-urges-government-to-help-her-family-escape/news-story/841e5dfff06c8962a6b5f6c61f9690db,"An Australian mother stuck in war-torn Israel with her family has pleaded to be flown back to Australia. Nicole Brodie, who has lived in Israel for 13 years, said she and her three children would have to make their own way home after being flown to London on a repatriated flight on Friday. She said she was struggling to confirm details of the flights, including whether she would need visas and how she would pay for papers required to enter the UK. Her nine-year-old daughter’s passport has expired and her five-year-old twins don’t hold Australian passports “There are basically no answers. We are going to London, apparently. And then I guess we’re staying there and everyone has to make their own way home. That is how it feels,” Ms Brodie told Today. “They said if you are going to go to Australia, that will be at your expense. No problem, I don't mind paying for that, but it is more expensive and to fly from London home, then from here to home, so it has given us a bit of a sense, a false sense of helping us.” An estimated 10,000 Australian residents and tourists were believed to be in Israel when Islamist militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Saturday night. At least 1200 people have died and more than 5000 have been injured since the violence began, according to the Israeli military. Qantas announced it would be offering at least two repatriation flights for Australians leaving from Israel or Tel Aviv airport after a request from the federal government. Ms Brodie said a lot of Australian citizens were choosing to stay in the country. “There are lots of Australians here. We are all family and a lot of people are staying and supporting and helping. For me, I felt the right decision was to take my kids. My husband will be here and his family is in the army,” she said. “It is traumatising and we are together as a country, a beautiful country, and we will get through it, but it is something that is just the most horrible thing. It is a nightmare beyond what anyone could ever imagine.” Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the first two free Qantas flights were planned to leave on Friday and Sunday and flagged a third emergency flight for early next week. She urged Australians wanting to leave Israel to seek further information from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website. Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said it was possible there would be a “large demand” for flights as the situation evolved. “This is going to be a continuous process of the Australian government working with people in Israel who want to leave,” Ms O’Neil told ABC on Thursday. “As I said, this is going to continue for some time. We don't know exactly what’s gonna happen in the coming weeks and months and it’s possible there will be an initial rush of people out of Israel but then later others will want to leave.” Ms O’Neil was asked if a Sydney rally planned for Sunday in support of Palestine should go ahead despite an application being rejected by NSW Police. This came after the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas sparked emotional rallies nationwide, with both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian protests and vigils planned over the coming days. “I would just say that I would ask people not to attend these rallies and just really consider how what you say and do at a time like this affects people who are really in pain and seriously hurting,” Ms O'Neil said. “This is not about politics, it's not about your views on Palestine and Israel. What has happened here is a terrorist organisation has indiscriminately attacked and killed innocent men, women and children. “There’s no ifs or buts about this. We should be able to, as one country, outwardly and clearly condemn an act of violence.” Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza. Dozens of Hamas terrorists have reportedly surrendered to Israeli forces in northern Gaza, with extraordinary photos showing the men stripped to their underwear. The Israeli strike that killed one journalist and injured six others in Lebanon merits a “war crime” investigation.","October 12, 2023 - 9:40AM"
Sobbing dad ‘relieved’ Hamas killed girl,https://www.news.com.au/world/benjamin-netanyahu-calls-hamas-worse-than-isis-sharing-horrific-photo-as-conflict-continues/news-story/2d1e46db149c1701c959a3254e3308dd,"The violence between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas continues to escalate, with the Gaza Strip’s two million residents left almost completely without power. Hamas, which rules Gaza and is classified as a terrorist organisation by Australia and other Western nations, launched a multi-pronged surprise attack against Israel on Saturday, killing civilians and abducting others. Israel has responded by bombarding Gaza in a massive wave of air strikes, and imposing a “complete siege” on the region. Gaza now faces an indefinite period without power as hospitals struggle to stay operating amid the crisis. Follow our live coverage of the conflict below. Australian family trapped in Gaza An Australian family stuck in the Gaza Strip have pleaded for help as bombs drop metres from where they are staying. The Palestinian-Australian man, his wife and their two young children aged seven and 10, had travelled to Gaza from Adelaide to visit family two weeks ago. The family have now become stuck in the blockaded territory with all borders to ­Israel and Egypt cut off. The family have since fled from the mother’s parents’ house where they stayed on Monday night. The Aussie father told TheDaily Telegraphthat the house next door to his in-laws had been hit by a bomb and was completely destroyed. “A few hours after we arrived, the neighbourhood received a warning that a soccer field would be shelled so everyone evacuated,”he said. “The IDF bombarded not just the soccer field but the building next door to my in-laws — we just survived.” The family had attempted to cross the Rafah Border Crossing into Egypt immediately after conflict broke out but were turned back. They are now staying with the father’s parents but his wife had become sick and needs medical help. A DFAT spokesman said the government was providing assistance to an Australian family in Gaza but “owing to our privacy obligations we cannot provide further comment”. Father’s grim comments after daughter killed by Hamas An Irish father has said he was relieved to hear his daughter Emily had died in the Hamas attack on an Israeli kibbutz that claimed the lives of 100 people over the weekend. In an emotional interview with CNN, Thomas Hand said he was relieved to hear his daughter had died after a gruelling two-day wait for news. He said he believed death was a better fate for his child than being taken hostage by terrorists.  “They said, ‘We found Emily. She’s dead,’ and I just went “Yes!” I went ”yes”, and I smiled, because that is the best news of the possibilities that I knew,” Mr Hand said. “She was either dead, or in Gaza. And if you know anything about what they do to people in Gaza, that is worse than death. “They’d have no food. They’d have no water. She’d be in a dark room filled with Christ knows how many people. And terrified every minute, hour, day, and possible years to come. So death was a blessing. An absolute blessing.” Gaza hospitals have ‘a few hours’ of power left The Red Cross has warned hospitals treating hundreds of injured people in Gaza will run out of fuel for their generators just a few hours. “Our understanding is that there is still fuel - but probably only for a few hours - to allow generators to work,” regional director for the Near and Middle East Fabrizio Carboni said. Israel minister poses hostage ultimatum Israel’s Energy Minister Israel Katz has threatened to cut Gaza off from essential utilities until every single hostage is released. In a social media post on Thursday, Katz said no “electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter” until the abductees are free. Israel has put a chokehold on supplies to the Gaza Strip after the Hamas attacks on Saturday, leaving citizens stranded and hospitals at the brink of collapse. “Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home. Humanitarian for humanitarian. And no one will preach us morals,” Katz said. Israel’s top military spokesperson said the army has been able to confirm the identities of 97 people currently held by Hamas. “The military is preparing for the next stage of the war,” Daniel Hagari. Humanitarian workers have warned of the “catastrophic” ramifications from cutting civilians from power as the conflict continues to injure hundreds. “This threatens to plunge the Strip into complete darkness and make it impossible to continue providing all basic life services, all of which depend on electricity, and it will not be possible to operate them partially with generators in light of the prevention of fuel supplies from Rafah Gate,” a statement issued by Gaza’s authorities on said. “This catastrophic situation creates a humanitarian crisis for all residents of the Gaza Strip.” War could cause pain at the pump The war between Israel and Hamas has sparked fears oil prices could rise dramatically again to more than $US100 a barrel. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine early last year, oil prices hit a record $US128 a barrel. The benchmark Brent crude is currently sitting at about $US88 a barrel, up 4 per cent since Hamas’ attack on Israel. “If we start seeing the United States point the finger at Iran, we could see Iran’s oil exports start falling,” Vivek Dhar, mining and energy economist from the Commonwealth Bank,told the ABC. “We could comfortably see oil prices, particularly that Brent benchmark, cross that $US100 a barrel mark.” Biden urges Israel to follow ‘rules of war’ US President Joe Biden urged Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to follow the rules of war after the Israeli Prime Minister vowed to destroy Hamas following the Palestinian militants’ brutal attack. The 80-year-old president, who has dispatched a US aircraft carrier to the region in a show of support for Israel, also warned Hamas-backer Iran to “be careful”. Mr Biden told a gathering of US Jewish community leaders at the White House that the attacks on Israel in which 1200 people were killed was the “deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust“. But as Israel responded with air strikes on Gaza which Palestinian officials say have killed more than 1000 people, Mr Biden said he had spoken earlier Wednesday to Mr Netanyahu. The US President said he had known “Bibi” Netanyahu for 40 years and they had a “very frank relationship, I know him well”. “And the one thing that I did say is that it is really important that Israel, with all the anger and frustration... that exists, is that they operate by the rules of war,” Mr Biden said. US issues terror warning Federal agencies in the United States have warned of potential domestic terror attacks following Hamas’ assault on Israel, CNN reports. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued a public service announcement saying while there was no current intelligence suggesting a planned domestic attack, the potential remained a concern amid the pervasiveness of antisemitism in violent extremist groups. “Foreign terrorist organisations and their supporters remain committed to attacking the United States within and beyond our borders,” the PSA said. “In recent years, there have been several events and incidents in the United States that were purportedly motivated, at least in part, by the conflict between Israel and Hamas. These have included the targeting of individuals, houses of worship, and institutions associated with the Jewish and Muslim faiths with acts of physical assault, vandalism, or harassment.” ‘Every Hamas member is a dead man’ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday vowed to keep fighting Hamas, saying that every member of the Palestinian militant group was “a dead man”. In his statement, Mr Netanyahu for the first time clearly expressed Israel’s intention to “destroy” Hamas following its surprise attack on Saturday. “Hamas is Daesh [Islamic State group] and we will crush them and destroy them as the world has destroyed Daesh,” he said in a brief televised statement, the first delivered jointly with his war cabinet. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant added “we will wipe Hamas off the face of the earth”. Ex-Hamas leader calls for Friday ‘jihad’ The former leader of Hamas has called on Muslims to stageglobal demonstrationsin support of Palestinians on Friday, and urged Arabs in neighbouring countries to take up arms against Israel. Khaled Meshaal, who served as chief of Hamas from 2004 to 2017, called on the Islamic world to stage the protests. “[We must] head to the squares and streets of the Arab and Islamic world on Friday,” Meshaal said in a recorded statementsent to Reuters. Meshaal is based in Qatar, where he serves as the head of the Hamas diaspora office. “To all scholars who teach jihad ... to all who teach and learn, this is a moment for the application [of jihad],” he said. Meshaal specifically called on the governments and peoples of Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan to join the fight against Israel, characterising their involvement as a duty. “Tribes of Jordan, sons of Jordan, brothers and sisters of Jordan ... this is a moment of truth and the borders are close to you, you all know your responsibility,” he said. Faces of Israeli child hostages Children as young as nine months old are thought to be amongthe hostagesbeing held by Hamas. In the wake of the terror group’s pledge to execute one hostage for every Israeli air strike that hits a Gazan home, loved ones in Israel and abroad are begging the abductors to spare the youngest lives. Hamas, meanwhile, claims to have stockpiled “dozens” of captives in “safe places and tunnels” over the border in Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeid said in a Telegram post. One desperate Israeli mother – who requested not to be identified for security reasons – says her 12- and 16-year-old sons were abducted by Hamas while on the phone with her,ABC News reported. “My youngest, who’s only 12, [was] saying to them, ‘Don’t take me, I’m too young.’ That was it. The line cut off. That was the last time I heard from them,” she said. Ariel and Kfir Bibas:A brief video making the rounds on social media shows kindergarten teacher Shiri Shiri Silberman-Bibas clutching her sons – Ariel, 3, and 9-month-old Kfir – as the family is abducted by Hamas from their kibbutz in southern Israel Saturday. Raz and Aviv Asher:Five-year-old Raz and 3-year-old Aviv Asher are believed to have been taken hostage alongside their mother, Doron Asher Katz, and their grandmother, heartbroken dad Yoni Asher toldThe New York Times. Sahar and Erez Kalderon and Noya Dan:Siblings Sahar and Erez Kalderon and their cousin Noya Dan were violently taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz Saturday alongside their father and uncle and their grandmother, older sister Gaya Kalderon said. A heartbreaking video shows Erez, 12, looking distressed while being manhandled by Hamas gunmen near a barbed wire fence. Dafna and Ella:Divorced mum of two Mayyan Zin learned her daughters – Dafna, 15, and Ella, 8 – were abducted by Hamas when a relative sent her photos on Telegram of the girls sitting on mattresses, apparently in captivity. Yahel Neri Shoham, Haveh Shoham, Noam Avigdori:Eleven members of Israeli lawyer Shaked Haran’s family – including three children between 3 and 12 years old – have been missing since Hamas stormed their home at Kibbutz Be’eri early Saturday, a close friend told theNY Post. In addition to her parents, sister, and brother-in-law, Haran’s nieces Yahel Neri Shoham, 3; Naveh Shoham, 8; and 12-year-old Noam Avigdori, are believed to have been brought into Gaza. Israel forms extraordinary unity government Israeli media reports that members of the nation’s opposition will join Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet in an emergency “unity government”, in a show of bipartisanship as the response to Hamas’s attack unfolds. ‘Worse than ISIS’: Israeli PM shares horrific image The Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has shared a photograph of what appears to be a child’s bed covered in blood, citing it as proof that Hamas is “worse than ISIS”. Mr Netanyahu did not provide any further context. Gaza’s only power station goes dark The only power plant in the Gaza Strip, which is under Israeli bombardment and siege, shut down on Wednesday after it ran out of fuel, the Palestinian enclave’s electricity authority said. “The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped functioning at 2pm (local time),” the authority’s head, Jalal Ismail, said in a statement, having earlier warned that it was running short of fuel. It means Gaza’s population of roughly two million people is now without power, with the exception of what can be provided by private generators. Gaza man loses eight family members A Gaza resident has lost eight members of his family, including his pregnant wife, as a result of Israel’s attacks on the region. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Ala al-Kafarneh is the only survivor of an Israeli air raid that killed his family, who are some of the 1050 now confirmed dead after the retaliatory attacks. “We received a message to leave Beit Hanoon town, so we went to the beach refugee camp. They threatened the building we were in, so we went to find safety,” he said. “But the building we were in was also threatened so we had to move to Sheikh Radwan town where we stayed in an apartment. Around 4am, a strike hit us. We don’t know why. We have done nothing.” Hospitals on the brink Hospitals in Gaza are becoming increasingly overwhelmed and face shortages in crucial medical supplies. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warned that without power, the situation will deteriorate rapidly for healthcare workers and patients, as Israel’s retaliation continues through Wednesday. Executive director of MSF-USA Avril Benoît said the aid agency was “seeing shortages of water, electricity, and fuel, which hospitals rely on for their generators”. “Some hospitals only have enough fuel for four days,” she said. Israel launches 250 air strikes in just one hour into ‘Nest of Terror’ Forces unleashed 250 air strikes in just one hour early on Wednesday, Fox News’ Trey Yingst reported. The IDF said the area hit is a “Nest of Terror” used by Hamas militants to launch attacks against Israel. Dozens of buildings were reduced to rubble – leaving unknown numbers of bodies beneath mounds of debris as residents scrambled to find safety. Albanese announces repatriation flights Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has told Australians in Israel they will have the option to fly home on Friday. The Federal Government is reportedly in talks with Qantas and Virgin to offer repatriation flights to Israel to help those who wish to flee the region. “Australians who want to leave Israel on our assisted departure flights must register with the Australian government’s 24-hour consular emergency centre,” he said. “We are assessing all options to get Australians home as soon as possible who wish to travel back here. “We have been working on these contingencies over recent times and will continue to do so across the range of issues as a result of the appalling and abhorrent attacks by Hamas that we saw on the weekend.” Graphic images as Israel continues extraction Israeli workers are still removing dead bodies from the city of Sderot, four days after the city was attacked by Hamas. The Israeli death toll has risen past 1,200 on Wednesday, while the Palestinian health ministry says 1,055 people have been killed over 5,100 others injured since Israel‘s retaliation. Thousands attend Sydney vigil for Israel attacks Thousands are attending a vigil organised by Sydney’s Jewish communityto commemoratethe deaths of more than a thousand Israeli civilians after the weekend’s shock attack from Palestinian militant group Hamas. Organisers said by 6pm, close to 5000 attendees had flooded Rodney Reserve in Dover Heights in Sydney’s east. Couple Danielle Chaanger and Gioel Gottlieb, both of whom are Jewish, said they had been “devastate and crushed” at the Hamas attack. “This morning I went to my doctor and my doctor’s wife sister had been shot. She barricaded herself in the house, but they kidnapped her neighbours and killed her baby,” he said. He said he was at the vigil in a show of support for Israel. “We are not here to protest. We’re here to show that we are very different. We’re here to unite ourselves because we love each other,” he said. Gaza power plant on brink of shutdown Gaza’s power plant, the only source of electricity in the embattled region, will run out of fuel within hours as Israel continues its total siege. Head of the Palestinian Energy Authority Thafer Melhem told Voice of Palestine radio that Gaza could be completely without power in just three hours. Israel has also vowed to cut off the region from food, fuel and water supplies in an effort to choke Hamas. Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general, said over a dozen healthcare workers had been killed or injured over the past two days of retaliation. “Damage to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities has undermined services to more than 400,000 people,” Mr Dujarric said via the BBC. “The Gaza Power Plant is now the only source of electricity and could run out of fuel within days.” Israel retaliates after Hezbollah attack The IDF conducted retaliatory strikes on Lebanon on Wednesday in response to missile attacks originating from Lebanese territory aimed at an Israeli military position at the border. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the missile launches, claiming they had caused “a large number of confirmed casualties”. The attack occurred near the Israeli town of Arab al-Aramshe, across from the Lebanese village of Dhayra on Wednesday. Residents of the southern Lebanese town of Rmeish reported Israeli shelling in their vicinity as Israeli artillery shells targeted the rocket launch point near Dhayra. The IDF confirmed it is carrying out the strikes and has not yet provided information on casualties. — with AFP and NY Post A young dad was walking along a beach with his  daughter when he suffered a medical episode and fell face first, suffocating to death.

Unthinkable way woman survived massacre,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/may-hayat-describes-how-she-survived-supernova-festival-in-israel/news-story/f272c6ccdef29f4895bde360ae6d4e3d,"A woman has revealed graphic details about the massacre at theSupernova festival in Israeland how she escaped the slaughter. At least 260 people were killed on Saturday when Hamas militants stormed the event during the invasion of Israel. TheTribe of Nova-organised festival, which was attended by about 3000 mostly-young people, started on Friday night and ended with Hamas terrorists shooting dead and abducting hundreds of people. May Hayat, 30, revealed her horrific ordeal including how she had to smear herself in blood and hide among dead bodies to survive after the assault began, as detailed in atranslated thread on X(formerly Twitter). In a longpost on Instagram, May wrote: “So I went to work with my girlfriend Liron at the bar in the Nova’s party, the whole night and morning we were together. “We had so much fun. There was a beautiful sunrise and we went towards our trailer to drink coffee and rest. Then the nightmare began - rockets started flying over our heads.” Music at the festival stopped and May waited for a chance to escape. She then received a phone call from a friend who informed her that people driving away from the festival were being shot by Hamas militants. “I ran to the police officers closest to me to ask them to go and reinforce the people in the vehicles, but then we realised that there’s so many terrorists in our area and they are very close to us. There was one big chaos,” she wrote. May then hid on the floor of a police station. “Some people cried, some shouted, some had anxiety attacks and some were completely silent.” She tried to comfort people who were upset while her friend Liron helped the wounded. Then the noise of gunshots grew louder. “The policemen stood in the doorway ready with their weapons and looked at each other with a frightened look and shouted to ‘storm!’,” she added. “They turned to us just before leaving the room and told us to ‘run and pray’. They came out and got shot one after the other.” The Hamas militants fired bursts of gunfire at the room, followed by deathly silence. May fled for her life. “We left the room running to the battlefield, and while I’m running I turned back and I saw Liron. She stayed there and didn’t come with us,” she said. “We tried our best and ran as fast as possible until we reached some ambulance and hid behind it. The shots came from every direction. To our right, to our left, behind and in front of us.” She managed to get into a vehicle and tried to escape but was immediately shot at. The vehicle turned around but it was soon targeted again by gunfire. The car’s wheels got stuck in sand and the party tried to escape on foot. With another person, she scrambled into a hole and waited, praying fervently. But she was discovered by eight Hamas militants. “I closed my eyes tightly because I was sure they gonna shot us but then they grabbed us and lofted us from the ground. “They took our phones and everything we had in our pockets. They announced in their walkie-talkie, ‘We have 2 more abductees’.” One of the men tried to communicate with May in Arabic but she didn’t understand what he was saying. “I didn’t shout, I didn’t went crazy, I became apathetic. He put his jacket on me while the rest of them was looking at me like I was a piece of meat because I was wearing a tank top. In one hand he holds my hand, and in the other hand he holds a missile. “We started walking and I saw that they were looking on the floor for things like cigarettes and drinks. So I helped them. I didn’t want to resist.” The other prisoner — a man — became extremely emotional and began crying and begging for his life. May tried to warn him that crying would annoy their captives. “They had knives and hammers. I realised we were in danger,” she said. May revealed that when the man continued to beg for his life, he was murdered in front of her. The terrorists then began to abuse her physically. “One of them took a board and every few seconds hit me on the head. “The other one was holding a knife and every few seconds approached me threateningly. It was important for them to humiliate me.” What happened next probably saved her life. One of Hamas militants then took her hand and took her under “his wing”. There was an attempt to take her away in a car, but it failed to start. She was warned not to try to escape: “If you try to escape I’ll kill you like I killed your friend,” one of the men said. While standing next to one of the men, she decided to make a run for it. “I didn’t know what to do and in one moment I just started running. I stole a glance back and saw that no weapon was pointed at me so I continued to run like crazy,” she said. She then hid underneath a stage platform and lay down next to three dead bodies — it was the beginning of a gruesome ordeal “I smeared myself with the blood that dripped from one of the bodies next to me and pretended to be dead for 3 hours,” she added. “Three hours that felt like an eternity. Three hours where terrorists pass by me and shoot everywhere and burn every possible piece of land, while rockets float above my head. For Three hours I lie among corpses and wonder what will happen to me.” Eventually, she heard people approach talking Hebrew and screamed “help” loudly. It was the Israel Defense Forces, who took her paramedics along with other survivors. What she saw was indescribably horrible. “In the background, the shooting continued, and in front of my eyes I saw difficult sights that I will spare you and will not describe here.” She finished with a tragic update. “But Liron, remember Liron from the beginning go the story? My girlfriend. They killed her. They killed are my hero and unfortunately no one will ever be able to bring her back.” Women arehistorically often the targets of kidnapping and sexual violencewhen conflicts break out.

Grim prospect of Israel’s next move,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/gaza-strip-residents-have-nowhere-to-go-as-israel-promises-revenge/news-story/b0ec054557058a3eeac6064d978034d4,"Israel is angry. Its pride in its military has been shattered. Itsconfidence in its intelligence agencies evaporated. Its faith in its political leaders undermined. Now, the residents of Palestine’s Gaza Strip fear this will trigger a repeat of the 1948 act that triggered decades of violence – what Palestinians call the “Nakba”. “We need to break the enemy’s bones,” Israel’sHayomnewspaper demanded at the weekend. “We need to bring it to its knees until it begs us to stop, to strike at it mercilessly and to pummel it viciously.” That echoes the sentiments echoing through Israel’s halls of power. “The price theGaza Stripwill pay will be a very heavy one,” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant proclaimed while visiting the devastated southern city of Ofakim. It was one of the main targets of the surprise weekend Hamas assault. It’s a site full of symbolism. The village – part of the UN’s Arab partition – was destroyed by Israeli forces in 1948. Its residents, along with tens of thousands from the surrounding Negev desert, were evicted and forced into refugee camps in the Gaza Strip to create a buffer zone between Israel and Egypt. Ofakim was re-established in 1955 as an outpost for immigrant Jewish settlers. It’s now a city of 34,000. And it’s one of hundreds of Israeli settlements the International Court of Justice has judged to have been illegally built on UN-partitioned Arab territory. That mass-enforced migration became known to Arabs as the “Nakba”, which means “Catastrophe”. Its consequences can still be seen in Palestinian refugee camps still scattered across the Middle East. Now, fears of a second “Nakba” are rippling worldwide. “Anything less than invasion will be a grave mistake,” former commander of Israel’s Gaza Division, Amir Avivi, declared. “We need to conquer Gaza, or at least most of it, and destroy Hamas. We cannot continue to do the things that we did before that are not working. Not doing that will be devastating for Israel’s ability to deter not only Hamas, but the whole region.” Monstrous acts “Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you,” philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche warned. The body count from the weekend’s attacks on Israeli settlers, civilians and military outposts continues to rise. More than 1200 are confirmed dead, and another 2700 wounded. The most brutal attack was carried out against the 3500Supernova music festival attendeesin the Negev desert near the Gaza-Israel border. The current death toll of 260 is expected to rise further. An unknown number have been taken as hostages, with Hamas threatening to use them as human shields against retaliatory Israeli strikes. “We have previously warned the Israeli occupation against continuing their crimes and appealed to world leaders to work on putting an end to the Israeli crimes against our Palestinian people and detainees, their holy sites and homeland and to put pressure on the Israeli occupation to abide by international law and resolutions,” a Hamas statement reads. “Neither did the Israeli occupation leaders heed our demands, nor did the world leaders act in this regard.” Israel’s embattled Prime Minister Netanyahu is not deterred. “I say to the residents of Gaza: Leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere,” he warned. “The IDF will immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas’s capabilities. We will destroy them, and we will forcefully avenge this dark day that they have forced on the State of Israel and its citizens. As Bialik wrote: ‘Revenge for the blood of a little child has yet been devised by Satan’.” Preparations for that “revenge” are well underway. But Netanyahu has not specified where he wants Gaza’s two million residents to “leave” to. Israel’s Defence Force is currently massing 300,000 troops after calling up its reservists. These are now assembling near Gaza and Lebanon. On Tuesday, Israel’s Defence Minister Gallant declared a “total siege” of Gaza. “There will be no electricity, food or fuel,” he said. “We are fighting human beasts and acting accordingly.” What does ‘permanent solution’ look like? Netanyahu has appealed to the memory of Jewish “Diaspora” – or “Exile”. It refers to the eviction of the ethno-religious group from the Holy Land by the Babylonians in 586BC. A second “Diaspora” was triggered by the occupying Roman army’s response to an uprising in 70AD. “Once, the Jewish people were stateless”, Netanyahu declared on Tuesday. “Once, the Jewish people were defenceless. No longer. “In fighting Hamas, Israel is not only fighting for its own people. It is fighting for every country that stands against barbarism.” It’s a similar argument to that being used by Hamas. “The Zionist colonial occupation occupied our Palestinian homeland and displaced our people, destroyed our towns and villages, committed hundreds of massacres against our people, killing children, women and elderly people and demolishing homes with their inhabitants inside in violation of all international norms, laws and human rights conventions,” the Hamas statement reads. But the brutality of the weekend’s attacks has reset the equation once again. “Even relatively liberal and peace-seeking Israelis are expressing a shift in perspective in the aftermath of Hamas’s latest attack,” arguesForeign Policy analyst Anchal Vohra. “Its scale and brutality have shocked Israel and united the diverse and quarrelling political landscape, with many now seeking a permanent solution to Hamas. For many, this means removing the group entirely from its sanctuary in Gaza.” Palestinians fleeing Gaza have few options. They can cross Israeli territory and go north, into Lebanon. Or they can go south, into the Sinai desert. And Egypt fears a mass of refugees flooding into its territory. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi this week ordered his troops to close the Sinai Peninsula border crossing with Gaza Strip, calling the situation “highly dangerous”. He added he would not allow Israel to resolve its problems “at the expense of others”. Second Nakba “Talk of ‘another Nakba’ is on the rise in Israel,” saysYousef Munayyer, head of the Palestine/Israel program in Washington DC. “Most of Gaza’s residents today are in the territory because of the Nakba and continue to be denied repatriation to their ancestral homes in present-day Israel and the West Bank.” Even before the war, members of Netanyahu’s ultranationalist government expressed a desire to “wipe out” Palestinian villages. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich later said his call – made as Israeli settlers stormed the Palestinian West Bank town of Huwara – was a “slip of the tongue”. But Hamas’ indiscriminate attacks are again fuelling such rhetoric. “Israeli politicians are calling to ethnically cleanse Palestinians again,” writes Munayyer. “An Israeli Knesset member who is part of Netanyahu’s Likud party tweeted this weekend: “Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of ’48.” Munayyer, however, says such a sentiment is not new. He points to a 2015Pew Research Center poll, which found nearly half of Jewish Israelis (75 per cent of Israeli citizens) wanted all Arabs expelled from Israel. Meanwhile, a long-term military occupation of Gaza seems all but inevitable. “Any ground incursion that seeks a permanent diminution of Hamas, however, requires not just going in but staying back and reoccupying the strip,” says Vohra. “Israel thus faces a dilemma. Without boots on the ground, it cannot stop Hamas, but being on the ground means not just spending vast sums of money to take responsibility for the Palestinians post-conflict but also inevitably losing a lot of lives on both sides.” ‘Mighty vengeance’ Netanyahu’s plans for ‘mighty vengeance’ are taking shape. “The enemy will pay an unprecedented price,” he declares. “All of the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn them into rubble.” Reports suggest some 600 Palestinian civilians have already been killed in retaliatory strikes. Israel claims the deaths of more than 1000 Hamas fighters. International law demands “proportionality” in response to acts of war. But proportionality is a subjective term. “The sympathy that Israel has garnered this week, despite often being seen as an aggressor in the conflict reluctant to make concessions and find peace, might soon deplete if unarmed residents of Gaza have nowhere to go and die in droves in Israeli bombings,” Vohra concludes. But civilian deaths are inevitable, arguesBrooking Institution senior fellow Benjamin Wittes. “A large number of innocent Palestinian civilians will also die — even if Israel conducts every strike in full compliance with the most rigorous understanding of the law of armed conflict,” he writes. “The nature of conflict in Gaza makes it impossible to respond to Hamas’s atrocities without inflicting substantial civilian harm. Palestinian civilians will die. And it won’t be a small number of them either.” On the edge of an abyss? Wittes says Israel now needs to make a repeat surprise attack virtually impossible. “This would be true of any Israeli government, but it’s particularly true of a government of the right and far-right who speak in the language of security,” Wittes states. “Having failed to prevent this massacre, Netanyahu cannot afford to leave Israel vulnerable. (He) has to do something big …” But, Israel has been militarily attempting to suppress various militant Arab groups since 1948. It has invaded Egypt. It has invaded Lebanon. It has laid siege to Beirut. It has occupied Gaza. It continues to seed settlements throughout the Palestinian West Bank. Few of these moves have produced lasting security results. “Israel has pursued a strategy of “mowing the lawn,” a phrase it uses to describe the periodic bombing of Palestinians in the territory to keep armed groups at bay,” saysMunayyer. “But each time Israel says it is going to degrade and destroy the capabilities of Gazan militants, fighters soon prove they have only expanded and increased their capabilities.” Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza. Dozens of Hamas terrorists have reportedly surrendered to Israeli forces in northern Gaza, with extraordinary photos showing the men stripped to their underwear. The Israeli strike that killed one journalist and injured six others in Lebanon merits a “war crime” investigation.","October 11, 2023 - 10:35PM"
Urgent move to get Aussies out of Israel,https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/closing-urgent-move-to-get-aussies-out-of-israel-via-repatriation-flights/news-story/aeca63d42c2833fa2a25613e2294fea1,"Australians stuck in Israel will be able to board repatriation flights as early as this week, amid concerns the window to exit via Tel Aviv is closing. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Wednesday that the repatriation flights run by Qantas will begin leaving Israel on Friday. “We understand that many Australians are experiencing difficulties with delays and cancellations with commercial flights,” Mr Albanese said in a press conference on Wednesday. “For Australians who do not already have plans to leave through commercial options, Australian government-assisted departure flights will depart from Friday.” Two Qantas flights from Israel to London have already been organised according to the Prime Minister, with more to come. “We have been working on these contingencies over recent times and will continue to do so across the range of issues as a result of the appalling and abhorrent attacks by Hamas that we saw on the weekend,” he said. Australians who wish to leave on assisted departure sites must register with the Australian government‘s 24-hour consular emergency service. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was directed by minister Penny Wong to commence planning for assisted-departure flights on Monday night, according to government sources. Transport Minister Catherine King spoke with the chief executives of Virgin and Qantas to ask them to work with DFAT on options for repatriation flights. Neither airline currently operates flights to Israel. More than 1,000 people are reported to have been killed in Hamas attacks, and another 900 killed in retaliatory strikes into Gaza by Israel in the days since. Mr Albanese said that the government wasn’t sure how many Australians had been impacted by the conflict. “There are so many Australians in the area, that it’s not completely clear how many are there, let alone how many are unaccounted for,” he said. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said the government was looking at “all options” to get Australians home safe. “A number of airlines, a number of international airlines, are cancelling flights. And so, if you like, the avenue of travel is closing, hasn't closed, but it is more difficult,” he told Melbourne’s 3AW. “And in that context, we absolutely understand that there will be Australians … who will want assistance and we’re actively working on all of that as we speak.” It comes as the Prime Minister is under pressure to confirm whether a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) had been convened in the wake of the conflict. Opposition leader Peter Dutton said Anthony Albanese didn't have a “coherent reason” as to why the meeting hadn’t been called, given the recent display of anti-Semitic behaviour at a pro-Palestine rally in Sydney. Mr Albanese hit back at Mr Dutton’s criticism, saying he would not talk about the NSC but that his government “has had every single one of the appropriate meetings forums, discussions, briefings”. “I‘m stunned that somehow people think that it’s an appropriate political issue to try to secure some advantage, I find Mr Dutton’s comments, I think they speak for themselves,” he said. “The way that I deal with National Security Committee and national security issues is to take them seriously...We don‘t foreshadow when NSC meets, we don’t produce the minutes of NSC. “That’s the way that national security, diplomacy and intelligence should work, not as a political game.” Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil would not say when asked by Sky News on Wednesday afternoon. “I will say that I‘ve been briefed every day by security officials, the Prime Minister’s been briefed every day by security officials, on the way that the Australian government is responding to this,” she said. “Peter Dutton would know as a former Home Affairs Minister but we are lucky to have some of the most professional security agencies in the world. “I take their advice on how to manage these issues, not the leader of the opposition.” But she did confirm the national co-ordination mechanism (NCM) had been triggered in response to the conflict. The NCM is the same Australia uses in response to a flood or a fire and brings together departments at a state and commonwealth level. It was last triggered during the high-profile Optus data breach last year. Ms O’Neil said it is the first time it had been activated during such an event. Earlier on Wednesday, the first Australian victim murdered in Hamas was confirmed to be 66-year-old Galit Carbone, who was killed outside her home in a kibbutz 5km from the Gaza Strip. The budget airline has unveiled their plans to bring their fleet into the future with a number of upgrades. Family of a man buried alive in sand on Queensland’s Bribie Island have paid tribute to the best “son, brother, boyfriend and mate” following a tragic update to his condition. The US military has grounded an entire fleet of aircraft after a deadly crash last week off Japan. It came just months after a fatal crash in Australia.","October 12, 2023 - 6:06AM"
Hamas-killing woman hailed as hero,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israeli-woman-hailed-as-a-hero-for-killing-terrorists/news-story/aebb533af17feddc4ebe761c7ba38ae5,"The Hamas was no match for an intrepid 25-year-old Israeli woman — who saved an entire kibbutz from harm by leading a group of residents to kill more than two dozen advancing terrorists, including five she slaughtered herself, theNew York Postreports. Inbar Lieberman, the security co-ordinator of Kibbutz Nir Am since December 2022, heard explosions early Saturday, when the terrorists launched their unprecedented attack on the Jewish state, according toWalla News. She realised that the sounds were different than those heard during the usual rocket attacks on the kibbutz — located near Sderot and a stone’s throw from the Gaza Strip. So Lieberman rushed to open the armoury, distributed guns to the 12-member security team and co-ordinated their decisive response amid the unfolding attack. She placed her squad of kibbutzniks in strategic positions across the settlement and set up ambushes that caught the gunmen off guard and turned the tables on them during their mission to inflict mass casualties. Lieberman killed five terrorists by herself, while the others gunned down 20 more over four hours as they turned Nir Am into an impenetrable fortress — while nearby kibbutzim suffered heavy losses, Walla News reported. Ilit Paz, cultural co-ordinator at Nir Am, told thenews outlet Israel Hayom: “It was amazing. My husband was part of the standby unit that worked to prevent more casualties. “They heard the shots and made contact on their own with other members of the standby unit and with Inbal — and they understood that they were told to be on standby. “But Inbal made a decision not to wait and be jumped operationally. In fact, the fact that they did it early prevented dozens of casualties,” she added. A social media post also lavished praise on the heroic woman, theMaariv dailyreported. “When it’s all over, this woman will receive the Israel Prize. The story of her heroism is a story that will go down in Israeli lore for generations. Inbal is the reason there is one kibbutz in the entire surrounding area that remains unharmed — Nir Am,” the post said. At least 900 people have died and 2,600 others have been injured in Israel, according to the most recent numbers.

Kidnapped schoolgirl’s chilling final words,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israeli-schoolgirls-chilling-final-words-to-her-mum-before-being-kidnapped-by-hamas/news-story/0fccda989494cb6b167fd643fc682363,"A weeping mum told last night how she listened helplessly as Hamas savages kidnapped her young daughter and elderly mother. Galit Dan, 53, was five miles away when terrified Noya, 12, whispered in her last message: “Help me”,The Sunreported. The youngster and her 80-year-old nan are believed to be held hostage in Gaza. Terrorists from Hamas also reportedly beheaded babies in a barbaric rampage through a nearby Israeli village which left 40 youngsters dead. Last night, farmer’s wife Galit told how she waved Noya off for a sleepover with the girl’s gran Carmela hours before Hamas attacked. As shootings and explosions erupted near to the Gaza border on Saturday morning, Galit fled to a fortified panic room at their home with Noya’s stepdad and her other daughter Tomal, nine. Noya and her nan did the same and they texted each other in darkness for hours, too terrified to speak. Then, heartbreakingly, Noya sobbed in a whispered last voice message: “Mummy I’m scared. There are people in the house — help me.” Nothing has been heard of her or her gran since and they are not among around 20 bodies identified in the kibbutz — or small farming community — of Nir Oz. Instead, they are feared to be with 150-plus hostages taken to Gaza bunkers, threatened with execution on video by Hamas. Galit, husband Inon Ilan and Tomal were rescued after 22 hours at their home in the settlement of Kibbutz Kissufim. Galit, evacuated to a Dead Sea resort hotel, told The Sun last night: “The pain is indescribable. “My little girl went for a sleepover with her granny and was messaging us as these animals came for them. “Our best hope now is that they have been kidnapped and will somehow survive. “I am desperate to see my beautiful daughter home and beg anyone with power to do whatever they can. “I am living every parent’s nightmare — every parent in the world will feel our pain.” Galit fought back tears as she told how Noya was a high-functioning autistic child distressed by noise. Her stepfather Inon, 55, said: “Noya is a very sweet, very funny, very clever little girl — but she is also extremely sensitive because of her autism. “It was heartbreaking hearing her last voice message begging for help when we were so powerless and surrounded by men trying to kill us. “I don’t know how she will be coping but I just hope she is still with her granny and that she is doing her best to protect her. “But Carmela is 80 years old and vulnerable herself. “What do they hope to achieve by doing this to innocent helpless people?” He told how they had fled into the panic room — built into all properties in the area — after sirens sounded early on Saturday. Inon recalled: “We heard shooting then explosions and could hear the Hamas soldiers shouting in Arabic ‘Slaughter the Jews’. “None of us spoke and we were left in total darkness when the power went off. “Then they came in the house and tried the door of our room, but couldn’t get in.” Meanwhile, another villager Shmuel Harel, 33, said Hamas gunmen shot his 90-year-old grandmother Jina Semiaitz twice in the head. He went on: “Then they went to her 71-year-old cousin, Ofer Ron, and shot him too in exactly the same way. “These are the new Nazis. “This was a Holocaust.” Columns of Israeli tanks were massing around Gaza last night as Hamas rockets continued to blast Tel Aviv. Peace activist Gershon Baskin — who helped formulate a 2011 deal with Hamas — warned: “Israel won’t negotiate this time.” This story was originally published byThe Sunand has been reproduced with permission.

Huge show of support at Jewish vigil,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/nsws-jewish-community-to-gather-for-vigil-for-israelis-killed-in-the-hamas-attacks/news-story/8485fea985afc813c032c50088d78385,"More than 9000 people have thrown their support around the Jewish community at a vigil following the weekend’s shock attack on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas. Local Dover Heights woman Cindy S, who attended the event with her daughter and cousin Danny S, said she wanted her daughter to know her local community supported her family and the Jewish community at large. “We stand by Israel. We cannot stand by and have our people murdered and treated this way. It’s barbaric,” Cindy said. “We are here in solidarity as the whole world should be doing.” Danny said the vigil was a “place of love and it makes me proud to be a Jew”. “There will be tears but there will be tears not only for sorrow, but for our proudness of who we are.” Bondi woman Galit Gershowitz, whose 20-year-old son was currently serving as a sniper in the elite combat unit within the Israeli army, said she felt a sense of community attending the vigil. “It’s showing us as a family that we’re not alone,” she said. “My son didn’t go to fight, he went to protect our country. We just want peace. She said she felt “scared and anxious” for her son’s welfare but was proud of this contribution. Couple Danielle Chaanger and Gioel Gottlieb, both of whom are Jewish, said they had been “devastate and crushed” at the Hamas attack. “This morning I went to my doctor and my doctor’s wife sister had been shot. She barricaded herself in the house, but they kidnapped her neighbours and killed her baby,” he said. He said he was at the vigil in a show of support for Israel. “We are not here to protest. We’re here to show that we are very different. We’re here to unite ourselves because we love each other,” he said. Speaking to the crowd, Executive Council of Australian Jewry’s president Jillian Segal also spoke about the barbarism of the attack. “Not since the Holocaust have so many Jewish lives been taken in a single day,” she said. “We are totally shattered as we stand together this evening, mourning for the hundreds of lives lost and praying for the safe release of the hostages.” She also thanked Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Foreign Minister Penny Wong, the Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and local federal MP Allegra Spender for their support. “We call all fair-minded people and our political representatives in demanding the safe return of the hostages,” she said. “We also demand those who burnt the Israeli flags at the Opera House... to be identified and prosecuted. “And we call for determined leadership on anti-Semitism and race hatred from all our governments.” NSW Premier Chris Minns, federal Health Minister Mark Butler, federal Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and NSW Opposition Leader Mark Speakman spoke at the vigil. Representing the Prime Minister, Health and Aged Minister Mark Butler said the government condemned the actions of Hamas “unequivocally”. “More Jews were killed on Saturday than any day of the Holocaust,” he said. “I express my sympathies to those who were affected by the deep acts of terror. “Anti-Semitism has no place in this country … just as we stand with the state is Israel, we stand with the Jewish community.” Mr Minns affirmed apologised for recent anti-Semitic incidents since the weekend. “It is with a lot of sorrow that I acknowledge some of the hatred that was seen in your own city and I am deeply sorry,” he said. “I don’t want to live in a world where that happens and I won’t live in a state where that is allowed to happen. Mr Dutton thanked the Jewish community for their “resolute behaviour,” and likened the attacks by Hamas to the 9/11 attacks and ISIS. He said Australia would join the rest of the world in sending a message to Hamas that their acts “would never be tolerated. “As Australians we value many attributes and when we look at the story of Israel, it’s a story of many trials and tribulations,” the Liberal leader said. “The terrorism we’ve seen in recent days cannot be given moral equvalience of any behaviours other than terrorist events that have taken in recent history.” Mr Albanese is in Melbourne, where he has visited a synagogue. He told the Jewish community in St Kilda it was a “time of profound sorrow” and vowed his government “will stand with Israel. We always will.” “We meet today at a time of profound sorrow, in the shadow of terrorist acts that are truly abhorrent,” he said. “We have seen unimaginable atrocities, targeting children. “The government and the people of Australia condemn this attack by Hamas. “The targeting of civilians and taking of hostages is an affront to all Australians and we condemn these horrific acts.” He also promised the government would act on anti-Semitism sentiment and actions. “I want to assure you, that kind of hateful prejudice has no place in Australia,” the Prime Minister said. “Our country is better than that – and our country is a better place because of you and your community. “My government is committed to keeping the community safe.” Earlier on Wednesday, Acting NSW Police Commissioner Dave Hudson said there would be a “heavy police presence” at the vigil to ensure the safety of participants. “I think that one could expect that the Jewish community would hold such a vigil and our sympathies go that group.” Commissioner Hudson added that extra security and police presence had been deployed to Jewish schools and synagogues, plus Jewish retirement homes and hospitals at the request of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies. The commemoration comes after protesters shouted anti-Semitic slurs and burnt the Israeli flag at the Sydney Opera House on Monday night. At the time the landmark was illuminated in the blue and white colours of Israel as a show of solidarity, however the city’s Jewish community were advised to stay away from the Opera House due to safety concerns. On Wednesday, the Premier apologised to the Jewish community for not giving them a space to grieve. “I really want to make it clear to the Jewish community that I want to apologise to them, specifically, on behalf of the government and myself as the Premier of NSW,” he said. “The intentions were to light up the Opera House as a space for the Jewish community to commemorate what happened in Israel, the number of family and friends caught up in the conflict. “We didn’t do it. I take responsibility for that. I want to ensure it won’t happen again.” Many Aussie cities are bracing for their hottest days in years, including one urban hotspot that can expect temperatures in the mid-40s.

Pornstar’s Hamas post backfires horribly,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/playboy-fires-mia-khalifa-after-porn-star-expressed-support-for-hamas/news-story/737ad4758d00ea99ae26a1aff1bb840e,"Playboy has cut ties with porn star Mia Khalifa over her “disgusting and reprehensible” support of Hamas — in which she even urged terrorists to film their atrocities. The adult magazine announced its decision to part ways with Khalifa — who joined its Centerfold platform in February 2022 — in an email to subscribers late Monday. “We are writing today to let you know of our decision to terminate Playboy’s relationship with Mia Khalifa, including deleting Mia’s Playboy channel on our creator platform,” the Playboy Team wrote. “Mia has made disgusting and reprehensible comments celebrating Hamas’ attackson Israel and the murder of innocent men, women and children,” the email continued. “At Playboy, we encourage free expression and constructive political debate, but we have a zero-tolerance policy for hate speech,” it concluded.“We expect Mia to understand her words have actions and consequences.” Users trying to access Khalifa’s page on the Centerfold platform will be confronted with a “Not Found” graphic. Canadian-based magic mushroom distributors Red Light Holland also announced they’d fired Khalifa “due to her disgusting tweets celebrating rape, kidnapping, abuse and murder by Hamas Terrorists in Israel”. “Consider yourself fired effective immediately,” the company’s CEO, Todd Shapiro, tweeted Khalifa of her “beyond disgusting” messages. Mia was quick to respond to the Tweet, writing “I just wanna make sure there’s 4k footage of my people”. The pornstar’s OnlyFans account appeared to still be active Wednesday. The adult site did not respond to a request for comment. The adult entertainer drew mass outrage after posting a series of controversial tweets praising Hamas over the weekend. “If you can look at the situation in Palestine and not be on the side of Palestinians, then you are on the wrong side of apartheid, and history will show that in Time,” Khalifa wrote on X on Saturday. In a now deleted post, Khalifa called a photo of Hamas terrorists a “Renaissance painting.” She encouraged the cowards to share shortage of their terrorism, writing: “Can someone please tell the freedom fighters in Palestine to flip their phones and film horizontal.” She remained unrepentant, dismissing her firing by Red Light Holland and writing: “It’s FREE PALESTINE until Palestine is FREE.” “I’d say supporting Palestine has lost me business opportunities, but I’m more angry at myself for not checking whether or not I was entering into business with Zionists,” she also wrote. “My bad.” She also criticised Kylie Jenner for posting a since-deleted message in support of Israel to her Instagram account, writing, “If true journalism exists, the next person to talk to Kylie Jenner will ask for her opinion on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and not break eye contact until she can string one coherent sentence together since she wants to take a stance to her 400M followers so badly.” Since Saturday, Khalifa has reposted numerous posts to her 5 million followers on X in defence of the war. One statement, reposted to her account from influencer Kelbin, noted that the attacks are “what oppressed fighting the oppressor looks like.” Khalifa, who was banned from her home country of Lebanon, had a meteoric — but not exactly profitable — time in the adult industry in 2014. When she joined Centerfold in February 2022, Playboy highlighted Khalifa’s outspokenness as an asset. “Mia’s fearless, direct, thought-provoking and fun-loving approach to life and her career make her an important addition to our Centerfold community,” PLBY Group CEO Ben Kohn said in a statement at the time. “Freedom of expression is the cornerstone of our Playboy legacy, and our Centerfold is all about empowering creators like Mia to express themselves in a safe, accepting environment.” Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

A man named Peter called radio station 3AW with an unverified report that four men had driven around South Yarra asking about the community and making threats. “Where are the Jews? We want to kill the Jews,” the men allegedly said. Victoria Police have confirmed they spoke to Peter in their investigation into the incident, however, he did not wish to make a formal complaint about it. “Police have spoken to the parties involved and after a thorough investigation, the matter has been determined to the satisfaction of the reporting person,” a Victoria Police spokesperson said. Police could not confirm whether the alleged incident had taken place, just that they had spoken to the man who did not wish to take the issue further. Mitchell later played a short recording of another man who recorded his alleged interaction with the men. The man said four young men in a car had told him “we’re on the hunt to kill Jews”. The allegations have not been verified. “Police have been told a car pulled over near a man on Toorak Rd near Williams Rd when threats were made by occupants of the car about 4pm,” a Victoria Police spokesman said earlier on Wednesday. On Monday night, a small group at a pro-Palestine rally at the Sydney Opera House reportedly chanted “f**k the Jews” and “gas the Jews”, a reference to the Nazi Holocaust that slaughtered more than six million Jews in Europe in the 1940s. NSW Premier Chris Minns condemned the scenes at the Opera House as “abhorrent”. “To have some people celebrate atrocious indiscriminate killing and kidnapping in Israel is appalling,” he said. “This is the opposite of the dynamic multicultural community we want in NSW and Australia.” The group behind the protest has condemned the actions of a “tiny fringe” of 20 “vile anti-Semetic attendees” who were not connected to the rally. “From our observations this occurred for less than one minute and was not an ongoing chant. They were quickly condemned for their chants and asked to leave,” Palestine Action Group Sydney wrote on social media. “Long-standing Palestinian organisers and activists, Palestinian, Arab and Muslim elders attending the protest were disgusted and deplored by the action.” “This is not what our movement stands for.” An Airbnb host is refusing to refund a stay that cost its guests tens of thousands.

The 28-year-old, who has been a longtime advocate for the ‘Free Palestine’ movement alongside her sister Bella Hadid, described theongoing devastation in the regionas an “unjustifiable tragedy”, throwing her support behind Palestine’s struggle while also condemning the violence that had arisen as a result of the attacks. “I have deep empathy for the Palestinian struggle and life under occupation, it’s a responsibility I hold daily,” she wrote. “I also feel a responsibility to my Jewish friends to make it clear, as I have before: While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person. “The terrorising of innocent people is not in alignment with and does not do any good for the ‘Free Palestine’ movement. “The idea that it does has fuelled a painful, decades-long cycle of back and forth retaliation (which no innocent civilian, Palestinian or Israeli, deserves to be a casualty of) and helps perpetuate the false idea that being Pro-Palestine = antisemitic.” Hadid, a mother-of-one, concluded by expressing her condolences to those tied up in the conflict, as she pleaded for the safety of “innocent lives”. “If you are hurting, as I share my condolences today with my loved ones, both Palestinian and Jewish, I’m sending you my love and strength – whoever and wherever you are,” she wrote. “There are a lot of complex, personal, and valid feelings, but every human deserves basic rights, treatment and security; no matter their nationality, religion, ethnicity, or where they were both. “I know my words will never be enough or heal the deep wounds of so many, but I pray for the safety of innocent lives – always.” Hadid switched comments off on the post. Her younger sister Bella, 27, who has regularly used her social media platform to raise awareness for Palestine’s plight, is yet to comment. Their father, multi-millionaire real estate developer Mohamed Hadid, is of Palestinian origin. It comes as the death toll in the region rose to 3000 as of Tuesday, including more than 1000 Israelis. Palestinian militant groupHamas launched the unprecedented attackon Saturday,firing thousands of rockets from Gazaand taking a“significant” number of captives. Israel retaliated by launching a wave of air strikes. On Tuesday, the country imposed a “complete siege” on the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity, food, water and gas to its 2.3 million residents.

Galit Carbone, 66, is believed to have been found outside her home in a kibbutz 5km from the Gaza Strip where more than 100 people were killed. Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong confirmed Ms Carbone, an Australian citizen, had been “murdered” in Hamas’ attacks on Israel. “On behalf of the government, I wish to convey my deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Ms Carbone. DFAT is providing consular assistance to her family in Israel and in Australia,” Senator Wong said in a statement. “Australia unequivocally condemns the attacks on Israel by Hamas. There is no excuse for the deliberate killing of innocent civilians.” There are reports that militants set homes in the Be’eri kibbutz on fire to force residents out of their shelters before murdering some and taking others hostage. The family of the Sydney born mother-of-three, and grandmother of two, and the Australian Jewish community more broadlyare “heartbroken”. Ms Carbone is understood to have moved to Israel to raise her children and was working as a librarian. Ten per cent of the kibbutz she called home were killed in the weekend attack, one of the first places targeted by Hamas when they breached the border on Saturday. Earlier, Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said she was “devastated” by the news. “This is heartbreaking news this morning for the family of (Ms Carbone), her community here in Australia … our hearts absolutely go out to her,” she told Channel 7. “I’m devastated for the people who knew her, but also the broader Jewish Australian community. “We’ve got brothers and sisters of the Jewish religion around our country who are suffering greatly from what is a brutal, violent, abhorrent and completely unjustified act of terrorism against their country and their citizens. “What’s happened here is a senseless act of violence, that will get more violent, and the Australian government condemns it in the strongest possible terms.” She said the government was “standing with” the Jewish community. “We’re … wrapping our arms around you, and I express my deepest condolences for what has happened here,” she said. More than 10,000 Australians live in Israel, and many more are believed to have been visiting the Jewish country when Palestinian militant group Hamas – recognised as a terrorist group by Australia – launched a surprise attack on the weekend. In its attack, Hamas has slaughtered innocent civilians – including children – in an act US President Joe Biden has condemned as “pure evil”. Raz Asher, 4, and Aviv Asher, 2 The sisters and their mother Doron had been spending the last day of Sukkot with family in Kibbutz Nir Oz, in southern Israel, when news broke that the kibbutz had been the target on of one of the most savage attacks. Doron Asher Doron was hiding in a fortified safe room with her two daughters and mother after telling her husband Yoni over the phone that  ""terrorists are in the house"". The next he knows was from a video showing all four in the back of a metal cart, being taken by gunmen. Tracking data on Doron’s phone then showed she was in Khan Younis, a city ­inside Gaza. Debbie and Shlomi Mathias The couple were killed shielding their teenage son, Rotem, with their bodies when Hamas terrorists invaded their home. Their act of bravery saved the 16-year-old, who suffered a bullet wound to his abdomen but survived. Tamar Kedem-Siman Tov, her husband Yonatan and their children Shachar, 6, Arbel, 6, and Omer, 4 The entire family was killed after the bunker they were in was reportedly breached. Israel’s former prime minister Naftali Bennett wrote on X: ""Look at their happy faces. Their love. All of them murdered by Palestinian terrorists at Nir-Oz kibbutz. Just because they’re Jews."" Erez Kalderon, 10 The youngster was snatched from his home in Nir Oz with his fatherOfferand sisterSahar, 16. Itay and Hadar Berdichevsky The Israeli couple were killed in their home, but managed to save their 10-month-old twin babies by placing them in a hidden shelter. Israeli ambassador to Colombia Gali Dagan said: ""Itay and Hadar were brutally murdered after bravely fighting the terrorists. The babies were left alone for more than 12 hours until they were rescued."" Jack Marlowe, 26 The young Briton was working as a security guard at the Supernova music festival where 260 people were killed by invading Hamas militants, and hasn't contacted family. An Israeli embassy spokesman said: ""We don't know for sure that he is taken hostage or dead or in a hospital."" Shiri Bibas, son Ariel, four, and baby Kfir, nine months Having been seized in their Nir Oz home, Shiri Bibas was seen with her children in video as they were taken away by militants. Her husbandYardenand Shiri's fatherYosi, who needs daily medication for Parkinson's, and motherMargit, were also taken. Shani Louk, 22 The graphic designer and tattoo artist was initially reported killed after being abducted from a music festival when the militants struck. Her German mother said she recognised her daughter in videos circulating online of a half-naked woman lying face down in the back of a pick-up truck in Gaza with armed men seated around her and spitting on her. Ricarda Louk has since been told her daughter is alive but critically injured with a severe head injury. Yaffa Adar, 85 The grandmother was bundled into a golf buggy at gunpoint by a group of terrorists. Her granddaughter Adva said the family lost contact with her and later found her home had been burned down. Nathanel Young, 20 Young, from London, had been serving with the IDF when he was killed on the Gaza border. His brother, Eliot Young, said:  ""Nathanel was full of life and the life of the party. He loved his family and friends and was loved by everyone."" Noa Argamani, 25 Noa Argamani, 25, was at the Supernova music festival and was last seen being driven away on a motorcycle as another group of militants held her boyfriend,Avinatan Or, his arm pinned behind his back. She was screaming: ""Don't kill me! No, no, no"", her arms outstretched ­towards her boyfriend. Danny Darlington and Carolin Bohl The British photographer and his German friend died at Nir Oz, family members said. Carolin's family said they had ""reliable information from the ground"" that neither survived Hamas' attack on the kibbutz. Danny's sister Shelley Darlington said: ""My baby brother, Dan, was murdered by terrorists ... Our community has been destroyed."" Inbar Shem Tov, 22 Aharon Shem Tov received a video from his daughter as she hid from attackers in a dumpster with five others. At 8.45am she told him ""everything is OK"", but three hours later texted: ""We are going to die."" That was the last contact. ""Maybe the terrorists took her or she ran away, I don't know,"" Mr Tov said. Lior Asulin, 43 The former Israeli pro soccer player was killed while celebrating his birthday at the Supernova festival. Soccer team Hapoel Tel Aviv said: ""With great sadness, after many hours when he was declared missing, we have been informed that our former player Lior Asulin was murdered by terrorists at the party in Re'im."" Israel has returned fire, launching rockets at Palestine and this week announced a “complete siege” – cutting off all food and electricity from the enclave. Israel has mobilised hundreds of thousands of Israeli reservists in preparation for an anticipated ground offensive, with support from the US. Hamas has taken at least 100 Israelis hostage and has threatened to kill one every time Israel fires a rocket at the enclave. Already, the death toll in Israel has surpassed 1000 with more than 2000 people wounded; and at least 510 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2750 injured. Opposition finance spokeswoman Jane Hume said it was “almost inevitable” that there would be more Australian victims. “We know there are thousands of Jewish Australians in Israel right now,” she said. Senator Wong stood firm in her resolve to call for protection of civilians. “The loss of life from these attacks has been devastating and unacceptable,” she said. “Australia has called for the attacks to stop and for the immediate and unconditional release of all those taken hostage.” Ms O’Neil said the government was doing all it could to keep Australians caught up in the fighting safe. “This is a brutal act of terrorism that was unprovoked and unnecessary. Australians are going to be harmed by this and … we’re working very hard to make sure we protect Australians not just overseas but at home,” she said. Senator Wong said the government was assessing “all options” for Australians wanting to leave. Commercial airlines have cut or cancelled flights out of Israel, prompting calls for the government to organise special repatriation flights. An Australian man, going only by Keanu, told ABC News on Wednesday morning, says he was trying to get out of Israel and pleaded with the government to help. “I feel a bit stranded, especially when I’m seeing constant other repatriation flights coming from other countries. So it would feel a lot safer and a lot more guaranteed to have the Australian government doing those flights for all of the Australians here,” he said. Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza. Dozens of Hamas terrorists have reportedly surrendered to Israeli forces in northern Gaza, with extraordinary photos showing the men stripped to their underwear. The Israeli strike that killed one journalist and injured six others in Lebanon merits a “war crime” investigation.","October 11, 2023 - 9:13AM"
Push to sack Minister after protest chaos,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/nsw-premier-chris-minns-apologises-for-propalestinian-protests-cops-to-block-second-rally/news-story/be09a23c708c727bf76229678d4c7d3c,"The NSW Police Minister Yasmin Catley is facing calls for her to be sacked over her handling of Monday night’s chaos, in which protesters stormed the Sydney Opera House Forecourt while chanting anti-Semitic phrases. Opposition Leader Mark Speakman questioned why Ms Catley didn’t “probe” police to cancel Monday’s protests, or work with community leaders, or advise people to not attend the rally. “We ask the Premier to replace the current minister with someone who is up to the job,” he said. “There’s no evidence she even asked the police to stop it happening or asked why it couldn’t happen. “When we’ve got a threat of increased tension around the world, (and) increased community tensions here, you need a minister who is at the top of her job and this minister, I regret to say, is not.” During parliament on Wednesday, Ms Catley offered an apology to NSW‘s Jewish community, after being pressed to do so by the Opposition. “We have the responsibility to ensure the safety of multicultural communities in NSW, and especially the Jewish community, who deserve to feel safe,” she said. “Of course I apologise to anyone if they feel unsafe.” However, her response was also criticised by the Opposition Leader. “Even today she gave the most grudging apology: ‘Well I’m sorry if you feel unsafe’. (It was) not a proper apology to the Jewish community for what had happened,” Mr Speakman said. On Wednesday, NSW Premier Chris Minns said a second Free Palestine march planned for Sunday would be called off, after hundreds of protesters caused chaos outside the Opera House on Monday. In a press conference on Wednesday, the Premier apologised to the state’s Jewish community for failing to provide a safe place to mourn following devastating attacks launched by terrorists over the weekend. “I really want to make it clear to the Jewish community that I want to apologise to them, specifically, on behalf of the government and myself as the Premier of NSW,” he said. “The intentions were to light up the Opera House as a space for the Jewish community to commemorate what happened in Israel, the number of family and friends caught up in the conflict. “We didn't do it. I take responsibility for that. I want to ensure it won’t happen again.” Tense protests on Monday night, organised by the Palestine Action Group Sydney, saw protesters go from the Town Hall to the Opera House where protesters burnt the Israeli flag, made anti-Semitic chants and set off flares in the Forecourt. The activist group had organised a second rally for this Sunday and have submitted paper work attempting to obtain permission for a march, however the Premier said he expected the application would be denied. “The protest organisers have already proven they're not peaceful. Shouting racial epithets is not the definition of a peaceful protest,” he said. “The idea they’re going to commandeer Sydney streets is not going to happen, and I am sure NSW Police will make that clear this morning.” Palestine Action Group Sydney organiser Josh Lees said the group still planned to gather at Town Hall, and were currently seeking legal advice and working with police to consider their options. Mr Lees said he was not aware they would not be able to march prior to Wednesday morning’s announcements. “Obviously we’d like to march, it’s our democratic right but we have a right to a peaceful assembly and we’ll be going ahead with that,” he said. “It’s very important we continue protesting given the war crimes happening on the Gaza Strip right now. There’s a lot of talk about the terrible loss of civilian lives but right now there’s thousands of Palestinians being killed and we need to protest for their lives as well.” In a statement shared on the group’s social media, organisers confirmed they were still proceeding with a demonstration on Sunday. “While pretending to care about the loss of civilian lives, Israel is busy murdering hundreds of civilians, including children and whole families, in the Gaza Strip,” the statement said. “In (Israeli President Benjamin) Netanyahu’s words, they ‘are only just getting started’. “This is why we must protest, and why we’ll be back 1pm Sunday at Town Hall.” Asked whether police will be able to stop any ad hoc marches on Sunday, the Premier said NSW Police “will have more to say about it” later on Wednesday. Mr Minns was said it was important to ensure people didn’t conflate NSW’s “massive and engaged Muslim community as being ubiquitous or in solidarity with the scenes that we saw on the Opera House Forecourt”. “I know that many members of the Jewish community have tight, strong and long bond with members of the Muslim community, who have been appalled,” he said. Extra police and security will be present at Jewish synagogues, schools, hospitals and retirement villages in response to widespread local protests over the violent conflicts in Israel. Speaking about the extra security measures offered to the Jewish community, Acting NSW Police Commissioner David Hudson confirmed no direct threats had been issued. This comes after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a terror attack on Israeli civilians, leading to more than 1000 fatalities. “I know there’s a lot of angst within the Jewish community. I understand that,” he said. “We don’t have any information or direct threats at this stage, and a lot of our visibility and presence is about preventing that.” The extra measures will be implemented in the newly established Operation Shelter, which will focus on co-ordinated NSW Police‘s responses in relation to community sentiment, protest activity and demonstrations. Deputy Commissioner David Hudson said the taskforce will monitor all Form Ones which give permission for protest groups to march on streets, plus offer extra resources to police and increase police visibility in the community. Overseeing the operation, Deputy Commissioner Mel Lanyon said the level of security will depend on intelligence received by police. “What we’ve said is very clearly that we will support all communities to be able to live safely in,” he said. “At the moment we understand that there is very reasonable fear within the Jewish community. We have certainly accelerated the proactive patrols we‘re doing within that community.” The increased police initiative was implemented following an unauthorised pro-Palestinian demonstration which organisers Palestine Action Group Sydney have said will go ahead. Commissioner Hudson told protesters to stay away from Sydney’s Town Hall at 1pm Sunday, after Monday’s “abhorrent” demonstration which saw attendees chant anti-Semitic phrases and burn the Israeli flag outside the Sydney Opera House. “If people show up on Sunday if that‘s the date that the organisers persist with, that will be met by a strong police force,” he said. “We will propose that those that attend on Sunday, if the event goes ahead, would be subject to policing activities and identification of offences, and they will be charged if those offences are identified.” Although police are not able to prevent protesters from gathering at the Town Hall, the Form One application that will allow protesters to march will be refused on the groups it was not made seven days prior to Sunday’s event. This means attendees will not be protected from certain offences like obstruction of traffic, or walking on the roadways. “I would urge anyone who was considering attending Town Hall … to monitor the situation closely,” he said. “We will be doing further communications or closer to the time frame once negotiations with those organisers have been resolved.” Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza. Dozens of Hamas terrorists have reportedly surrendered to Israeli forces in northern Gaza, with extraordinary photos showing the men stripped to their underwear.

Family says Israel festival victim is ‘alive’,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/shani-louk-hamas-festival-victim-is-alive-according-to-her-mother/news-story/1c045853c7885bd56fa3fa5e0038645d,"Warning: Graphic A young German-Israeli tattoo artist thought to have been murdered by Hamas militants is still alive, according to her mother. Shani Louk, 22, was presumed dead after disturbing footage of her naked and limp body being driven by militants into Palestinian territory went viral. She wasabducted from the Supernova festivalon Saturday, which was brutally attacked by Hamas militants, leaving at least260 people dead. The attackers paraded her body through the streets on a flatbed truck, screaming, “Allahu Akbar (God is great)”. However, on Tuesday her mother, Ricarda, claimed to have been tipped off by an unidentified Palestinian source that her daughter was actually in a hospital. Ricarda Louk told German news outlet Bild that she believed her daughter was in a Gaza hospital with serious head injuries. “We now have evidence that Shani is alive but has a serious head injury and is in critical condition. Every minute is critical,” she told Bild. “We are not getting any information from the authorities here. Peace activists have told us that Shani will now only get help if the German authorities officially intervene.” Her family identified Shani ina brutal videothat circulated online in the early hours of the fighting between Israel and Hamas. It showedShani’s body - with her distinctive tattoos and dreadlocks - being paradedand spat on in the back of a Hamas pick-up truck. The family was also alerted to Louk’s credit card allegedly being used in Gaza on Sunday, theDaily Beastadded. A family friend in the Gaza Strip thinks the young woman is now in the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, but has not been able to visit, another family acquaintance told Spiegel. Louk has never lived in Germany, but travelled there frequently to visit her maternal grandparents, Spiegel noted. Her family — including her mother, who converted to Judaism from Catholicism, and her father, who is Israeli — live about 80 kilometres from the Gaza Strip, the outlet said. Louk’s aunt, Orly Louk, told German news outletDer Spiegelthat her niece had grown up in Israel, but was a globetrotting pacifist who refused to perform the military service that is mandatory for Israelis. She said the last photo Louk posted on social media was a selfie before she headed to the festival near Kibbutz Re’im. “She often posted selfies on Instagram,” Orly Louk told the outlet as she held out hope that her niece is still alive. Louk was at a music festival close to the Gaza Strip on Saturday when Hamas attackers swarmed the event,killing at least 260those in the crowd and taking many others hostage. Shani’s mother earlier said her daughter was trying to leave the event when the terrorists launched their surprise attack in the Negev Desert. “She was panicked a little bit, and she said she was going to take the car now and go to a safe location. And then we stopped talking and since then I didn’t hear anything from her anymore,” she said. The development comes after a heartbreaking video published in theNew York Postcaptured Louk joyfully dancing at the festival moments before the attack. The video was posted when Shani was assumed to be among the murdered, with it being described as “probably the last moments of her before Hamas attacked music festival.” About 3,500 young people attended the Supernova music festival, which was among the first targets of Hamas gunmen. Video footage from the festival shared online showed thegunmen descending in paragliderson the gathering while others came by road. Hamas fighters opened fire on the revellers who had reportedly come together to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Sukkot with an electronic music festival. Israeli first responders posted videos to the social media site Telegram showing armed men plunging into the panicked crowd, mowing down fleeing revellers with bursts of automatic fire. Many victims were shot in the back as they ran. Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

Aussie vows to join fight against Hamas,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/bold-decision-after-australianisraeli-woman-supposed-to-be-at-israel-festival/news-story/26c2cb339c1c292774f5aba970a28ba7,"An Australian-Israeli woman has decided to join the fight against Hamas militants after she was supposed to attend a music festival where hundreds were killed. Mai Gutman, who was born in Israel and moved to Melbourne when she was 18 months old, was planning on attending the Supernova Music Festival where 260 people were killed after gunmen on trucks and motorcycles stormed the area on Saturday. However, she later made the decision to spend the day with family in Jerusalem. Speaking toA Current Affair,the 28-year-old revealed the panicked text messages she received in a WhatsApp group with festival goers on Saturday morning. “My phone started pinging from a WhatsApp group saying ‘help us, help us’,” she told the program on Tuesday night. “All these different girls were texting … ‘they’re coming at us, they’re shooting at us, my friend is dead, people are dying there are bodies everywhere. Help me, I’m hurt.’” Ms Gutman said people were begging for other to call the police or an ambulance but she said there was “no one to call”. “To think that could have been me, to think my friends were there, to think that these people were just young people my age who just went to have a good time. “You wouldn’t think … that’s where your life would end.” Despite having the choice to return home to her family in Australia, Ms Gutman said she has a “moral imperative” to be in Israel and fight. “Every single person that we know has lost someone in the past couple of days. To be trembling in front of the news waiting to hear the name of a loved one come across the screen it’s just terrifying.” With the conflict raging on, she said she doesn’t have the luxury or time to “be scared” and “have a cry”. “I think if I took the moment to sit down and internalise what’s really going on I think there would be an element of fear, but living in Israel and living in a period of such heightened tension I don’t have the luxury.” With her bags packed, Ms Gutman, a trained combat soldier, is currently on standby waiting for a call to join reservists and fight against the Palestinian militant group. “If things heat up in the north then I’ll be sent there,” she said. “I’m kind of like a sitting duck at the moment. There’s not much that we can really do. We can go give blood, there are food drives … but there’s really nothing else I can do apart from wait and hope that things either die down or that I will be needed in a way.” Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, launched an extensive air, sea and land attack on Israel on Saturday, coinciding with the Jewish holiday Simchat Torah. Israel said it had recaptured Gaza border areas from Hamas militants on Tuesday, as the death toll from the conflict passed 3000, including more than a thousand Israelis. The Israeli army has called up 300,000 reservists and massed tanks and other heavy armour both near Gaza and on the northern border with Lebanon. – With AFP Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

It comes after Hamas launched an extensive multi-pronged attack against Israel on Saturday, catching the country’s intelligence agenciescompletely off guard. Thousands of rockets were fired from Gaza while militants infiltrated Israeli communities,massacring hundredsandabducting some 150 hostages. Israel has retaliated by launching a wave of air strikes for the bloody incursion and yesterday imposed a “complete siege” on the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity, food, water and gas to its 2.3 million residents. Israel is now threatening a ground invasion as more than 300,000 reservists are called up. Hamas has warned it will begin broadcasting the execution of hostages if Israel targets “innocent civilians”, with 200 targets in Gaza hit in one night alone. Follow our live coverage of the conflict below. ... Gaza’s only power station goes dark The only power plant in the Gaza Strip, which is under Israeli bombardment and siege, shut down on Wednesday after it ran out of fuel, the Palestinian enclave’s electricity authority said. “The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped functioning at 2pm (local time),” the authority’s head, Jalal Ismail, said in a statement, having earlier warned that it was running short of fuel. It means Gaza’s population of roughly two million people is now without power, with the exception of what can be provided by private generators. ‘Worse than ISIS’: Israeli PM shares horrific image The Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has shared a photograph of what appears to be a child’s bed covered in blood, citing it as proof that Hamas is “worse than ISIS”. Hamas is worse than ISIS.pic.twitter.com/mK76MJWGsw Gaza man loses eight family members A Gaza resident has lost eight members of his family, including his pregnant wife, as a result of Israel’s attacks on the region. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Ala al-Kafarneh is the only survivor of an Israeli air raid that killed his family, who are some of the 1050 now confirmed dead after the retaliatory attacks. “We received a message to leave Beit Hanoon town, so we went to the beach refugee camp. They threatened the building we were in, so we went to find safety,” he said. “But the building we were in was also threatened so we had to move to Sheikh Radwan town where we stayed in an apartment. Around 4am, a strike hit us. We don’t know why. We have done nothing.” Gaza hospitals on the brink Hospitals in Gaza are becoming increasingly overwhelmed and face shortages in crucial medical supplies. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warned that without power, the situation will deteriorate rapidly for healthcare workers and patients, as Israel’s retaliation continues through Wednesday. Executive director of MSF-USA Avril Benoît said the aid agency was “seeing shortages of water, electricity, and fuel, which hospitals rely on for their generators”. “Some hospitals only have enough fuel for four days,” she said. Israel launches 250 airstrikes in just one hour into “Nest of Terror”. Forces unleashed 250 airstrikes in just one hour early on Wednesday, Fox News’ Trey Yingst reported. The IDF said the area hit is a “Nest of Terror” used by Hamas miltants to launch attacks against Israel. Dozens of buildings were reduced to rubble - leaving unknown numbers of bodies beneath mounds of debris as residents scrambled to find safety. Albanese announces repatriation flights Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has told Australians in Israel they will have the option to fly home on Friday. The Federal Government is reportedly in talks with Qantas and Virgin to offer repatriation flights to Israel to help those who wish to flee the region. “Australians who want to leave Israel on our assisted departure flights must register with the Australian government’s 24-hour consular emergency centre,” he said. “We are assessing all options to get Australians home as soon as possible who wish to travel back here. “We have been working on these contingencies over recent times and will continue to do so across the range of issues as a result of the appalling and abhorrent attacks by Hamas that we saw on the weekend.” Graphic images as Israel continues extraction Israeli workers are still removing dead bodies from the city of Sderot, four days after the city was attacked by Hamas. The Israeli death toll has risen past 1,200 on Wednesday, while the Palestinian health ministry says 1,055 people have been killed over 5,100 others injured since Israel‘s retaliation. Thousands attend Sydney vigil for Israel attacks Thousands are attending a vigil organised by Sydney’s Jewish community tocommemorate the deaths of more than a thousand Israeli civiliansafter the weekend’s shock attack from Palestinian militant group Hamas. Organisers said by 6pm, close to 5000 attendees had flooded Rodney Reserve in Dover Heights in Sydney’s east. Couple Danielle Chaanger and Gioel Gottlieb, both of whom are Jewish, said they had been “devastate and crushed” at the Hamas attack. “This morning I went to my doctor and my doctor’s wife sister had been shot. She barricaded herself in the house, but they kidnapped her neighbours and killed her baby,” he said. He said he was at the vigil in a show of support for Israel. “We are not here to protest. We’re here to show that we are very different. We’re here to unite ourselves because we love each other,” he said. Gaza power plant on brink of shutdown Gaza’s power plant, the only source of electricity in the embattled region, will run out of fuel within hours as Israel continues its total siege. Head of the Palestinian Energy Authority Thafer Melhem told Voice of Palestine radio that Gaza could be completely without power in just three hours. Israel has also also vowed to cut off the region from food, fuel and water supplies in an effort to choke Hamas. Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general, said over a dozen healthcare workers had been killed or injured over the past two days of retaliation. “Damage to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities has undermined services to more than 400,000 people,” Mr Dujarric said via the BBC. “The Gaza Power Plant is now the only source of electricity and could run out of fuel within days.” Israel retaliates after Hezbollah attack The IDF conducted retaliatory strikes on Lebanon on Wednesday in response to missile attacks originating from Lebanese territory aimed at an Israeli military position at the border. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the missile launches, claiming they had caused “a large number of confirmed casualties”. The attack occurred near the Israeli town of Arab al-Aramshe, across from the Lebanese village of Dhayra on Wednesday. Residents of the southern Lebanese town of Rmeish reported Israeli shelling in their vicinity as Israeli artillery shells targeted the rocket launch point near Dhayra. The IDF confirmed it is carrying out the strikes and and has not yet provided information on casualties. Waleed Aly emotional over Palestine crisis Waleed Aly was on the verge of tears on The Project on Wednesday night, while reporting on the massacre in Israel. The Project host was presenting a piece on an Australian-born woman, Galit Carbone, who was found dead outside her home in a kibbutz 5km from the Gaza Strip where more than 100 people, including babies, were killed. “They’re just kids. It is a lot isn’t it,” an emotional Aly said. “This as been hard to cope with. We understand we need to cover it. We are glad to say there has been some good news, not on this story, but on other stories that we can bring.” Man distraught as partner still missing from festival The boyfriend of an Israeli woman still missing after attending the music festival stormed by bloodthirsty Hamas terrorists said he is living in agony after deciding to skip the rave at the last minute. “I feel like I needed to go and be there with her. Maybe I could have done something different,” Ohad Malul said in an interview with theNew York Post. “It’s killing me inside that I am not with her.” His girlfriend of two years, Shani Kupervaser, has not been seen or heard from since she fled the Tribe of Nova event in the Negev Desert with friends and was attacked by Hamas fighters with grenades and gunfire. “We don’t know if she is alive, dead or if she is missing. We don’t know if she is kidnapped because nobody told us,” Malul said. Kupervaser — a 27-year-old economics student who had a job lined up for after graduation — went to the Nova festival with six friends, but Malul said he decided not to go since he was tired after just getting back from a trip to Paris. “She said ‘I will come back, I won’t go for long … Everything is going to be OK’,” he said. Kupervaser became separated from her friends once Hamas fighters turned the festival ground into a battlefield, according to her friends’ accounts. “It is something that you can’t imagine, them throwing grenades in a small room just to kill everyone,” Malul said, adding that another one of her friends who she fled with is missing. “The other people who survived can almost not talk. They are devastated.” Israel death toll rises to 1,200, Gaza 950 More than 1,200 Israelis have been killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict, an Israeli Defence Forces spokesperson said Wednesday, up from 1,000 previously reported. “The death toll is a staggering 1,200 dead Israelis,” IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said in a video message, adding that “the overwhelming majority of them” were civilians. It comes as electricity service to Gaza “will completely stop within hours” as Israeli forces continue to rain down airstrikes. On Wednesday, the Gaza Ministry of Health said 950 people have been killed and 5,000 others have been wounded in the strikes. “All basic services in Gaza depend on electricity, and it will not be possible to partially operate them with generators due to the prevention of fuel supplies through the Rafah gate,” the Gaza government media office said in a statement. Over 263,000 people have been displaced in the region following the Israeli airstrikes, with that number “expected to rise further,” the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Wednesday. “This is increasing the caseload for humanitarian organisations to meet displaced people’s basic needs of shelter, bedding, food, water and sanitation facilities,” the UN agency said. Palestine responds as civilians injured in strikes The Palestinian Ministry of Interior Affairs reported airstrikes have pounded residential neighbourhoods situated in the eastern part of Jabalia and the Qizan al-Najjar region on the Gaza Strip. The strikes were aimed at civilian residences and infrastructure caused “direct injuries among citizens”, according to a statement from the ministry early on Wednesday. The Israel Defense Forces have not yet issued statements regarding the airstrikes. Tens of thousands of Israeli troops have now mobilised as the nation prepares for a possible ground operation. Defence minister Yoav Gallant said he has “released all restraints” on the IDF as the region prepares for another bloody escalation. “Whoever comes to decapitate, murder women, Holocaust survivors — we will eliminate him at the height of our power and without compromise,” he said. Israeli mother lashed out on TV An Israeli mother whose children wereabducted by Hamaslashed out after being asked about the fate of Gazans being pounded by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Speaking on MSNBC with host Andrea Mitchell, the Israeli woman was visibly irritated when asked about Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip, theNew York Postreports. “I can’t be sympathetic to animal human beings — well, they’re not really human beings — who came into my house, broke everything, stole everything, took my children from their bedrooms and took them to the Gaza Strip,” she responded. “Israel never done that, and it will never do. So there is no symmetry! I’m sorry.” She added: “If you were dealing with a war who is between two countries, countries don’t take children hostages. I’m sorry. It’s against the laws of war. It’s against humanity. It’s against anything that we all believe in.” Over 260,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the Gaza Strip, as heavy Israeli bombardments from the air, land and sea continue to hit the Palestinian enclave, the United Nations said. Israel has imposed what it called a “complete siege” on the already blockaded Gaza Strip, cutting off food, water, fuel and electricity. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the move would worsen an already dire humanitarian situation. Hamas took control of Gaza after the 2006 Palestinian legislative election — the last time elections were held. Israel strikes Gaza’s Rafah border Explosions rocked Gaza City on Tuesday night (local time). For the third time in 24 hours, an Israeli air strike hit Gaza’s Rafah border crossing with Egypt, an AFP photographer and an NGO said. White smoke billowed from among fishing boats after an air strike on Gaza’s port, and in Jerusalem the deserted streets were targeted by Hamas rocket fire. “Israeli people they are scared of the Arabs and the Arabs are scared of the Jews... everybody is scared of each other,” said Ahmed Karkash, a shop owner in the Old City. In Gaza City, streets are clogged with rubble and littered with shards of glass. Mazen Mohammad and his family slept on the ground floor of their apartment block, huddling together as explosions rang out around them. What they woke up to the next day was unrecognisable. “We felt like we were in a ghost town, as if we were the only survivors,” Mohammad, 38, told AFP. Missiles launched from Lebanon and Syria There are growing fears the clash between Israel and Gaza couldescalate into a wider conflict, with munitions fired from both Lebanon and Syria into northern Israel, sparking a response from the IDF. Fifteen rockets were fired from Lebanon at Western Galilee on Tuesday (local time), theTimes of Israelreports. Four of those were intercepted by Israel’s “Iron Dome” defence system, while the rest landed without damaging buildings or causing injuries. Mortars were also fired from Syria at the Golan Heights, an area seized by Israel from Syria during the Six-Day War of 1967. The IDF reportedly retaliated by launching shells at posts in both Lebanon and Syria. The “war” between Israel and Gaza is taking place in the south of Israel, with thousands of troops massing near Gaza. The IDF is poised to mount a ground invasion. But the IDF has also been bolstered in the north to deter hostile nations and proxy forces from joining the conflict. The United States is also taking actions to prevent other actors from getting involved. The US moved the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean specifically as a “deterrent signal to Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, and any other proxy across the region who might be considering exploiting the current situation to escalate the conflict,” a senior official told reporters. Israel is surrounded by nations that have never officially recognised Israel, including Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman.

Israeli soldiers said they discovered the horrifying aftermath in the town of Kfar Aza, near the border with Gaza. “I’ve been talking to some of the soldiers, and they say what they’ve witnessed as they’ve been walking through these houses, these communities – babies, their heads cut off. That is what they said,” i24 News journalist Nicole Zedek reported, her voice shaking. “Families gunned down in their beds. You can see some of these soldiers now, comforting each other, many of them reserves, many of whom left their own families behind, not knowing the sheer horror they were going to come to. “They say they’ve never experienced anything like this, this is not something anyone ever could have imagined. “About 40 babies at least were taken out on gurneys. They are going house to house still taking out dead bodies.” Fox News reporter Trey Yingst wrote: “Imagine the worst things possible that can be done to humans. Hamas did all of that and more to Israeli civilians. Babies beheaded. People burned alive in their homes. Women raped and dragged through the streets. Don’t look away.” IDF ‘unable to confirm reports’ Israeli Defense Force spokesman LTC (Res) Jonathan Conricus said that he was unable to confirm the “sickening” reports of beheadings. “I have heard the reports. I have been chilled by the reports,’’ he told Sky News Australia. “At this age. I cannot confirm it. Sadly, I don’t think it would be beneath them to do even such monstrosity, but at this stage I cannot confirm it. “The pictures are sickening. I mean I’ve been around military business for many years and I’ve seen my share of things that I would rather not have seen. It’s became like something from an beyond our ability to comprehend.” His comments follow reports that Israeli soldiers found the decapitated corpses of babies at Kfar Aza, a kibbutz near Gaza. A spokesman, Major Nir Dinar, did not say how many babies’ bodies had been found, nor how many had been beheaded. “These people [Hamas] are animals,” Dinar said. “They have butchered women and children in worse ways than ISIS.” Family of woman paraded by Hamas say she’s ‘alive’ A young German-Israeli tattoo artist thought to have been murdered by Hamas militants is still alive, according to her mother. Shani Louk, 22, was presumed dead after disturbing footage of her naked and limp body being driven by militants into Palestinian territory went viral. She was abducted from the Supernova festival on Saturday, which was brutally attacked by Hamas militants, leaving at least 260 people dead. The attackers paraded her body through the streets on a flatbed truck, screaming, “Allahu Akbar (God is great)”. Her mother, Ricarda, claimed to have been tipped off by an unidentified Palestinian source that her daughter was actually in a hospital. Read more here. Australian woman first confirmed casualty Sydney-born woman Galit Carbone is believed to be the first Australian killed in the bloodshed in Israel. The 66-year-old grandmother waskilled in her homein the Be’eri kibbutz in southern Israel, about 5km from the Gaza Strip border. Ms Carbone was killed when Hamas militants targeted homes, setting them on fire to smoke out inhabitants. Julian Cappe, a cousin of Ms Carbone, said her family was “numb” after learning her body had been found outside her home, theAustralianreports. About 100 people are believed to have been killed in the raid on the kibbutz. A number of Australians are still missing in Israel since the conflict broke out on Saturday, with fears they may be among the dead. Defence Minister Richard Marles said there was about 10,000 Australians in Israel but the Department of Foreign Affairs has not confirmed any deaths. ‘Sheer evil’: Biden’s emotional speech US President Joe Biden said Washington stood by its ally Israel and was ready to deploy more military assets to the region as he condemned the attacks by Hamas in a speech on Wednesday morning. Mr Biden said Hamas had carried out atrocities including murders of entire families and rapes of women, along with “stomach-turning reports of babies being killed”. “There are moments in this life — I mean this literally — when a pure unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world,” he said. “This is an act of sheer evil.” Mr Biden confirmed at least 14 Americans were dead and a number had been taken hostage by Hamas, which has threatened to kill hostages if Israel did not warn civilians of upcoming attacks on Gaza. Mr Biden said the US would support Israel “today, tomorrow, as we always have” and issued one word to any adversaries of Israel who might get involved: “Don’t”. Rocket fire rains down after deadline passes Earlier, Hamas gave the Israeli city Ashkelon a deadline of 5pm, local time, for residents to evacuate. That deadline has now passed, and the city is being showered with rockets. Hamas gives city two hours to evacuate “In response to the enemy’s crime of displacing our people and forcing them to flee their homes in several areas of the Gaza Strip, we give the residents of the occupied city of Ashkelon a deadline to leave it before 5pm this evening,” a spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing, Al Qassam Brigades, said in a statement. Massive push to arm Israeli civilians Israel’s National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has announced a push to buy 10,000 rifles to arm “civilian security teams” across the country. “We will turn the world upside down so that towns are protected,” he said, according toThe Times of Israel. “I have given instructions for massively arming the civilian security team.” The policy is focused on towns that have “civilian security teams linked to Israel’s border police force”. Israel recaptures border towns Israel said it had recaptured border areas from Hamas militants on Tuesday, as the death toll from the conflict passed 3000, including more than a thousand Israelis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israel’s military campaign is only the start of a sustained war to destroy Hamas and “change the Middle East”. Hamas gunmen killed more than 100 people in the kibbutz of Beeri alone, said Moti Bukjin, a volunteer with the charity Zaka, which recovers bodies in accordance with Jewish law. “They shot everyone,” he told AFP. “They murdered in cold blood children, babies, old people. Everyone.” The Israeli army has called up 300,000 reservists for its “Swords of Iron” campaign and massed tanks and other heavy armour, both near Gaza and on the northern border with Lebanon, where the militant group Hezbollah wields immense influence. Threat to kill hostages The United States, a key ally of Israel, which has reported 11 of its own citizens killed in the spiralling conflict, stressed its full support for Israel, as did Britain, France, Germany and Italy. Their leaders said they recognised the “legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people” but said Hamas “offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed”, in a joint statement. The five Western powers and many other nations have reported citizens killed, abducted or missing, also including Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Nepal, Panama, Paraguay, Russia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Ukraine. Hamas has held around 150 hostages since its ground incursion, among them children, elderly and young people who were captured at a music festival where some 270 died. On Monday, Hamas warned it would start killing hostages every time Israel launches a strike on a civilian target in Gaza without warning. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply distressed” by the siege announcement and warned Gaza’s already dire humanitarian situation will now “only deteriorate exponentially”. UN human rights chief Volker Turk said Tuesday that imposing “sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law”. – with AFP To join the conversation, pleaselog in.Don't have an account?Register Join the conversation, you are commenting asLogout A young dad was walking along a beach with his  daughter when he suffered a medical episode and fell face first, suffocating to death.

Two hours to leave: Countdown to terror,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/israel-gaza-war-live-updates/news-story/f5bc6fe8cd298c19691f64340a5e6a14,"Israel is in a “war to ensure our existence” after Hamas militants launched a devastating attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says, warning “difficult days are still ahead of us”. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group which rules the Gaza Strip, launched an extensive multi-pronged attack against Israel on Saturday, catching the country’sintelligence agenciescompletely off-guard.Thousands of rockets were fired from Gaza while militants infiltrated Israeli communities, massacring hundreds and abducting some 150 hostages. Israel launched a wave of air strikes in retaliation for thebloody incursionand has imposed a “complete siege” on the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity, food, water and gas to its 2.3 million people. Israel is threatening a ground invasion as more than 300,000 reservists are called up. Hamas has warned it will begin broadcasting the executionof hostagesif Israel targets “innocent civilians”, with 200 targets in Gaza hit in one night alone. Follow our live coverage. Total siege of Gaza ‘prohibited’ under international law: UN Israel’s total siege of the Gaza Strip, depriving civilians of goods essential for survival, is banned under international law, the United Nations human rights chief said on Tuesday. Volker Turk called for all sides instead to defuse the “explosive powder-keg situation”, as Israel warned of a sustained war to destroy the Palestinian militant group Hamas. “We know from bitter experience that vengeance is not the answer, and ultimately innocent civilians pay the price,” Turk said. Hamas threatened to execute the hostages if Israeli air strikes continue “targeting” Gaza residents without warning. The threat came after Israel on Monday imposed a total siege on the Gaza Strip, cutting off food, water and electricity supplies. “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” Turk said in a statement. The siege risks seriously compounding the already dire human rights and humanitarian situation in Gaza, the statement said. Hamas gives Israeli citizens two hours to flee Hamas has warned residents of the Israeli city of Ashkelon to leave before 5pm. “In response to the enemy’s crime of displacing our people and forcing them to flee their homes in several areas of the Gaza Strip, we give the residents of the occupied city of Ashkelon a deadline to leave it before 5pm this evening,” an Al Qassam Brigades statement on social media said. Brave act saves woman from Hamas A terrified reveller who drove at a gunman as she escaped the music festival massacre said: “He was shooting like crazy with murder in his eyes.” Noa Beer, 29, had three injured strangers and a DJ in her Jeep as she accelerated when another killer lifted his rifle to fire while the indiscriminate slaughter of innocents continued around them in the desert. Music agent Noa toldThe Sunhow they bundled in after she ­realised they were ringed by gunmen — and said: “I thought I was going to die. I felt so helpless. I am so angry.” Tel Aviv-based Noa, raised in Hampstead, North London, ran to her Jeep with Hungarian DJ Wegha, who she had booked. Music agent Noa told The Sun how they bundled in after she ­realised they were ringed by gunmen — and said: “I thought I was going to die. I felt so helpless. I am so angry.” She spoke out as it emerged 260 people had been killed at the festival, which was devoted to peace. Footage emerged of partygoers hiding in orchards as gunshots rang out. Tel Aviv-based Noa, raised in Hampstead, North London, ran to her Jeep with Hungarian DJ Wegha, who she had booked. They screeched out of the car park only to be confronted by eight terrorists spraying fleeing crowds with bullets. Noa, whose family live in Manchester, said: “Two cars in front crashed when a motorcyclist ahead of them was shot. “I stopped and opened the door to help him but bullets were flying. “I glanced up and there was a gunman 20 metres away. He was firing like crazy straight at me, looking into my eyes. I yelled at the DJ to get out of the car and take cover. We hid behind the car doors as people from the cars in front who had not been killed crawled towards us. “Then a bullet flew past me from the other way. I thought it was soldiers firing back, but to my horror it was four more terrorists, they were all around us, we had nowhere to go. “They were shooting from all directions so hiding behind the car doors was pointless. “I yelled, ‘Everyone get in the car’. It was a split-second ­decision. We leapt back in and three strangers with gunshot wounds also jumped in. “I was so scared. There was a terrorist straight ahead, shooting like crazy with ­murder in his eyes. “In about ten seconds I saw more death than ever in my life. I reversed at speed and span the car around. “Bullets were slamming into our Jeep but amazingly none of them hit the windows. “Cars in front of us were careering off the road because the gunmen were aiming at the drivers — and then the passengers when they got out and tried to run away. “But I didn’t have any choice other than to drive through the gunmen. There was one looking me dead in the eyes and lifting the gun to shoot us. “I started driving towards him. I put my foot down and drove fast. He shot at us from maybe only two metres away and barely missed the window. “I continued driving while the back of the car was still being shot and didn’t look back. I drove as fast as I could and didn’t stop.” Israel sends terrifying text to people of Gaza Israel has texted civilians in Gaza warning them to flee south to Egypt as it prepares for an all-out ground assault to “crush” Hamas. It follows another night of devastating air raids in the territory as the death toll of the bloody war rose to 3,000. Israel’s army has massed tanks, artillery and thousands of elite commandos ready for a ground invasion,The Sunreports. It also reportedly begun laying mines as it blockades the Gaza Strip, cutting off food, water and electricity. Today military spokesman Richard Hecht said civilians should try to leave through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. However the army later issued a clarification saying the crossing was closed, meaning no one can go in or out. The warning comes as Israel prepares to unleash its revenge with the first of 300,000 troops arriving on the border ready for a full-scale ground invasion. ‘Don’t interrupt me’: ABC star in awkward clash with Palestinian activist ABC’s Sarah Ferguson has an awkward on-air clash with Dr Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian activist, as he accused her of ‘bias’ in a fiery discussion about the Hamas-Israel war. The 7.30 host was interviewing the academic on Tuesday night and brought up the hostages, including children, taken by Hamas. “You cannot be biased to one side,” Dr Barghouti replied. “You should have mentioned before this whole thing started, Israel killed 248 Palestinians, civilian Palestinians, in the West Bank including 40 children. “They continue to kill Palestinians in the West Bank, where there is no attack from Hamas. “You never report that. You never report that because it is only as if Israeli lives matter.” The ABC star then replied saying “no one is disputing live are all equally important”. As the tense discussion continued, Ferguson brought up civilian casualties during the war. “If we know Hamas have used civilian areas both to launch rocket attacks into Israel and use as positions for their military operations, if Hamas does that, does that not make them also responsible for what happens if there are attacks from Israel?” she asked. Annoyed at being cut off from his point, the activist then unleashed at the presenter. “Do you want me to answer you without interruption or you will keep interrupting me?” he asked. “Please don’t interrupt me. You just say something wrong.” Hamas’ chilling child hostage threat Hundreds of innocent civilians, including children, are believed to have been taken hostage in Israel by Hamas - forcing the Jewish state into a desperate race to find and free them as the terror group threatened Monday to execute captives. Israeli authorities have not yet provided specific details about the number and identities of the kidnapped victims, however, a preliminary assessment shared by one senior military official with insiders saying at least 150 people have been captured. Among them are 5-year-old Raz and 3-year-old Aviv, their devastated father, Yoni Asher, revealed Monday, theNew York Postreports. Asher’s entire world came crashing down Saturday when he recognised his girls and their mother in a video circulating on social media showing abducted Israelis being forced on a flatbed truck, surrounded by men with guns. He had last spoken to his wife, Doron Asher Katz, 34, earlier that day when she phoned him from her mom’s place in southern Israel, according to Bloomberg. “She told me terrorists had infiltrated the home,” he told the outlet. “The phone got disconnected.” Horror footage shows festival-goers in Israel shot at point blank range The moment Hamas troops descended on an Israel festival has been caught on dashcam, with a militant wearing a black cap and vest taking a man by the scruff of his shirt. Brandishing an automatic weapon, he first yells at the festivalgoer to get out of his hiding spot, before grabbing him and dragging him across a field. When they move out of the shot, a man who had been hiding from the terror pops his head up - with the footage recorded some three hours into the shock attack. An estimated 260 people were killed in the attach at the Tribe of Nova festival, popular with music lovers in their 20s and 30s. Even more are thought to have been kidnapped, namely women. Around 1,500 bodies of Hamas militants found in Israel Bodies of Hamas militants have been found in Israel around the Gaza Strip, the army said Tuesday, as it pummelled the Palestinian enclave with air strikes.“Approximately 1,500 bodies of Hamas (fighters) were found in Israel around the Gaza Strip,” military spokesman Richard Hecht said, adding that security forces had “more or less restored control over the border” with Gaza. Woman films Israeli air strike A young Palestinian woman living in the Gaza Strip has documented the reality of living close to Israeli air strikes. In a video on Instagram, posted on Tuesday morning, Plestia Alaqad said most of her neighbours had evacuated, except for her family and a few others. “The neighbours who didn’t evacuate as well (as me), they have their windows down … the family are gathering together in a place far away from the windows …” But Ms Alaqad’s video is suddenly interrupted as missiles from Israel fall close to her flat, the pressure wave causing her hair to jump. “I was trying to explain things but I think you can hear them now,” said a visibly shaken Ms Alaqad. She then said she had to check on her parents. “We’re inside the house right now and literally we can’t breath,” Ms Alaqad said, She then showed a view from her window with her neighbourhood covered in thick dust following the explosions. Another videolater showedthe young woman evacuating her building with other residents in the middle of the night. According to the United Nations, more than 187,500 people have been displaced by retaliatory Israeli air strikes, which have destroyed 790 housing units and severely damaged 5330, per the Associated Press. UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, is hosting more than 137,000 people in schools across the Gaza Strip. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Horror slur at Sydney pro-Palestine rally Footage has emerged of vile slogans chanted at apro-Palestine rally that took place outside the Sydney Opera Houseon Monday night. Around 1000 protesters gathered at Sydney Town Hall before marching through the streets of the city to the Opera House where the landmark was illuminated with the colours of the Israeli flag, a move intended to show solidarity with the nation. Among chants of “Allahu Akbar” (“God is great”), a more menacing call can be heard on a Twitter post uploaded by the Australian Jewish Association. A number of people in the crowd chanted “Gas the Jews” at the protest. In the Second World War, as many as six million Jews were gassed to death by the Nazi regime in Berlin. The chant, “F*** the Jews,” can also be heard. Police officers can be seen on the steps of the Opera House looking on at the marchers. It’s understood the protesters had not filled out the paperwork to allow them to march through the city, but police allowed the protest as it was thought safer to allow it to go ahead than try and ban it. However police are now scouring CCTV to identify protesters who burned Israeli flags and set off fireworks. Mum’s chilling final text An Israeli mother sent a final reassuring WhatsApp message to friends in Sydney shortly before she was slaughtered alongside her husband and three children by Hamas terrorists. “Hi guys, we got into the shelter in our house, we’re all going okay,” Tamar Kedem-Siman Tov, 35, texted Yishai and Mor. Lacob at about 2.45pm on Saturday from their home in the Nir Oz kibbutz in southern Israel, which had come under missile attack. An hour later, Tamarstopped respondingto texts,The Sydney Morning Heraldreports. Not long after, the Lacobs received word that the safe room had been breached by rampaging Hamas terrorists, who massacred the entire family — Tamar, her husband Yonatan, and their children Shachar, 6, Arbel, 6, and Omer, 4. “Our hearts are shattered,” Yishai wrote on Facebook. “An entire family was killed by evil murderers who shot the children and parents simply because they were Jewish. And this is just one story, among so many. It’s unbearable!” Tamar, a community activist and women’s rights activist, recently campaigned to become head of the Eshkol Regional Council – and only recently posted a family photo online captioned, “It should be a good year for all of us,” according to the outlet. “She was such a special woman. She always cared about the poor people, always made sure that people less fortunate will have the same opportunities. She was a living example to these values,” Mor. told the newspaper. Raz Asher, 4, and Aviv Asher, 2 The sisters and their mother Doron had been spending the last day of Sukkot with family in Kibbutz Nir Oz, in southern Israel, when news broke that the kibbutz had been the target on of one of the most savage attacks. Doron Asher Doron was hiding in a fortified safe room with her two daughters and mother after telling her husband Yoni over the phone that  ""terrorists are in the house"". The next he knows was from a video showing all four in the back of a metal cart, being taken by gunmen. Tracking data on Doron’s phone then showed she was in Khan Younis, a city ­inside Gaza. Debbie and Shlomi Mathias The couple were killed shielding their teenage son, Rotem, with their bodies when Hamas terrorists invaded their home. Their act of bravery saved the 16-year-old, who suffered a bullet wound to his abdomen but survived. Tamar Kedem-Siman Tov, her husband Yonatan and their children Shachar, 6, Arbel, 6, and Omer, 4 The entire family was killed after the bunker they were in was reportedly breached. Israel’s former prime minister Naftali Bennett wrote on X: ""Look at their happy faces. Their love. All of them murdered by Palestinian terrorists at Nir-Oz kibbutz. Just because they’re Jews."" Erez Kalderon, 10 The youngster was snatched from his home in Nir Oz with his fatherOfferand sisterSahar, 16. Itay and Hadar Berdichevsky The Israeli couple were killed in their home, but managed to save their 10-month-old twin babies by placing them in a hidden shelter. Israeli ambassador to Colombia Gali Dagan said: ""Itay and Hadar were brutally murdered after bravely fighting the terrorists. The babies were left alone for more than 12 hours until they were rescued."" Jack Marlowe, 26 The young Briton was working as a security guard at the Supernova music festival where 260 people were killed by invading Hamas militants, and hasn't contacted family. An Israeli embassy spokesman said: ""We don't know for sure that he is taken hostage or dead or in a hospital."" Shiri Bibas, son Ariel, four, and baby Kfir, nine months Having been seized in their Nir Oz home, Shiri Bibas was seen with her children in video as they were taken away by militants. Her husbandYardenand Shiri's fatherYosi, who needs daily medication for Parkinson's, and motherMargit, were also taken. Shani Louk, 22 The graphic designer and tattoo artist was initially reported killed after being abducted from a music festival when the militants struck. Her German mother said she recognised her daughter in videos circulating online of a half-naked woman lying face down in the back of a pick-up truck in Gaza with armed men seated around her and spitting on her. Ricarda Louk has since been told her daughter is alive but critically injured with a severe head injury. Yaffa Adar, 85 The grandmother was bundled into a golf buggy at gunpoint by a group of terrorists. Her granddaughter Adva said the family lost contact with her and later found her home had been burned down. Nathanel Young, 20 Young, from London, had been serving with the IDF when he was killed on the Gaza border. His brother, Eliot Young, said:  ""Nathanel was full of life and the life of the party. He loved his family and friends and was loved by everyone."" Noa Argamani, 25 Noa Argamani, 25, was at the Supernova music festival and was last seen being driven away on a motorcycle as another group of militants held her boyfriend,Avinatan Or, his arm pinned behind his back. She was screaming: ""Don't kill me! No, no, no"", her arms outstretched ­towards her boyfriend. Danny Darlington and Carolin Bohl The British photographer and his German friend died at Nir Oz, family members said. Carolin's family said they had ""reliable information from the ground"" that neither survived Hamas' attack on the kibbutz. Danny's sister Shelley Darlington said: ""My baby brother, Dan, was murdered by terrorists ... Our community has been destroyed."" Inbar Shem Tov, 22 Aharon Shem Tov received a video from his daughter as she hid from attackers in a dumpster with five others. At 8.45am she told him ""everything is OK"", but three hours later texted: ""We are going to die."" That was the last contact. ""Maybe the terrorists took her or she ran away, I don't know,"" Mr Tov said. Lior Asulin, 43 The former Israeli pro soccer player was killed while celebrating his birthday at the Supernova festival. Soccer team Hapoel Tel Aviv said: ""With great sadness, after many hours when he was declared missing, we have been informed that our former player Lior Asulin was murdered by terrorists at the party in Re'im."" Death toll rises to 1600 The total death toll now stands at nearly 1600. At least 900 people are confirmed dead in Israel — including more than 260 who were attending a music festival and more than 100 at a kibbutz near the Gaza border — and 73 soldiers, according to Israeli officials and media. In Gaza, the health ministry says 687 people are dead, including 140 children. Thousands have been injured on both sides. World leaders back Israel The leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy have issued a joint statement following a call to discuss the Israel situation. “We make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned,”the statementsaid. “There is never any justification for terrorism. In recent days, the world has watched in horror as Hamas terrorists massacred families in their homes, slaughtered over 200 young people enjoying a music festival, and kidnapped elderly women, children, and entire families, who are now being held as hostages. “Over the coming days, we will remain united and co-ordinated, together as allies, and as common friends of Israel, to ensure Israel is able to defend itself, and to ultimately set the conditions for a peaceful and integrated Middle East region.” Obama condemns ‘slaughter’ Former US PresidentBarack Obamahas weighed in to support Israel as it “dismantles” Hamas. “All Americans should be horrified and outraged by the brazen terrorist attacks on Israel and the slaughter of innocent civilians,” Mr Obama wrote on X. “We grieve for those who died, pray for the safe return of those who’ve been held hostage, and stand squarely alongside our ally, Israel, as it dismantles Hamas. As we support Israel’s right to defend itself against terror, we must keep striving for a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.” Murdered couple hid twin babies A young Israeli couple was murdered by Hamas terrorists who broke into their home — but not before the parents hid their 10-month-old twins, who were found alive about 14 hours later,theNY Postreports. Itai and Hadar Berdichevsky, both 30, were attacked in their home in Kfar Gaza, a kibbutz in southern Israel located about three miles east of Gaza, according toIsraeli outletWalla. The parents, who hid their babies in a bomb shelter, tried to fight off the terrorists but were murdered, the news outlet reported. Israeli troops rescued the unharmed babies about 14 hours later and handed them to their grandmother. Grandmother’s execution posted to FB An Israeli granddaughter says her heart was “shattered to pieces” after her grandmother was brutally murdered by a Hamas terrorist — who then used the elderly woman’s phone to snap photos of her butchered body and post them to her Facebook account. Mor Bayder witnessed the “nightmare of [her] life” after logging onto Facebook, where horrifying photos and video footage of her beloved grandmother being slaughtered inside her Nir Oz home were shared on her page,theNY Postreports. Ms Bayder’s family only learned of her grandmother’s death from the social media post, she wrote in a moving tribute to her grandmother. “A terrorist came home to her, killed her, took her phone, filmed the horror and published it on her Facebook wall. This is how we found out,” Ms Bayder said. “My grandmother my whole world the light of my life. The pillar of my life, in my family’s life.” ‘We have to go in’, Bibi tells Biden Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told US President Joe Biden on Sunday that Israel has no choice but to unleash a ground invasion of Gaza. “We have to go in. We can’t negotiate now,” he said, Israeli and US sources briefed on the calltold Axios. The PM reportedly raised the issue of Israeli hostages in Gaza during the call. He told Mr Biden Israel had no choice but to respond with force because a country can’t show weakness in the Middle East, according to Axios. “We need to restore deterrence,” he said. ‘Some headway’ in hostage talks Hamas is not open to negotiating a prisoner exchange with Israel during hostilities, a member of the militants’ political office in Doha said on Monday. Potential talks on the fate of as many as 150 individuals held by Hamas gained greater urgency as the group threatened to start executing its hostages if Israel carried out air strikes in the Gaza Strip without prior warning to residents. ‘A war to ensure our existence’: PM Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has addressed the nation in a televised speech, his first public appearance since Saturday night. “We are on the third day of the operation,” he said. “We are in an operation for our home, a war to ensure our existence, a war that we will win. This war was imposed upon us by a despicable enemy — by beasts who celebrate the murder of women, children, and the elderly. “The atrocities carried out by Hamas have not been seen since the atrocities of ISIS. Children bound and executed with the rest of their families, young girls and boys shot in the back, executed, and other atrocities that I will not describe here. “We have always known what Hamas is. Now the whole world knows. Hamas is ISIS. And we will defeat [Hamas] precisely as the enlightened world defeated ISIS.” Mr Netanyahu, who sits at the head of a hard-right coalition government, called on Israel’s opposition to form an emergency national unity government “without any preconditions”,The Times of Israelreports. The PM said the government planned to regain control of the territory and “eliminate terrorists” still present in Israel. Israel planned to carry out a “massive” assault against Hamas with “unprecedented force” and “strengthen other fronts in the north against Hezbollah” in Lebanon, as well as in the occupied West Bank, he said. Mum and two little girls among hostages An Israeli mother and her two young daughters were among the more than 100 civilians taken hostage by Hamas,theNY Postreports. Doron Asher had gone with her young girls to visit their grandmother in the village Nir Oz near the Gaza border over the weekend when Hamas militants descended on the home. Terrified, she called her husband, Yoni, back in central Israel, but the phone cut out, and he hasn’t heard from her since. “She told me the terrorists are in the house,” and that was it, Yoni said. Tracking Doron’s phone, her location showed her as being across the border in Gaza, Yoni said. His fears were later confirmed when he saw video on social media that clearly showed Doron and their daughters loaded at gunpoint into a cart along with other hostages and being taken away by Hamas militants. “I surely identified my wife, my two daughters and my mother-in-law on some kind of a cart and terrorists of Hamas all around them,” Yoni said. “My little two girls, they are only babies, they are not even five years old and three years old … I don’t know in what terms they are captive. I don’t know what happened to them.” Foreigners killed, missing or abducted Dozens of foreigners have been killed, injured or taken hostage during a surprise attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas Saturday that has left 800 people dead, mostly Israelis. Many of the missing foreigners were at an electronic music festival in the southern Israeli desert, at which scores of revellers were massacred. Here is what we know so far. Thailand:12 dead, 11 hostages — Twelve Thai labourers were killed, eight were wounded and 11 were taken captive, foreign ministry spokeswoman Kanchana Patarachoke said Monday. Labour Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said there were around 5000 Thai labourers working in the areas hit by fighting who were being moved to safety. Nepal:10 dead — Ten citizens of Nepal were killed in Kibbutz Alumim, one of the flashpoints of the Hamas assault, the Himalayan republic’s embassy in Tel Aviv said on Sunday. Four others were being treated in hospital while a search was underway for a fifth person, the embassy added. Kibbutz Alumim was hosting 17 students at the time of the attack. Argentina:7 dead, 15 missing — Argentina’s foreign ministry on Monday confirmed that seven of the country’s nationals were killed and 15 others were missing. US:11 dead, others missing — The United States on Monday confirmed the deaths of at least 11 US citizens and said it was “likely” that Americans were among the hostages being held by Hamas. Ukraine:2 dead — Two Ukrainian women who had been living in Israel for years were killed, Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said on Sunday. France:2 dead, 14 missing — Two French people have been killed in “Hamas’s terrorist attacks against Israel”, the French government said. A 12-year-old is among 14 of its nationals missing after Hamas launched deadly raids into Israel, the French foreign ministry said calling the situation “worrying”. “Based on the information we have, we consider it highly likely that some of them have been abducted”, the ministry said in a statement, adding that “this number is still subject to change”. Russia:1 dead, 4 missing — At least one Russian has been killed and four others are missing, the Russian embassy in Tel Aviv announced on Monday, quoted by the Russian news agencies. UK:1 dead, 1 missing — Israel’s ambassador to Britain said there was one 26-year-old British citizen missing, without naming the person. A British man who was serving in the Israeli army, Nathanel Young, 20, also died in fighting with Hamas, his family said on Sunday. Canada:1 dead, 3 missing — The Canadian government said Monday that one Canadian had died and three others were missing. Cambodia:1 dead — Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet said one Cambodian student was killed. Germany:several hostages — Several dual German-Israeli nationals were kidnapped, a German foreign ministry source said Sunday. The mother of 22-year-oldShani Louktold news outletDer Spiegelthat she recognised her daughter in videos circulating online of a half-naked woman lying face down in the back of a pick-up truck in Gaza with armed men seated around her. Ricarda Lock toldSpiegelthat her daughter had been at the music festival. Brazil:3 missing, one injured — Brazil’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that three dual Brazilian-Israeli nationals were missing after attending the festival and a fourth was being treated in hospital. Chile:2 missing — The Chilean foreign ministry confirmed Monday that two nationals are missing. The couple lived on a kibbutz not far from Israel’s border with Gaza. Italy:2 missing — Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said that two Israeli-Italians were missing. “They have not been located and are not answering calls,” he said.

Mexico:2 hostages — Mexico’s Foreign Minister Alicia Barcena wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that two Mexicans, one man and one woman, had been taken hostage, without giving further details. Colombia:2 hostages — Two Colombians who were at the Supernova festival are missing, Israel’s ambassador to Colombia said on X. The Colombian government confirmed that two Colombians were at the rave and said it was trying to help locate them. Panama:1 missing — Panama’s government said one of its nationals, Daryelis Denises Saez Batista, was missing. Ireland:1 missing — An Irish-Israeli woman has been confirmed missing by the Irish government. Hamas warns it will execute hostages Hamas has warned Israel that if it bombs civilian houses in Gaza without warning then the militants will execute Israeli hostages in return, according to Reuters. Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida said that every Israeli massacre or attack without prior warning on Palestinian homes will be met with the execution of an Israeli captive. “And we will be forced to broadcast this execution,” he said. “It is a final warning and it is a final ultimatum.” Response will ‘change the Middle East’ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Monday to “change the Middle East” in Israel’s war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, as the army pounded the Gaza Strip with air strikes. “What Hamas will experience will be difficult and terrible … we are going to change the Middle East,” Mr Netanyahu told officials in the country’s south where Hamas militants carried out a surprise attack on Saturday morning. “This is only the beginning … we are all with you and we will defeat them with force, enormous force.” — with AFP and NY Post Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza.

Australians issued warning over Hamas,https://www.news.com.au/national/australians-warned-against-supporting-hamas-terrorist-group/news-story/8cac988fee6c17b7c8de3af6f8e97cc3,"Australia has issued a clear warning that Hamas is a declared terrorist organisation and providing support to it is a crime as the Prime Minister condemned anti-Semitic protests in Sydney. Disturbing images have emerged from pro-Palestinian rallies in Sydney, including one TikTok account showing a man “interviewing” horse excrement to get the “pro-Israeli point of view”. Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil issued the urgent warning on Hamas today after some protesters offered support for the militant organisation. “I have spent today being briefed on the deplorable attacks on Israel by Hamas and the implications for Australia,’’ Ms O’Neil said. “Hamas is listed as a terrorist organisation in Australia and anyone providing support to Hamas could be committing a crime. “We condemn the attacks and stand with Jewish Australians in our heartbreak over the lost lives of innocent people.” The protests in support of Palestine took place after hundreds of Israelis were gunned down at a music festival by militants. Israeli women and children were also kidnapped from their homes and in some cases murdered. More than 800 Israelis and 500 Palestinians have died amid heavy fighting and bombardment in the wake of the largest attack by Hamas against Israel in decades. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button. A plan to light up the Opera House in blue and white in support of Israel sparked the large pro-Palestinian protest and police advice for Jewish families to stay away for their own safety. “Look, even I’ve now seen the images just recently and they’re horrific,’’ Mr Albanese told Sky News. “Quite clearly slogans which are anti Semitic and just appalling. I did say that that demonstration shouldn’t have gone ahead, and I stand by that.” Mr Albanese said he accepted that Palestinian families were also suffering. “We are a tolerant multicultural nation. I understand that people have deep views about issues relating to the Middle East conflict,’’ he said. “But here in Australia, we have to deal with political discourse in a respectful way. “And I certainly didn’t see that from the footage that I saw last night, which is one of the reasons why I believe it was just inappropriate for it to go ahead last night. “We certainly acknowledge, I acknowledge, Palestinian suffering has occurred over a long period of time. “Nothing justifies what we saw on the weekend. Nothing justifies the slaughter of innocent civilians trying to enjoy a music festival.” Jewish groups have condemned the protests as difficult to comprehend. “It is hard to believe that an icon of Sydney was defiled in such a way with videos of protesters chanting “F*** the Jews”, burning Israeli flags and lighting and throwing flares. We are also aware of other incidents and are responding appropriately,” NSW JBD president David Ossip said. Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Alex Ryvchin said worshippers of death, rape and misery had no place in civilised society. “We have all seen the horrific images and videos. Women stripped naked and paraded. Infant children taken from their parents, taunted and tormented by Palestinian kids. Bodies dragged and desecrated,’’ he said. Mr Albanese declined to be drawn on whether there were any Australians that remain unaccounted for. “We are working with DFAT consistently. There’s nothing I can add publicly at this time,’’ he said. “But we’re working with families, people who have relatives and others in the region."" Mr Albanese urged the community to engage in respectful dialogue. “We need to lower the temperature. I don’t want to see conflict here in Australia, and I don’t want to see the sort of scenes that I saw last night,’’ he said.

Scary sign ‘bloodiest’ war has ‘barely started’,https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/satellite-map-exposes-israels-terrifying-task-as-hamas-attacks/news-story/0ad08e42a3aa8777b713267db21cfa14,"Israel is in a precarious position. It’s been grappling with Arab Palestinians over ownership of the Holy Land for decades. Its neighbours Syria and Lebanon are wracked with internal turmoil. Jordan and Egypt still harbour resentment over its very existence. The remnants of the jihadist Islamic State are still seeding chaos throughout the region. And Russia and the United States are engaged in an escalating power struggle. And the weekendsurprise attack by Hamas militantsthreatens once again to immolate the troubled region in conflict. “Citizens of Israel, we are at war,” embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in a televised statement to his people at the weekend. “Not an operation, not a round of fighting – at war!” The subject of his declaration was the democratically elected Palestinian government, the Hamas movement. This group’s militant wing has been receiving arms and training from Iran. And that fact has prompted Israel in recent years to repeatedly strike facilities in Syria and Lebanon, which it claimed were part of this process. At the weekend, Hamas revealed the full extent of its preparations. “Although much of the Western media did not notice, the leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Qods Force, General Esmail Qaani, had been meeting with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad leaders in the region to co-ordinate and thus more effectively threaten and provoke Israel,” saysCouncil on Foreign Relations analyst Steven Cook. “Operation Al Aqsa Flood may be the result.” A co-ordinated attack from land, sea and air was unleashed upon Israel and the occupied territories. It involved drones, paragliders, rockets, mortars and heavy arms. All must have been smuggled into Gaza from Egypt’s Sinai desert region and Lebanon via underground tunnels and blockade runners. Israel’s severely embarrassed Netanyahu governmentwill likely feel compelled to retaliate. But Iran is a long distance away. And any attempt to find and destroy Hamas supply and training facilities in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria risks further escalation. Operation Al Aqsa Flood “The first question is over Israel’s response, which Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed will follow soon,” arguesChatham House Chief Executive Bronwen Maddox. “He has portrayed himself as ‘Mr Security’, and this attack represents a real humiliation.” The Hamas assault appears to have had little tactical purpose beyond inflicting death and destruction upon Israeli settlements, citizens and armed forces. “Under these circumstances, no foreign government, including the United States, will have any leverage on Israel to respond with restraint,” notes Cook. “So far, the IDF has not issued a general call-up, but significant numbers of units have been mobilised. The Israelis do not want to occupy the Gaza Strip, but the withdrawal from the area in 2005 can only now be regarded as a major mistake.” University of Sydney Conflict Studies lecturer Eyal Mayrozsays that, while Hamas’ motivations are uncertain, Israel’s reaction is not. “The assured severity of Israel’s retaliation against the group – and, as a consequence, the civilian population in Gaza – makes it likely that considerations beyond just tit-for-tat revenge were at play,” he writes. “Arguably, this weekend’s national trauma and the radical make-up of Netanyahu’s right-wing government will make it very difficult for him to show similar restraint in the coming days.” A clash of Iron Swords The United States has redirected its newest aircraft carrier, the USS Ford, and its battlegroup to the Eastern Mediterranean. It’s also moved to strengthen the number of combat aircraft across the Middle East. But, unlike the October 6, 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel is unlikely to face an open assault from Syria or Egypt. Syria is in turmoil. A brutal civil war against the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad erupted in 2011. The resulting fragmentation along ethnic and religious grounds helped pave the way for the rise of Islamic State. It enabled Iran to expand its covert support for Palestinian fighters. The militaries of Russia, the United States and Turkey now occupy parts of the fractured state. And Israel regularly launches air strikes deep inside its territory. Egypt has its own internal problems. The authoritarian government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power after widespread clashes and demonstrations in 2013. It has since been accused of detaining and torturing political activists and dissidents by the thousands. And Israel has built a five metre-high fence along the border to block refugee and smuggler movements. Lebanon is a failed state. Years of Israeli occupation and internal factional disputes have left its 5.6 million people virtually ungoverned. As such, it has become a significant base of operations for the militant Hezbollah group. Jordan, however, signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. This ended the state of perpetual war between the two countries that had existed since 1948. Relations have steadily improved, with King Abdullah engaging in bilateral discussions. But, in April this year, Jordanian MP Imad Al-Adwan was arrested by Israel during an attempt to smuggle weapons into the Palestinian West Bank. Behind much of the Middle East’s turmoil, however, is Iran. It’s been blamed for building the networks supplying Palestinian groups with arms, training and intelligence support. “While Tehran has said it supports the attacks by Hamas against Israel, it remains uncertain at this point whether Iran or Hezbollah would open additional fronts against Israel in the coming days,” says Mayroz. “Any escalation in the conflict from either Iran or Lebanon would be highly problematic for Israel. The same would apply if the war with Hamas further exacerbates the already high tensions and violent clashes between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the West Bank.” Internal victory “For the moment, Israel will unite behind Netanyahu,” saysChatham House’s Maddox. “Voices protesting his recent moves to weaken the Supreme Court will now be quiet. But there is a strong case that his deeply divisive moves, which led to an unprecedented period of protests within Israel, distracted the government and divided military forces and reservists.” Netanyahu has also promised to expand Israeli settlements within the occupied West Bank. “Some (in his government) have declared all the land from the sea to the Jordan River as Israeli,” Maddox adds. It’s a highly provocative stance. It’s a move that would once again mobilise international outrage. But, now, military occupation may be one course for Netanyahu to restore his reputation. “Along with the need to restore the trust of the Israeli public and resurrect Israel’s smashed military deterrence against Hamas and other foes, Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government will likely have to deal with other complexities,” warns Mayroz. This includes the fate of hostages, urban combat against a hostile population, and the threat of violence within Israel’s own mixed Jewish-Arab cities. “The current round of violence has barely started, but it could end up being the bloodiest in decades – perhaps since the war between Israel and the Palestinians in Lebanon during the 1980s,” he adds. Netanyahu government talks to “normalise” relationships with Saudi Arabia have stalled. This diplomatic dance has been taking place for months. If successful, it would have represented a decrease in tensions between regional powers and a source of expanded economic reach for both nations. But its future is now in doubt. “The argument is that Iran, a longtime backer of Hamas (and Hezbollah), would not like to see its great rival Saudi Arabia strengthened by a deal with Israel,” says Maddox. And such a move would also “from the US point of view, counter China’s influence in the region”. Foreign Minister Penny Wong will travel to Israel in the coming weeks as Australia urges leaders to chart an end to the war in Gaza. Dozens of Hamas terrorists have reportedly surrendered to Israeli forces in northern Gaza, with extraordinary photos showing the men stripped to their underwear.

More pro-Palestine rallies planned nationally,https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/propalestine-protests-planned-for-melbourne-following-ugly-scenes-in-sydney/news-story/b064cea28dce9195f2764ad854b4f6d1,"A snap rally in support of Palestine has been held in Melbourne following tense scenes in Sydney, where flares were lit, and anti-Semitic slogans were chanted. The rallies follow Israel’s retaliation against Islamic militants from Palestine’s ruling political faction Hamas, that launched a devastating surprise attack on their longstanding foes at the weekend. Group Free Palestine Melbourne organised Tuesday evening’s snap protest on the steps of the Victorian State Library. Hundreds of attendees gathered, chanting slogans like “Palestine will be free / from the river to the sea.” Others brandished placards and banners with pro-Palestinian messages, one reading: “FREE PALESTINE BOYCOTT ISRAEL.” Members of the crows also waved Aboriginal flags, with a man named Kieran, who performed the event’s welcome to country, telling the crowd there were parallels to be drawn between the treatment of Indigenous Australians and the people of Palestine. “In our solidarity, we strive for nothing less than the complete dismantling of the oppressive structures that perpetuate insidious ideologies,” Kieran said. Palestinian university student Dana addressed the rally, taking aim at media reports branding Hamas a terrorist organisation, saying her people had been pushed to a breaking point following decades of Israeli oppression. “For the past 75 years, we have been killed. We have been brutalised. We have been slaughtered,” she told the crowd. “We have been ethnically cleansed, dispossessed and displaced, homes stolen, entire families wiped off the face of the earth, imprisoned, and dehumanised by the world. “Palestinians have the right to protect themselves by any means necessary.” About an hour into the event the group began moving through CBD streets, and started dissipating about 9pm. Despite the numbers rivalling those in the Sydney protest, there seemed to be no sign of anti-Semitism or troublemakers among the crowd, with a large police force present. Hundreds of pro-Palestine demonstrators marched from Sydney Town Hall to the Opera House on Monday night. Attendees were criticised for some anti-Jewish chanting that broke out among a small group, while one man brandishing an Israeli flag was arrested, NSW Police saying it was for his own protection.

More pro-Palestinian action is planned in Perth, Brisbane, and Canberra on Friday evening, and Adelaide will join repeat events in Sydney and Melbourne on Sunday. A Victoria Police spokesperson said the force would “have a highly visible presence” to prevent breaches of the peace and ensure the safety of the community. “While individuals have the right to protest lawfully, we strongly encourage those attending to protest peacefully and without impacting the broader community,” the spokesperson said. “Victoria Police retains close communications with all communities which have a strong interest in events unfolding in the Middle East.” The death toll from what’s being called the Israel-Hamas War is believed to have exceeded 1500.

‘One fight’: NRL star’s call on Palestine,https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/josh-addocarr-announces-support-for-palestine-amid-conflict/news-story/9a784fdf75fafce20d0a65061498ad2e,"NRL legend Josh Addo-Carr has voiced his support for Palestine amid a major escalation of conflict between Israel and Hamas. The footy star took to social media to voice his support, connecting it with Indigenous issues in Australia. “One struggle, one fight,” he shared on Instagram. Horrific conflict broke out on Saturday after militant group Hamas fired more than 3500 rockets into Israel in an unprecedented surprise attack. Armed militants also stormed towns, killing and capturing civilians. Israel has responded with force, hitting more than 500 targets on the Gaza Strip in retaliatory strikes. NCA NewsWire does not suggest that Addo-Carr’s post was in support of Hamas’ attack on Israel. Mr Addo-Carr is not the only football player to wade into the debate over the conflict, with Sonny Bill Williams sparking criticism over a retweet on Sunday evening. “So, Ukrainian civilians defending their families are ‘freedom fighters’...But Palestinians in Gaza doing the EXACT same thing are ‘terrorists’?” the tweet he liked and shared said. “PRAYING FOR GAZA!!” Mr Williams said in a separate tweet. The tweet drew the ire of talkback radio host Ray Hadley, who called for the NRL legend to be sacked by Channel 9 over his stance. “Now, Sonny Bill Williams has re-tweeted something from some other lunatic, and he says, so Ukrainian civilians defending their families are freedom fighters, but Palestinians in Gaza doing the exact same thing are terrorists,” Hadley said on 2GB on Tuesday morning. “As I’ve said, if brains were dynamite, Sonny Bill Williams wouldn’t blow his ears off. “It’s embarrassing for me and other people connected with this radio and TV network that he’s employed by - and I think that the CEO of the company should review his employment prospects.” Israel is now “at war” after the surprise attack from Hamas militants, with hundreds of its civilians now confirmed dead and hostages have been taken. It has also announced a total blockade of Gaza, cutting off food, electricity and fuel supplies as a part of a “complete siege”. The conflict has reverberated around the world, with services for mourners and fiery anti-Israel protests taking place in capital cities in Australia. Around 1000 protesters gathered at Sydney’s Town Hall for a Free Palestine rally on Monday evening, before walking to the Sydney Opera House, which had been lit up in blue and white in solidarity with Israel. Melbourne will see its own Free Palestine Rally on Tuesday with at least 500 people planning to attend a “snap action” protest at the State Library. Police became aware of the planned protest in Sydney on Monday and had decided to allow it to take place according to NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Tony Cooke. “(We were able) to prevent the risk of conflict, to prevent the risk of offences, disturbances to the public right throughout the city,” Mr Cooke said. “This is clearly a very emotive issue across communities … (and) we do not expect people to bring conflict from other places to the streets of Sydney.” While the protest was underway, a man who was spotted waving the Israeli flag was arrested by police in what Mr Cooke said was an attempt to keep the peace. The man has since been identified as father of two Mark Spiro, who told Sky News he felt the officers’ actions were “excessive”. On Tuesday, Mr Cooke clarified that Mr Spiro had been removed from the protest as his presence “could have caused significant risk to him and others”. “I understand his view … (but) it was necessary,” he said. “In the circumstances the best option for us was to take the actions we did.” More to come.

The Palestinian militant group, which rules the Gaza Strip, launched an extensive air, sea and land attack on the country on Saturday, coinciding with the Jewish holiday Simchat Torah. Government officials have since confirmed more than 100 people, including a Holocaust survivor, have been taken hostage, with those held captive believed to have been moved to Gaza. In a post on social media, non-profit organisation Israel War Room claimed “mostly women” appear to have been kidnapped by the group at present time. The group also repeated unverified claims that some hostages have been raped by Hamas militants. “It has already been confirmed that Hamas fighters are using rape as a weapon of war,” it said. “There must be no mercy for these barbarians.” Dr Melanie O’Brien, a Visiting Professor at the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, University of Minnesota, said war, such as the one raging in Israel, bears a “unique” toll on women and girls, who are historically targets of kidnapping and sexual violence. “Conflict is highly gendered. Men are impacted by conflict often in a way that involves torture and as combatants [where] they receive injuries and can be killed,” she told news.com.au. “Women are often not combatives [and] they’re not carrying weapons. They are at risk during conflict where civilians are not protected by the parties to the conflict so it makes it easy to take women.” Dr O’Brien added sexual violence was “one of the biggest things that differentiates the experience of men and women” during war. “It’s not to say that no boys or men experience sexual violence, but the sheer numbers of sexual violence and the commonality of it against girls and women is a whole other level,” she explained. “There has been a lot of reports of sexual violence against girls and women in Ukraine by Russians, which has significant and ongoing effects including mental health and pregnancies.” Reports of sexual violence ‘inevitable’ in Israel There are yet to be any reports of rape by official sources in Israel, however, one survivor reported women were sexually assaulted after Hamas militants descended on aSupernova music festivalin the country's south on Saturday. “Women have been raped at the area of the rave next to their friends bodies, dead bodies,” they told US publicationTablet. The publication reported several of the rape victims were later executed, while others were taken to Gaza. As the conflict continues, Dr O’Brien said reports of abuse in Israel, as in other international conflicts, was “inevitable”. “In atrocities everywhere, and especially when women are taken into detention, there is an extremely high risk of sexual violence against girls and women. I would not be surprised if reports of that come out later.” She added the footage of a German-Israeli woman Shani Louk being paraded in the back of a truck naked, already “indicates a possibility of sexual violence”.

Sexual violence used as a weapon of war Dr O’Brien said the prevalence of sexual violence in times of conflict came down to power and the desire to dominate the opposing side. “It is used to demonstrate to the men on the opposing side that they’re more powerful. They’re saying, ‘you can’t look after your girls and women, you can’t protect them’. “It often happens in front of family members, as well. And it’s often quite public and very brutal, so it echoes that idea of power and masculinity.” “We’ve also seen in past and current conflicts that women have been taken into sexual slavery, and forced marriages.” Pointing to other cases, she said “in former Yugoslavia, there were rape camps where women were taken to and kept”. As the conflict continues, Dr O’Brien said there was hope the International Criminal Courts, who hold jurisdiction over Palestine, could step in on matters of rape if there was no action taken on a domestic level. “The International Criminal Courts have laws prohibiting sexual violence in armed conflict. “If it does take place, the ICC already has its radar up and they’ll be paying attention the same way that they’re paying attention in Ukraine, hopefully.” Kidnapped from home In the wake of Hamas’ attack, dozens of distraught Israeli families have scrambled for information on missing loved ones. “I just want to be able to hug him,” said Omri Shtivi, 30, whose brother Idan went missing after a desert rave near the Gaza border came under attack by Hamas militants. Speaking to AFP by telephone, Shtivi said the authorities had not contacted the family to provide information or offer help in finding his brother. Police and the army’s Home Front Command opened late Saturday – about 16 hours after fighting began – a “command centre for missing persons” near Ben Gurion International Airport close to Lod in central Israel. Israeli man Yoni Asher toldTodayhis wife, two young daughters and mother-in-law had been taken hostage, after they visited their grandmother in the village Nir Oz near the Gaza border over the weekend. He said he had a phone call with his wife, Doron Asher, before they were taken. “She told me that there are terrorists inside the house, but when I saw the video later after I track(ed) her phone, there was no doubt in my mind that she was taken, they were taken, with my daughters, into Gaza by Hamas,” he toldToday. A series of videos on social media also show Hamas fighters capturing Israeli hostages at the Supernova music festival. In one harrowing video, Israeli student Noa Argamani, 25, was filmed as she was abducted from southern Israel. She screamed “don’t kill me” and stretched her arms out towards her boyfriend Avi Natan as she was carried away. Later footage showed her drinking from a water bottle in Gaza. Hamas threatens to execute hostages Hamas threatened on Monday to kill hostages if Israeli air strikes continue “targeting” Gaza residents without warning. The threat came after Israel imposed a total siege on the Gaza Strip, cutting off the water supply which sparked UN fears of an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. The militant group claimed Israeli air strikes had killed four of the hostages. “Every targeting of our people without warning will be met with the execution of one of the civilian hostages,” the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said in a statement. In a televised speech on Monday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared Hamas to the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, and said Israel planned to carry out a “massive” assault against Hamas with “unprecedented force”. “Hamas terrorists bound, burned and executed children. They are savages. Hamas is ISIS,” Mr Netanyahu said. He also vowed to “strengthen other fronts in the north against Hezbollah”, as well as in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. – with AFP If you or someone you know is experiencing sexual abuse or family violence contact:   Don't go it alone.
