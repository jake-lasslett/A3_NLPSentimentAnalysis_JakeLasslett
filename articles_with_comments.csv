"Mavi Marmara, group behind 2010 Gaza flotilla clash, plans to launch new ship into Gaza",https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-773443,"The Turkey-based Mavi Marmara organization, which infamously participated in the “Gaza Freedom Flotilla” of ships into waters off of the coastal enclave in 2010 and fought with IDF naval forces, announced on Wednesday new plans to launch another flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza.“We are setting out again towards Gaza as a civil and independent movement, in line with the decision we made with the International Freedom Flotilla, of which we are a member,” the organization announced in a statement.Members of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition have held meetings in London to plan the next flotilla from Europe to Gaza, which is set to sail next year in an attempt to break the naval blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip.“Our goals remain full human rights for all Palestinians,” the group wrote on its official website about its next flotilla: “In particular, freedom of movement within historic Palestine and the right of return.""Mavi Marmaraoperated one of the 37 ships that were part of the 2010 flotilla – a passenger ship carrying over 600 passengers. IDF forces boarded the ship after it refused to reroute to the Port of Ashdod and were met with violent resistance by the passengers.English-language flyer declaring Mavi Marmara's intention to participate in the next Gaza Freedom Flotilla.

Support the purchase of ships for the fleet and the supply of humanitarian aid materials, and raise your voice against the blockade and embargo,” the statement said.“Now is the time to end the blockade and embargo,” the flyer made by Mavi Marmara declares.Advertisement2010 Gaza Flotilla disasterThe original Gaza Freedom Flotilla arrived in Israeli waters in May 2010. After multiple warnings, IDF naval forces intercepted six groups of ships that were on their way to Gaza. The flotilla was sponsored by the Free Gaza Movement (FGM), several European Palestinian solidarity organizations, and Insani Yardim Vakfi (IHH), an Istanbul-based Islamic charity fund that has ties to Hamas.Members on board one of the largest ships in the flotillas –theMavi Marmarathat disembarked from Turkey– attacked the IDF with weapons. Israeli commandos descended on ropes from helicopters onto the ship and were immediately attacked with clubs, knives, and metal rods. Three soldiers were taken captive. Israeli troops opened fire after a protester, later identified as Ken O’Keefe, a former US marine, seized a gun from one of them.As a result of the clash on theMavi Marmara, ten flotilla members were killed and dozens were wounded. Ten Israeli soldiers were also wounded during the attack. The other five flotilla ships did not engage in fighting with the IDF, instead sailing to the Port of Ashdod and returning to their home countries.Anna Ahronheim contributed to this report. “We are setting out again towards Gaza as a civil and independent movement, in line with the decision we made with the International Freedom Flotilla, of which we are a member,” the organization announced in a statement.Members of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition have held meetings in London to plan the next flotilla from Europe to Gaza, which is set to sail next year in an attempt to break the naval blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip.“Our goals remain full human rights for all Palestinians,” the group wrote on its official website about its next flotilla: “In particular, freedom of movement within historic Palestine and the right of return.""Mavi Marmaraoperated one of the 37 ships that were part of the 2010 flotilla – a passenger ship carrying over 600 passengers.

"IDF slows down operation in Gaza, raising questions about military focus - comment",https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-773014,"The recent decline in the intensity of the IDF operation againstHamas in the Gaza Striphas raised questions about the IDF's commitment. The notable decrease in airstrikes and artillery fire, indicated by fewer explosions, suggests a reduction in offensive actions.Instead,IDF soldiersare focusing on clearing the areas under their control and dismantling military infrastructure, although their activities are limited. This is especially true in the Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City. Security sources have revealed that any decision to expand the IDF's ground operation in Gaza, or to shift focus toHezbollah in Lebanon, requires approval from higher political authorities.IDF refuted claims of wider offensive against HezbollahThe office of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has neither confirmed nor denied support for an escalated attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon. They have stated that their actions are in line with the cabinet's decisions, underscoring the ongoing operations in Gaza. In contrast, the IDF has refuted claims of advocating for a wider offensive against Hezbollah.(credit: INGIMAGE)Senior officials have emphasized that their current primary focus is on the Gaza Strip. However, they also recognize the importance of securing the region to facilitate the safe return of residents to settlements near the Lebanese border and nearby areas.The IDF's apparent lack of momentum in achieving its war objectives in Gaza has created a sense of uncertainty. This situation could potentially put their forces at risk, as a large, static military presence is more vulnerable to attacks by terrorist groups. This underscores the importance of a decisive and proactive military strategy.The Jerusalem Post and OneFamily are working together to help support the victims of the Hamas massacre and the soldiers of Israel who have been drafted to ensure that it never happens again.Become a partner in this project by donating to OneFamily>> Instead,IDF soldiersare focusing on clearing the areas under their control and dismantling military infrastructure, although their activities are limited.

"Jewish, Arab Israelis distribute packages to families displaced by Hamas",https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/article-773012,"From the harrowing tales of hostages in Gaza to the profound distress observed following theOctober 7 massacre, social media has been flooded with stories that stir a wide spectrum of emotions. Amid this despair, a ray of hope emerged over the weekend through a video that celebrated the ideals of bravery, conscience, humanity, and generosity.This video spotlighted Aya Midan, a Kibbutz Be'eri resident,whose life was savedby the courageous Alkarinawi family from Rahrat, a predominantly Arab Bedouin city in the Southern District. They risked their lives to rescue dozens of others. Produced by ""Have You Seen the Horizon Lately,"" an organization championing Jewish-Arab partnership, the video amassed over 2.5 million views, and conveyed the message, ""We are coming to take you; you are not alone.""Conversations in Hebrew and ArabicThis video's impact led to a surge in volunteering and support, culminating in unprecedented participation at the joint Jewish community center inRahat. Every Wednesday, the center becomes a hive of activity where hundreds of Jewish andBedouinIsraelis, especially women, gather to pack boxes with food, toys, and hygiene products. The environment thrives on a bilingual buzz, with conversations in both Hebrew and Arabic.Half of the assembled aid packages are allocated to Jewish families in nearby towns, and the other half to Bedouin families in Rahat and adjacent Negev villages.מתוך הטבח הנורא עלו סיפורי גבורה יוצאי דופן - צפו בסיפור המדהים מה-7 לאוקטובר שנחשף היוםpic.twitter.com/VbaqM6E409— האם ראית את האופק לאחרונה?

This figure includes four family members from Rahat.Rahat Mayor Ata Abu Madiam voiced the community's collective anguish and stressed the critical need for bridging differences in these trying times.""Many were unaware of Hamas's true nature""Talal Alkarinawi, a social activist from Rahrat and related to the heroes in Midan's rescue video, views the events of October 7 as a pivotal moment for the Bedouin community. He pointed out a critical misconception that existed among some people who mistakenly believed that Hamas was a legitimate entity fighting for land rights and the freedom of prisoners.Alkarinawi emphasized that many were unaware of Hamas's true nature, which he compares to ISIS, known for its indiscriminate violence and brutality against all, including Arabs. This realization brought to light the importance of understanding and distinguishing between legitimate political activism and violent extremism.(credit: official site)Alkarinawi is of the opinion that initiatives like this are instrumental in rebuilding trust and displaying the Bedouin community's commitment to peaceful coexistence. He sees these efforts as a testament to their ability to live in harmony alongside Jewish neighbors.

Hamas planned to push October 7 massacre to the West Bank border - report,https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/gaza-news/article-772934,"Hamas's original plan forOctober 7went beyond just a massacre in the Gaza border area and taking hundreds of hostages, but to continue their assault up to the border with the West Bank,The Washington Postreported Sunday, citing Western and Middle Eastern security officials briefed on collected evidence.This information was obtained from numerous maps, notes, supplies, and other written instructions found among the bodies of dead Hamas terrorists in the Gaza border area, as well as from interrogations of Hamas captives.""We know from interrogations that Hamas came in with detailed plans of their attack, including which commander should rape which soldiers in different places,"" Defense Minister Yoav Gallant explained toThe Washington Post,though the quote has since been removed from the original report.Hamas planned to go much farther into Israel on October 7On October 7, Hamas terrorists executed a meticulously planned mass infiltration of Israel, under the cover of a heavy rocket bombardment. There, they managed to wreak havoc on at least 22 Israeli towns and military outposts near the Gaza border throughout the day, killing around 1,200 Israelis and abducting hundreds of people to bring back to Gaza as hostages.The farthest the Hamas terrorists were able to infiltrate was the city of Ofakim in the Western Negev, around halfway between Gaza and the West Bank.Children's toys and personal items lie on the bloodstained floor of a child's bedroom, following a deadly infiltration by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip, in Kibbutz Beeri in southern Israel October 17, 2023. (credit: RONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS)However, according to theWashington Postarticle, the evidence suggests they were planning on going much farther, hitting major cities and military bases, and could have ended up making it to the West Bank, where Hamas has allies in the form of many local armed Palestinian terrorist cells.""If that had occurred, it would have been a huge propaganda win — a symbolic blow not only against Israel but also against the Palestinian Authority,"" a former US security official toldThe Washington Postunder the condition of anonymity.AdvertisementThis also comes as Israel's attention shifted away from Gaza and Hamas – particularly after the last round of fighting in 2021,Operation Guardians of the Wall– towards the West Bank, which had been seeing a dramatic upsurge in violence and terrorism.This, however, may have allowed Hamas to discreetly and methodically plot its plan over time, training terrorists and gathering intelligence in the utmost secrecy.""They were conning Israel on a strategic level, using handheld radios, land-wire networks in the tunnels and other comms that we couldn’t listen to, while using codes on the so-called open networks, which they knew we were listening to,"" former Israeli National Security Council deputy head Eran Etzion said, according toThe Washington Post. ""They were creating an alternative reality.""The report further said that this would have come at a high cost, with Hamas knowing the level of Israel's response.""They were very clear-eyed as to what would happen to Gaza on the day after,"" a senior Israeli military official told the outlet. ""They wanted to buy their place in history — a place in the history of jihad — at the expense of the lives of many people in Gaza.""However, while Hamas may have expected this level of Israeli response,the involvement of the USmay have come as a surprise.""An Israeli response? Yes, we expected that,"" senior Hamas political leadership member Ali Barakeh told The Financial Times in late October. ""But what we're seeing now is the entrance of the US into the battle, and this we didn't count on.""Washington diverted many of its forces to the area amid Israel's launching of Operation Swords of Iron, the latest war with Hamas.Just a day after Hamas's massacre, the US sent a carrier strike group, featuring the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, closer to Israel. Later in the month, the US sent Lt.-Gen. James Glynn, a three-star Marine general, and other military officers helped Israel plan its ground offensive into the Gaza Strip.At the time of writing, Israeli troops have managed to make heavy gains in the northern Gaza Strip, claiming that Hamas has lost control of the area and has encircled Gaza City.Efforts to free the remaining hostages and eliminate Hamas remain ongoing.

Israeli leaders don't have the authority to let anyone in Hamas live - opinion,https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-772536,"Pressures on Israel from Washington and other Western capitals are mounting to curtail the campaign todestroy Hamas, because of the humanitarian toll in Gaza.Israeli government leaders must resist these pressures with all their might. They must persist in pounding Hamas-ISIS to smithereens until every last Hamas commander is dead, every lastHamas terror attack tunnelis destroyed, and every last Hamas missile bunker is obliterated.That is the only justification for the tenure of this government; that is its promise to Israeli society. That is the only way Israel can restore basic security to a battered and traumatized public, the only way Israelis will return to their homes in the Negev and the Galilee.It is the only way Israel can restore some of its deterrent posture and survive in the predatory Middle East. It is the only way Israel stands a chance of pushing back against radical Islam’s attempt to strangulate Israel and achieve regional hegemony.The war cannot and must not end until Israel has achieved its legitimate military objectives in full, with no fudging, no obfuscations, and no hesitations. Israel cannot tolerate ceasefires along the way – no truces, no armistices, no fall backs, no restrictions on its use of (overwhelming and simultaneously precise) force – until total victory is achieved.Smoke and flames rise during Israeli strikes, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, in Gaza City, November 9, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/DOAA ROUQA)Complete capitulation orannihilation of Hamasis the goal, nothing less. No more Hamas in Gaza, or in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank). No more Hamas terrorists alive elsewhere in the world either. They all must be hunted down and eliminated.Everyone in Hamas must be hunted down and eliminatedIn the history of modern warfare, there is no more justified military campaign than this one. And only such a campaign to absolutely end the Hamas threat to Israel justifies the heavy losses that Israel already has suffered and the pain of what almost certainly will be further losses.AdvertisementIsraeli leaders have no mandate from the Israeli public to call off or scale back the assault on Hamas. Should they do so, under pressure from well-meaning and fickle allies alike, Israelis will explode in anger, assuredly filling the streets of every city in this country with millions of protesters demanding that the war against Hamas be fully prosecuted. Compromise with Hamas would be defeat. Bending to US President Biden (who, it must be acknowledged, thus far has been rock solid in his backing of Israel) would be considered collapse.OVER THE past 10 days, Israel has buried more than 30 brave warriors – fine and fearless young men pressed into military service to defend their country, many of them with tender wives and beautiful, little, now-orphaned children.One of them was my beloved young friend Yonadav Levenstein, may the Heavens avenge his death. Yonadav was a physical giant (known as the “Viking” of the Givati brigade’s elite reconnaissance unit) and a singer-scholar of a soul. He fought heroically in Nahal Oz on October 7-8, and then in Jabalya and Shati in Gaza before being felled by Palestinian barbarians who popped out of a terrorist attack tunnel.Just two months ago, I danced with him at his wedding to the delicate Hadar Karavani, singing together about happiness and joy in the streets of Jerusalem.Yonadav was the youngest son of my closest friends, Leora and Dr. Michael (Mordechai) Levenstein of Ma’aleh Adumim, who, like me, made aliyah from Canada many decades ago. Tragically, Michael died of cancer three years ago.Michael’s last request, pressed on me the night before he passed away, was to assist Yonadav in his wish to serve in a frontline IDF combat unit. Michael knew that Yonadav’s deepest desire – and, in retrospect, I guess his ultimate task in life – was to fight for the freedom and safety of the Jewish People in the Land of Israel.YONADAV’S ELDEST brother, Elnatan, a prominent lawyer and rising community figure, is a fighter for the Jewish People too, having served in an elite, secret commando unit on Israel’s southern border, and this month in an elite reserve unit on the northern border. I see Elnatan and his cohort as the next generation of Israel’s leaders, a new generation of principled and wise leaders whom this country desperately needs.Elnatan was laying in ambush against Hezbollah when he was called offline to travel home for Yonadav’s funeral on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Standing over the fresh gravesite of his youngest brother, Elnatan gave majestic voice to the defiant demand that the Israeli government stand firm in pursuing the war goals without flinching. This is what he said:“Yonadav, you were intimately familiar with our people’s history. You loved this country with all your heart. You built yourself up and fought to be accepted as a warrior in the Givati reconnaissance unit, where you excelled.“Alas, now you too are part of our history; part of a bloody war that is a historical turning point. A tough but necessary war. A war for the future of our people in our land. A war that should have been over a long time ago, a war that your generation should not have had to fight.“In Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, I and my army unit, along with the entire IDF, were trained and ready to complete the task. We had detailed battle plans and received clear instructions – only to have these plans and orders canceled repeatedly at the last moment. And over the years since then, there were other opportunities (to crush the enemy) that were not taken.“And now, you, little Yonadav, the baby of our family, were forced to fight this fight on behalf of us all.“This war must be Israel’s last war! Otherwise, the price is too high. Yonadav, you and your comrades-in-arms did not die in battle so that others will have to die in yet another war in two or five years’ time. The price that Israeli society has paid since that evil, horrible day of massacres on October 7, Simchat Torah 5784, is intolerable. No more!“Therefore, I call from here upon the prime minister, the minister of defense, other government ministers and decision-makers: Don’t you dare stop! Don’t you dare hesitate! Don’t you dare fold!“Don’t you dare allow even one drop of fuel into accursed Gaza until the rats, the evil terrorists of Hamas-ISIS, those who murder Jewish babies and rape little Jewish girls, those who rain rockets down upon all Israelis without discrimination – until they come out of their rat holes and are eliminated. Don’t you dare!“It is the obligation of the government of Israel to ensure that every Israeli can live in quiet, peace, and security without fearing that terrorists will overrun their homes or fire missiles at them.“David Ben-Gurion once said that ‘Our future is not dependent on what the goyim, the nations of the world, say, but on what the Jews do.’ And now is the time to do, to act decisively. We did not want to lose in battle Yonadav or any of our brave young men and women. But this war has been forced upon Israel, and we must finish it once and for all.“I say to our government: The People of Israel stand firmly behind you for this purpose, putting aside all internal disagreements. We, our family, already have paid the highest price in grief. Our lives will never be the same. Now you must finish the job, for us, for the fallen soldiers, for our people, for the sake of future generations.“And if you are not up to the task, if you don’t have the guts to win the war – stand aside, vacate your seats at the cabinet table, so that others, better leaders, can take your place.”The writer is senior fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy.

Israel cannot tolerate ceasefires along the way – no truces, no armistices, no fall backs, no restrictions on its use of (overwhelming and simultaneously precise) force – until total victory is achieved.Smoke and flames rise during Israeli strikes, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, in Gaza City, November 9, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/DOAA ROUQA)Complete capitulation orannihilation of Hamasis the goal, nothing less. No more Hamas in Gaza, or in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank). No more Hamas terrorists alive elsewhere in the world either. They all must be hunted down and eliminated.Everyone in Hamas must be hunted down and eliminatedIn the history of modern warfare, there is no more justified military campaign than this one. And only such a campaign to absolutely end the Hamas threat to Israel justifies the heavy losses that Israel already has suffered and the pain of what almost certainly will be further losses.AdvertisementIsraeli leaders have no mandate from the Israeli public to call off or scale back the assault on Hamas. Should they do so, under pressure from well-meaning and fickle allies alike, Israelis will explode in anger, assuredly filling the streets of every city in this country with millions of protesters demanding that the war against Hamas be fully prosecuted. Compromise with Hamas would be defeat. Bending to US President Biden (who, it must be acknowledged, thus far has been rock solid in his backing of Israel) would be considered collapse.OVER THE past 10 days, Israel has buried more than 30 brave warriors – fine and fearless young men pressed into military service to defend their country, many of them with tender wives and beautiful, little, now-orphaned children.One of them was my beloved young friend Yonadav Levenstein, may the Heavens avenge his death. Yonadav was a physical giant (known as the “Viking” of the Givati brigade’s elite reconnaissance unit) and a singer-scholar of a soul. He fought heroically in Nahal Oz on October 7-8, and then in Jabalya and Shati in Gaza before being felled by Palestinian barbarians who popped out of a terrorist attack tunnel.Just two months ago, I danced with him at his wedding to the delicate Hadar Karavani, singing together about happiness and joy in the streets of Jerusalem.Yonadav was the youngest son of my closest friends, Leora and Dr. Michael (Mordechai) Levenstein of Ma’aleh Adumim, who, like me, made aliyah from Canada many decades ago. Tragically, Michael died of cancer three years ago.Michael’s last request, pressed on me the night before he passed away, was to assist Yonadav in his wish to serve in a frontline IDF combat unit. Michael knew that Yonadav’s deepest desire – and, in retrospect, I guess his ultimate task in life – was to fight for the freedom and safety of the Jewish People in the Land of Israel.YONADAV’S ELDEST brother, Elnatan, a prominent lawyer and rising community figure, is a fighter for the Jewish People too, having served in an elite, secret commando unit on Israel’s southern border, and this month in an elite reserve unit on the northern border. I see Elnatan and his cohort as the next generation of Israel’s leaders, a new generation of principled and wise leaders whom this country desperately needs.Elnatan was laying in ambush against Hezbollah when he was called offline to travel home for Yonadav’s funeral on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Standing over the fresh gravesite of his youngest brother, Elnatan gave majestic voice to the defiant demand that the Israeli government stand firm in pursuing the war goals without flinching. This is what he said:“Yonadav, you were intimately familiar with our people’s history. You loved this country with all your heart. You built yourself up and fought to be accepted as a warrior in the Givati reconnaissance unit, where you excelled.“Alas, now you too are part of our history; part of a bloody war that is a historical turning point. A tough but necessary war. A war for the future of our people in our land. A war that should have been over a long time ago, a war that your generation should not have had to fight.“In Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, I and my army unit, along with the entire IDF, were trained and ready to complete the task. We had detailed battle plans and received clear instructions – only to have these plans and orders canceled repeatedly at the last moment. And over the years since then, there were other opportunities (to crush the enemy) that were not taken.“And now, you, little Yonadav, the baby of our family, were forced to fight this fight on behalf of us all.“This war must be Israel’s last war! Otherwise, the price is too high. Yonadav, you and your comrades-in-arms did not die in battle so that others will have to die in yet another war in two or five years’ time. The price that Israeli society has paid since that evil, horrible day of massacres on October 7, Simchat Torah 5784, is intolerable. No more!“Therefore, I call from here upon the prime minister, the minister of defense, other government ministers and decision-makers: Don’t you dare stop! Don’t you dare hesitate! Don’t you dare fold!“Don’t you dare allow even one drop of fuel into accursed Gaza until the rats, the evil terrorists of Hamas-ISIS, those who murder Jewish babies and rape little Jewish girls, those who rain rockets down upon all Israelis without discrimination – until they come out of their rat holes and are eliminated. Don’t you dare!“It is the obligation of the government of Israel to ensure that every Israeli can live in quiet, peace, and security without fearing that terrorists will overrun their homes or fire missiles at them.“David Ben-Gurion once said that ‘Our future is not dependent on what the goyim, the nations of the world, say, but on what the Jews do.’ And now is the time to do, to act decisively. We did not want to lose in battle Yonadav or any of our brave young men and women. But this war has been forced upon Israel, and we must finish it once and for all.“I say to our government: The People of Israel stand firmly behind you for this purpose, putting aside all internal disagreements. We, our family, already have paid the highest price in grief. Our lives will never be the same. Now you must finish the job, for us, for the fallen soldiers, for our people, for the sake of future generations.“And if you are not up to the task, if you don’t have the guts to win the war – stand aside, vacate your seats at the cabinet table, so that others, better leaders, can take your place.”The writer is senior fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy.

Just two months ago, I danced with him at his wedding to the delicate Hadar Karavani, singing together about happiness and joy in the streets of Jerusalem.Yonadav was the youngest son of my closest friends, Leora and Dr. Michael (Mordechai) Levenstein of Ma’aleh Adumim, who, like me, made aliyah from Canada many decades ago. Tragically, Michael died of cancer three years ago.Michael’s last request, pressed on me the night before he passed away, was to assist Yonadav in his wish to serve in a frontline IDF combat unit. Michael knew that Yonadav’s deepest desire – and, in retrospect, I guess his ultimate task in life – was to fight for the freedom and safety of the Jewish People in the Land of Israel.YONADAV’S ELDEST brother, Elnatan, a prominent lawyer and rising community figure, is a fighter for the Jewish People too, having served in an elite, secret commando unit on Israel’s southern border, and this month in an elite reserve unit on the northern border. I see Elnatan and his cohort as the next generation of Israel’s leaders, a new generation of principled and wise leaders whom this country desperately needs.Elnatan was laying in ambush against Hezbollah when he was called offline to travel home for Yonadav’s funeral on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Standing over the fresh gravesite of his youngest brother, Elnatan gave majestic voice to the defiant demand that the Israeli government stand firm in pursuing the war goals without flinching. This is what he said:“Yonadav, you were intimately familiar with our people’s history. You loved this country with all your heart. You built yourself up and fought to be accepted as a warrior in the Givati reconnaissance unit, where you excelled.“Alas, now you too are part of our history; part of a bloody war that is a historical turning point. A tough but necessary war. A war for the future of our people in our land. A war that should have been over a long time ago, a war that your generation should not have had to fight.“In Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, I and my army unit, along with the entire IDF, were trained and ready to complete the task. We had detailed battle plans and received clear instructions – only to have these plans and orders canceled repeatedly at the last moment. And over the years since then, there were other opportunities (to crush the enemy) that were not taken.“And now, you, little Yonadav, the baby of our family, were forced to fight this fight on behalf of us all.“This war must be Israel’s last war! Otherwise, the price is too high. Yonadav, you and your comrades-in-arms did not die in battle so that others will have to die in yet another war in two or five years’ time. The price that Israeli society has paid since that evil, horrible day of massacres on October 7, Simchat Torah 5784, is intolerable. No more!“Therefore, I call from here upon the prime minister, the minister of defense, other government ministers and decision-makers: Don’t you dare stop! Don’t you dare hesitate! Don’t you dare fold!“Don’t you dare allow even one drop of fuel into accursed Gaza until the rats, the evil terrorists of Hamas-ISIS, those who murder Jewish babies and rape little Jewish girls, those who rain rockets down upon all Israelis without discrimination – until they come out of their rat holes and are eliminated.

Liberman to 'Post': Israel's overconfidence led to Hamas's massacre,https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/gaza-news/article-772467,"In 2016,Avigdor Libermanwarned that Hamas was building up terror capabilities and called for a more aggressive policy against the extremist group.“The question is what your conclusions are [resulting] from the same information,” he says. He’s discussing the importance of fresh ideas when approaching information related to intelligence and security issues. This is particularly crucial now in the wake of theHamas attack on October 7that led to the massacre of 1,400 people in Israel.Liberman warned seven years ago that Hamas was building up capabilities and planning a surprise attack using hundreds of terrorists to try to kill and kidnap Israelis.At his office in the Knesset, the longtime leader of the Yisrael Beytenu party casts his gaze backward, then discusses the future.Liberman speaks clearly, with confidence and clarity. He wears a crisp white dress shirt. He understands politics and Israel, having been in these halls for decades. He has also worked closely with Benjamin Netanyahu since the 1990s.MK Avigdor Liberman attends a State Control Committee meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament in Jerusalem, on September 13, 2023. (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)In 2016, Liberman was defense minister. At the time, he saw information relating to Hamas threats.“I joined the Netanyahu-led government in May 2016; already by December 2016, I presented him with... I handed him a paper that I wrote with my advisers describing the scenario we saw on October 7, 2023. I also gave it to [IDF] chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot. I submitted this document to the cabinet in December 2016.”AdvertisementHe says, “My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite from that of our entire military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh approaches.”IN AN interview with theMagazine, Liberman does not dwell on the past, however. He wants a strong future for Israel, and he wants to see Hamas defeated, its leaders targeted, and Israel take back the initiative.He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ “The question is what your conclusions are [resulting] from the same information,” he says.

In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ Liberman warned seven years ago that Hamas was building up capabilities and planning a surprise attack using hundreds of terrorists to try to kill and kidnap Israelis.At his office in the Knesset, the longtime leader of the Yisrael Beytenu party casts his gaze backward, then discusses the future.Liberman speaks clearly, with confidence and clarity. He wears a crisp white dress shirt. He understands politics and Israel, having been in these halls for decades. He has also worked closely with Benjamin Netanyahu since the 1990s.MK Avigdor Liberman attends a State Control Committee meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament in Jerusalem, on September 13, 2023. (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)In 2016, Liberman was defense minister. At the time, he saw information relating to Hamas threats.“I joined the Netanyahu-led government in May 2016; already by December 2016, I presented him with... I handed him a paper that I wrote with my advisers describing the scenario we saw on October 7, 2023. I also gave it to [IDF] chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot. I submitted this document to the cabinet in December 2016.”AdvertisementHe says, “My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite from that of our entire military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh approaches.”IN AN interview with theMagazine, Liberman does not dwell on the past, however. He wants a strong future for Israel, and he wants to see Hamas defeated, its leaders targeted, and Israel take back the initiative.He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission.

We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ Liberman speaks clearly, with confidence and clarity. He wears a crisp white dress shirt. He understands politics and Israel, having been in these halls for decades. He has also worked closely with Benjamin Netanyahu since the 1990s.MK Avigdor Liberman attends a State Control Committee meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament in Jerusalem, on September 13, 2023. (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)In 2016, Liberman was defense minister. At the time, he saw information relating to Hamas threats.“I joined the Netanyahu-led government in May 2016; already by December 2016, I presented him with... I handed him a paper that I wrote with my advisers describing the scenario we saw on October 7, 2023. I also gave it to [IDF] chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot. I submitted this document to the cabinet in December 2016.”AdvertisementHe says, “My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite from that of our entire military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh approaches.”IN AN interview with theMagazine, Liberman does not dwell on the past, however. He wants a strong future for Israel, and he wants to see Hamas defeated, its leaders targeted, and Israel take back the initiative.He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings.

At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ “I joined the Netanyahu-led government in May 2016; already by December 2016, I presented him with... I handed him a paper that I wrote with my advisers describing the scenario we saw on October 7, 2023. I also gave it to [IDF] chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot. I submitted this document to the cabinet in December 2016.”AdvertisementHe says, “My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite from that of our entire military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh approaches.”IN AN interview with theMagazine, Liberman does not dwell on the past, however. He wants a strong future for Israel, and he wants to see Hamas defeated, its leaders targeted, and Israel take back the initiative.He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees.

In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt.

[Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions.

We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately.

When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ “It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force.

Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis.

Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure.

It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others.

It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure.

As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union.

According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees.

We are back to the Cold War.

They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry.

But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel.

Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees.

He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings.

I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power.

"Mavi Marmara, group behind 2010 Gaza flotilla clash, plans to launch new ship into Gaza",https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-773443,"The Turkey-based Mavi Marmara organization, which infamously participated in the “Gaza Freedom Flotilla” of ships into waters off of the coastal enclave in 2010 and fought with IDF naval forces, announced on Wednesday new plans to launch another flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza.“We are setting out again towards Gaza as a civil and independent movement, in line with the decision we made with the International Freedom Flotilla, of which we are a member,” the organization announced in a statement.Members of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition have held meetings in London to plan the next flotilla from Europe to Gaza, which is set to sail next year in an attempt to break the naval blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip.“Our goals remain full human rights for all Palestinians,” the group wrote on its official website about its next flotilla: “In particular, freedom of movement within historic Palestine and the right of return.""Mavi Marmaraoperated one of the 37 ships that were part of the 2010 flotilla – a passenger ship carrying over 600 passengers. IDF forces boarded the ship after it refused to reroute to the Port of Ashdod and were met with violent resistance by the passengers.English-language flyer declaring Mavi Marmara's intention to participate in the next Gaza Freedom Flotilla. (credit: MAVI MARMARA ORGANIZATION)“We are setting out again towards Gaza against the blockade in Palestine with ship fleets formed from different countries. Support the purchase of ships for the fleet and the supply of humanitarian aid materials, and raise your voice against the blockade and embargo,” the statement said.“Now is the time to end the blockade and embargo,” the flyer made by Mavi Marmara declares.Advertisement2010 Gaza Flotilla disasterThe original Gaza Freedom Flotilla arrived in Israeli waters in May 2010. After multiple warnings, IDF naval forces intercepted six groups of ships that were on their way to Gaza. The flotilla was sponsored by the Free Gaza Movement (FGM), several European Palestinian solidarity organizations, and Insani Yardim Vakfi (IHH), an Istanbul-based Islamic charity fund that has ties to Hamas.Members on board one of the largest ships in the flotillas –theMavi Marmarathat disembarked from Turkey– attacked the IDF with weapons. Israeli commandos descended on ropes from helicopters onto the ship and were immediately attacked with clubs, knives, and metal rods. Three soldiers were taken captive. Israeli troops opened fire after a protester, later identified as Ken O’Keefe, a former US marine, seized a gun from one of them.As a result of the clash on theMavi Marmara, ten flotilla members were killed and dozens were wounded. Ten Israeli soldiers were also wounded during the attack. The other five flotilla ships did not engage in fighting with the IDF, instead sailing to the Port of Ashdod and returning to their home countries.Anna Ahronheim contributed to this report. “We are setting out again towards Gaza as a civil and independent movement, in line with the decision we made with the International Freedom Flotilla, of which we are a member,” the organization announced in a statement.Members of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition have held meetings in London to plan the next flotilla from Europe to Gaza, which is set to sail next year in an attempt to break the naval blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip.“Our goals remain full human rights for all Palestinians,” the group wrote on its official website about its next flotilla: “In particular, freedom of movement within historic Palestine and the right of return.""Mavi Marmaraoperated one of the 37 ships that were part of the 2010 flotilla – a passenger ship carrying over 600 passengers.

Vandalized Anne Frank mural sparks outrage in Milan,https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-773283,"In a shocking act of vandalism, two powerful murals addressing antisemitism and the horrors of the Holocaust were defaced in Milan, Italy. The murals, created bycontemporary artist aleXsandro Palombo, featured Anne Frank and theiconic Warsaw Ghetto Boy.“Innocence, Hate and Hope” Anne Frank cries, the Warsaw ghetto boy and a little girl from Gaza.#streetartby aleXsandro Palombo in Milan#FreePalestine#HamasTerrorists#IsraelPalestineConflictpic.twitter.com/nsxxv19ENg— aleXsandro Palombo (@PalomboArtist)November 9, 2023The first mural, situated in the central Piazza Castello, depicted Frank crying while holding the Israeli flag. It was intended as a symbol against antisemitism. However, within 24 hours of its unveiling, the mural was vandalized and covered with large ""FREE GAZA"" writings. The second mural, located in the Porta Nuova Project area, portrayed the Warsaw Ghetto Boy with raised hands, a symbol of the Holocaust. Sadly, this mural too was defaced, erasing the child entirely.""These artworks were meant to send a powerful message against antisemitism and hatred,"" said Palombo, expressing his disappointment over thevandalism of his artwork.Anne Frank street art by aleXsandro Palombo (credit: ALEXSANDRO PALOMBO)Italian Deputy PM condemns the vandalismThese artworks, part of Palombo's ""Innocence, Hate, and Hope"" series, appeared in Milan a month after the Hamas attack against Israel. They aimed to address the rising wave of antisemitism, terrorism, and denied childhood. The sudden appearance of the artist's works in various locations across the city sparked both appreciation and controversy.Matteo Salvini, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Italian government, expressed his condemnation of the vandalism, denouncing the act against the artist's murals. ""Such actions have no place in our society.

It was intended as a symbol against antisemitism. However, within 24 hours of its unveiling, the mural was vandalized and covered with large ""FREE GAZA"" writings. The second mural, located in the Porta Nuova Project area, portrayed the Warsaw Ghetto Boy with raised hands, a symbol of the Holocaust. Sadly, this mural too was defaced, erasing the child entirely. “Innocence, Hate and Hope” Anne Frank cries, the Warsaw ghetto boy and a little girl from Gaza.#streetartby aleXsandro Palombo in Milan#FreePalestine#HamasTerrorists#IsraelPalestineConflictpic.twitter.com/nsxxv19ENg ""These artworks were meant to send a powerful message against antisemitism and hatred,"" said Palombo, expressing his disappointment over thevandalism of his artwork.Anne Frank street art by aleXsandro Palombo (credit: ALEXSANDRO PALOMBO)Italian Deputy PM condemns the vandalismThese artworks, part of Palombo's ""Innocence, Hate, and Hope"" series, appeared in Milan a month after the Hamas attack against Israel.

Mothers on the frontlines: The milk bank saving babies in wartime,https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-773062,"The phrase ""Don't cry over spilled milk"" often reminds us of life's minor setbacks, but atMagen David Adom's(MDA) National Human Milk Bank of Israel in Ramla, every drop is invaluable. In this unique venue, voluntary donations undergo rigorous processing, including controlled pasteurization, before aiding premature and medically fragile infants.This initiative is led by Dr. Sharron Bransburg-Zabary, the bank's director; Hadar Amit, the donor coordinator; and Miriam Farhat, a staff member. During the first three weeks ofOperation Swords of Iron, the bank provided over 600 liters ofbreast milk to babiesin dire need, including those orphaned or whose mothers were incapacitated or deployed. Before the conflict, about 750 donors were registered, and an additional 200 joined during the crisis, with 700 more awaiting approval.Optimal quality and safetyShortly before the war,Maarivvisited this crucial facility. During that visit, Amit outlined the stringent donor screening process, ensuring both donor and recipient safety. Farhat highlighted the meticulous journey from collection to delivery, emphasizing cleanliness and safety. Bransburg-Zabary elaborated on the extensive testing and pasteurization procedures, ensuring optimal quality and safety.National Human Milk Bank of Israel (credit: Ofir Berman)Milk from different mothersBransburg-Zabary spoke passionately about the process, ""The donated milk undergoes pasteurization and lab tests to ensure quality and measure characteristics like fat levels. Each batch combines milk from different mothers, exposing babies to antibodies against various diseases.""Farhat highlighted the meticulous care taken, ""The milk undergoes extensive testing to guarantee cleanliness,"" ensuring the safety from pumping to delivery.Amit shed light on the donor experience, explaining the thorough medical eligibility checks and the balance donors maintain between donating and caring for their own babies.National Human Milk Bank of Israel (credit: Ofir Berman)The bank's operations were significantly impacted by the conflict. Before the war, around 170 liters were distributed monthly, with each batch comprising milk from five or six mothers. The demand surged during the conflict, necessitating manual filling, sealing, and marking of each bottle, especially critical for infants weighing less than half a kilogram.AdvertisementBransburg-Zabari reassured the Israeli public about the safety and efficacy of the bank's processes, emphasizing their tripled capacity and rigorous quality control system. The bank also said it welcomes contributions from surrogates and mothers commemorating life after challenging births or losses.Dr Sharron Bransburg-Zabary Director National Human Milk Bank of Israel (credit: MDA)Reflecting on the impact, Bransburg-Zabari said, ""Women on the front lines is no longer a question mark. Mothers in reserves today should know their children are in good hands, receiving essential nourishment and a mother's love, regardless of biological ties.""One touching rescue story involves a premature baby whose life was saved by the bank's intervention.

"IDF slows down operation in Gaza, raising questions about military focus - comment",https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-773014,"The recent decline in the intensity of the IDF operation againstHamas in the Gaza Striphas raised questions about the IDF's commitment. The notable decrease in airstrikes and artillery fire, indicated by fewer explosions, suggests a reduction in offensive actions.Instead,IDF soldiersare focusing on clearing the areas under their control and dismantling military infrastructure, although their activities are limited. This is especially true in the Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City. Security sources have revealed that any decision to expand the IDF's ground operation in Gaza, or to shift focus toHezbollah in Lebanon, requires approval from higher political authorities.IDF refuted claims of wider offensive against HezbollahThe office of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has neither confirmed nor denied support for an escalated attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon. They have stated that their actions are in line with the cabinet's decisions, underscoring the ongoing operations in Gaza. In contrast, the IDF has refuted claims of advocating for a wider offensive against Hezbollah.(credit: INGIMAGE)Senior officials have emphasized that their current primary focus is on the Gaza Strip. However, they also recognize the importance of securing the region to facilitate the safe return of residents to settlements near the Lebanese border and nearby areas.The IDF's apparent lack of momentum in achieving its war objectives in Gaza has created a sense of uncertainty.

"Jewish, Arab Israelis distribute packages to families displaced by Hamas",https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/article-773012,"From the harrowing tales of hostages in Gaza to the profound distress observed following theOctober 7 massacre, social media has been flooded with stories that stir a wide spectrum of emotions. Amid this despair, a ray of hope emerged over the weekend through a video that celebrated the ideals of bravery, conscience, humanity, and generosity.This video spotlighted Aya Midan, a Kibbutz Be'eri resident,whose life was savedby the courageous Alkarinawi family from Rahrat, a predominantly Arab Bedouin city in the Southern District. They risked their lives to rescue dozens of others. Produced by ""Have You Seen the Horizon Lately,"" an organization championing Jewish-Arab partnership, the video amassed over 2.5 million views, and conveyed the message, ""We are coming to take you; you are not alone.""Conversations in Hebrew and ArabicThis video's impact led to a surge in volunteering and support, culminating in unprecedented participation at the joint Jewish community center inRahat. Every Wednesday, the center becomes a hive of activity where hundreds of Jewish andBedouinIsraelis, especially women, gather to pack boxes with food, toys, and hygiene products. The environment thrives on a bilingual buzz, with conversations in both Hebrew and Arabic.Half of the assembled aid packages are allocated to Jewish families in nearby towns, and the other half to Bedouin families in Rahat and adjacent Negev villages.מתוך הטבח הנורא עלו סיפורי גבורה יוצאי דופן - צפו בסיפור המדהים מה-7 לאוקטובר שנחשף היוםpic.twitter.com/VbaqM6E409— האם ראית את האופק לאחרונה? (@Horizon_lately)November 3, 2023TheHamalinitiative, aptly named ""war room,"" is a collaborative effort born from the partnership between Shir Nosetsky, CEO of Have You Seen the Horizon Lately?, and attorney Hanan Alsana from the association Itach Ma’aki – Women Lawyers for Social Justice.Its efforts have caught the attention of high-profile figures like President Isaac Herzog, National Unity Party chairman Benny Gantz, Interior Minister Moshe Arbel, and German Ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert.AdvertisementThe video featuring Midan's story ignited a new wave of support, bolstering not only the relief efforts but also reinforcing the message of a shared destiny among diverse communities.The urgency of these efforts is underscored by the grim statistics from Gaza, where 240 people, including seven members from the Bedouin and Arab communities in the Negev, were taken hostage by Hamas. This figure includes four family members from Rahat.Rahat Mayor Ata Abu Madiam voiced the community's collective anguish and stressed the critical need for bridging differences in these trying times.""Many were unaware of Hamas's true nature""Talal Alkarinawi, a social activist from Rahrat and related to the heroes in Midan's rescue video, views the events of October 7 as a pivotal moment for the Bedouin community. He pointed out a critical misconception that existed among some people who mistakenly believed that Hamas was a legitimate entity fighting for land rights and the freedom of prisoners.Alkarinawi emphasized that many were unaware of Hamas's true nature, which he compares to ISIS, known for its indiscriminate violence and brutality against all, including Arabs. This realization brought to light the importance of understanding and distinguishing between legitimate political activism and violent extremism.(credit: official site)Alkarinawi is of the opinion that initiatives like this are instrumental in rebuilding trust and displaying the Bedouin community's commitment to peaceful coexistence. He sees these efforts as a testament to their ability to live in harmony alongside Jewish neighbors. He shared that since its establishment, the initiative has been ""a beacon of hope and solidarity,"" successfully delivering aid packages to over two thousand families, ""and it shows no signs of slowing down."" The remarkable outpouring of support from both Jewish and Arab communities is a clear indication of a growing spirit of unity and mutual understanding, bridging divides and fostering a sense of shared community and purpose.(credit: official site)Nosetsky, a key figure behind Midan's video and other Jewish-Arab heroic narratives, underscored a significant point: ""In critical moments, the Arab community has consistently shown support for Jews and the IDF, rather than Hamas.""

This video's impact led to a surge in volunteering and support, culminating in unprecedented participation at the joint Jewish community center inRahat. Every Wednesday, the center becomes a hive of activity where hundreds of Jewish andBedouinIsraelis, especially women, gather to pack boxes with food, toys, and hygiene products. The environment thrives on a bilingual buzz, with conversations in both Hebrew and Arabic.Half of the assembled aid packages are allocated to Jewish families in nearby towns, and the other half to Bedouin families in Rahat and adjacent Negev villages.מתוך הטבח הנורא עלו סיפורי גבורה יוצאי דופן - צפו בסיפור המדהים מה-7 לאוקטובר שנחשף היוםpic.twitter.com/VbaqM6E409— האם ראית את האופק לאחרונה?

Hamas planned to push October 7 massacre to the West Bank border - report,https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/gaza-news/article-772934,"Hamas's original plan forOctober 7went beyond just a massacre in the Gaza border area and taking hundreds of hostages, but to continue their assault up to the border with the West Bank,The Washington Postreported Sunday, citing Western and Middle Eastern security officials briefed on collected evidence.This information was obtained from numerous maps, notes, supplies, and other written instructions found among the bodies of dead Hamas terrorists in the Gaza border area, as well as from interrogations of Hamas captives.""We know from interrogations that Hamas came in with detailed plans of their attack, including which commander should rape which soldiers in different places,"" Defense Minister Yoav Gallant explained toThe Washington Post,though the quote has since been removed from the original report.Hamas planned to go much farther into Israel on October 7On October 7, Hamas terrorists executed a meticulously planned mass infiltration of Israel, under the cover of a heavy rocket bombardment. There, they managed to wreak havoc on at least 22 Israeli towns and military outposts near the Gaza border throughout the day, killing around 1,200 Israelis and abducting hundreds of people to bring back to Gaza as hostages.The farthest the Hamas terrorists were able to infiltrate was the city of Ofakim in the Western Negev, around halfway between Gaza and the West Bank.Children's toys and personal items lie on the bloodstained floor of a child's bedroom, following a deadly infiltration by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip, in Kibbutz Beeri in southern Israel October 17, 2023.

Israeli leaders don't have the authority to let anyone in Hamas live - opinion,https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-772536,"Pressures on Israel from Washington and other Western capitals are mounting to curtail the campaign todestroy Hamas, because of the humanitarian toll in Gaza.Israeli government leaders must resist these pressures with all their might. They must persist in pounding Hamas-ISIS to smithereens until every last Hamas commander is dead, every lastHamas terror attack tunnelis destroyed, and every last Hamas missile bunker is obliterated.That is the only justification for the tenure of this government; that is its promise to Israeli society. That is the only way Israel can restore basic security to a battered and traumatized public, the only way Israelis will return to their homes in the Negev and the Galilee.It is the only way Israel can restore some of its deterrent posture and survive in the predatory Middle East. It is the only way Israel stands a chance of pushing back against radical Islam’s attempt to strangulate Israel and achieve regional hegemony.The war cannot and must not end until Israel has achieved its legitimate military objectives in full, with no fudging, no obfuscations, and no hesitations. Israel cannot tolerate ceasefires along the way – no truces, no armistices, no fall backs, no restrictions on its use of (overwhelming and simultaneously precise) force – until total victory is achieved.Smoke and flames rise during Israeli strikes, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, in Gaza City, November 9, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/DOAA ROUQA)Complete capitulation orannihilation of Hamasis the goal, nothing less. No more Hamas in Gaza, or in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank). No more Hamas terrorists alive elsewhere in the world either. They all must be hunted down and eliminated.Everyone in Hamas must be hunted down and eliminatedIn the history of modern warfare, there is no more justified military campaign than this one. And only such a campaign to absolutely end the Hamas threat to Israel justifies the heavy losses that Israel already has suffered and the pain of what almost certainly will be further losses.AdvertisementIsraeli leaders have no mandate from the Israeli public to call off or scale back the assault on Hamas. Should they do so, under pressure from well-meaning and fickle allies alike, Israelis will explode in anger, assuredly filling the streets of every city in this country with millions of protesters demanding that the war against Hamas be fully prosecuted. Compromise with Hamas would be defeat. Bending to US President Biden (who, it must be acknowledged, thus far has been rock solid in his backing of Israel) would be considered collapse.OVER THE past 10 days, Israel has buried more than 30 brave warriors – fine and fearless young men pressed into military service to defend their country, many of them with tender wives and beautiful, little, now-orphaned children.One of them was my beloved young friend Yonadav Levenstein, may the Heavens avenge his death. Yonadav was a physical giant (known as the “Viking” of the Givati brigade’s elite reconnaissance unit) and a singer-scholar of a soul. He fought heroically in Nahal Oz on October 7-8, and then in Jabalya and Shati in Gaza before being felled by Palestinian barbarians who popped out of a terrorist attack tunnel.Just two months ago, I danced with him at his wedding to the delicate Hadar Karavani, singing together about happiness and joy in the streets of Jerusalem.Yonadav was the youngest son of my closest friends, Leora and Dr. Michael (Mordechai) Levenstein of Ma’aleh Adumim, who, like me, made aliyah from Canada many decades ago. Tragically, Michael died of cancer three years ago.Michael’s last request, pressed on me the night before he passed away, was to assist Yonadav in his wish to serve in a frontline IDF combat unit. Michael knew that Yonadav’s deepest desire – and, in retrospect, I guess his ultimate task in life – was to fight for the freedom and safety of the Jewish People in the Land of Israel.YONADAV’S ELDEST brother, Elnatan, a prominent lawyer and rising community figure, is a fighter for the Jewish People too, having served in an elite, secret commando unit on Israel’s southern border, and this month in an elite reserve unit on the northern border. I see Elnatan and his cohort as the next generation of Israel’s leaders, a new generation of principled and wise leaders whom this country desperately needs.Elnatan was laying in ambush against Hezbollah when he was called offline to travel home for Yonadav’s funeral on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Standing over the fresh gravesite of his youngest brother, Elnatan gave majestic voice to the defiant demand that the Israeli government stand firm in pursuing the war goals without flinching. This is what he said:“Yonadav, you were intimately familiar with our people’s history. You loved this country with all your heart. You built yourself up and fought to be accepted as a warrior in the Givati reconnaissance unit, where you excelled.“Alas, now you too are part of our history; part of a bloody war that is a historical turning point. A tough but necessary war. A war for the future of our people in our land. A war that should have been over a long time ago, a war that your generation should not have had to fight.“In Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, I and my army unit, along with the entire IDF, were trained and ready to complete the task. We had detailed battle plans and received clear instructions – only to have these plans and orders canceled repeatedly at the last moment. And over the years since then, there were other opportunities (to crush the enemy) that were not taken.“And now, you, little Yonadav, the baby of our family, were forced to fight this fight on behalf of us all.“This war must be Israel’s last war! Otherwise, the price is too high. Yonadav, you and your comrades-in-arms did not die in battle so that others will have to die in yet another war in two or five years’ time. The price that Israeli society has paid since that evil, horrible day of massacres on October 7, Simchat Torah 5784, is intolerable. No more!“Therefore, I call from here upon the prime minister, the minister of defense, other government ministers and decision-makers: Don’t you dare stop! Don’t you dare hesitate! Don’t you dare fold!“Don’t you dare allow even one drop of fuel into accursed Gaza until the rats, the evil terrorists of Hamas-ISIS, those who murder Jewish babies and rape little Jewish girls, those who rain rockets down upon all Israelis without discrimination – until they come out of their rat holes and are eliminated. Don’t you dare!“It is the obligation of the government of Israel to ensure that every Israeli can live in quiet, peace, and security without fearing that terrorists will overrun their homes or fire missiles at them.“David Ben-Gurion once said that ‘Our future is not dependent on what the goyim, the nations of the world, say, but on what the Jews do.’ And now is the time to do, to act decisively. We did not want to lose in battle Yonadav or any of our brave young men and women. But this war has been forced upon Israel, and we must finish it once and for all.“I say to our government: The People of Israel stand firmly behind you for this purpose, putting aside all internal disagreements. We, our family, already have paid the highest price in grief. Our lives will never be the same. Now you must finish the job, for us, for the fallen soldiers, for our people, for the sake of future generations.“And if you are not up to the task, if you don’t have the guts to win the war – stand aside, vacate your seats at the cabinet table, so that others, better leaders, can take your place.”The writer is senior fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy. The views expressed here are his own. His diplomatic, defense, political, and Jewish world columns over the past 27 years are at davidmweinberg.com.

You built yourself up and fought to be accepted as a warrior in the Givati reconnaissance unit, where you excelled.“Alas, now you too are part of our history; part of a bloody war that is a historical turning point. A tough but necessary war. A war for the future of our people in our land. A war that should have been over a long time ago, a war that your generation should not have had to fight.“In Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, I and my army unit, along with the entire IDF, were trained and ready to complete the task. We had detailed battle plans and received clear instructions – only to have these plans and orders canceled repeatedly at the last moment. And over the years since then, there were other opportunities (to crush the enemy) that were not taken.“And now, you, little Yonadav, the baby of our family, were forced to fight this fight on behalf of us all.“This war must be Israel’s last war! Otherwise, the price is too high. Yonadav, you and your comrades-in-arms did not die in battle so that others will have to die in yet another war in two or five years’ time. The price that Israeli society has paid since that evil, horrible day of massacres on October 7, Simchat Torah 5784, is intolerable. No more!“Therefore, I call from here upon the prime minister, the minister of defense, other government ministers and decision-makers: Don’t you dare stop! Don’t you dare hesitate! Don’t you dare fold!“Don’t you dare allow even one drop of fuel into accursed Gaza until the rats, the evil terrorists of Hamas-ISIS, those who murder Jewish babies and rape little Jewish girls, those who rain rockets down upon all Israelis without discrimination – until they come out of their rat holes and are eliminated. Don’t you dare!“It is the obligation of the government of Israel to ensure that every Israeli can live in quiet, peace, and security without fearing that terrorists will overrun their homes or fire missiles at them.“David Ben-Gurion once said that ‘Our future is not dependent on what the goyim, the nations of the world, say, but on what the Jews do.’ And now is the time to do, to act decisively. We did not want to lose in battle Yonadav or any of our brave young men and women. But this war has been forced upon Israel, and we must finish it once and for all.“I say to our government: The People of Israel stand firmly behind you for this purpose, putting aside all internal disagreements. We, our family, already have paid the highest price in grief. Our lives will never be the same. Now you must finish the job, for us, for the fallen soldiers, for our people, for the sake of future generations.“And if you are not up to the task, if you don’t have the guts to win the war – stand aside, vacate your seats at the cabinet table, so that others, better leaders, can take your place.”The writer is senior fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy.

That is the only justification for the tenure of this government; that is its promise to Israeli society. That is the only way Israel can restore basic security to a battered and traumatized public, the only way Israelis will return to their homes in the Negev and the Galilee.It is the only way Israel can restore some of its deterrent posture and survive in the predatory Middle East. It is the only way Israel stands a chance of pushing back against radical Islam’s attempt to strangulate Israel and achieve regional hegemony.The war cannot and must not end until Israel has achieved its legitimate military objectives in full, with no fudging, no obfuscations, and no hesitations. Israel cannot tolerate ceasefires along the way – no truces, no armistices, no fall backs, no restrictions on its use of (overwhelming and simultaneously precise) force – until total victory is achieved.Smoke and flames rise during Israeli strikes, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, in Gaza City, November 9, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/DOAA ROUQA)Complete capitulation orannihilation of Hamasis the goal, nothing less. No more Hamas in Gaza, or in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank). No more Hamas terrorists alive elsewhere in the world either. They all must be hunted down and eliminated.Everyone in Hamas must be hunted down and eliminatedIn the history of modern warfare, there is no more justified military campaign than this one. And only such a campaign to absolutely end the Hamas threat to Israel justifies the heavy losses that Israel already has suffered and the pain of what almost certainly will be further losses.AdvertisementIsraeli leaders have no mandate from the Israeli public to call off or scale back the assault on Hamas. Should they do so, under pressure from well-meaning and fickle allies alike, Israelis will explode in anger, assuredly filling the streets of every city in this country with millions of protesters demanding that the war against Hamas be fully prosecuted. Compromise with Hamas would be defeat. Bending to US President Biden (who, it must be acknowledged, thus far has been rock solid in his backing of Israel) would be considered collapse.OVER THE past 10 days, Israel has buried more than 30 brave warriors – fine and fearless young men pressed into military service to defend their country, many of them with tender wives and beautiful, little, now-orphaned children.One of them was my beloved young friend Yonadav Levenstein, may the Heavens avenge his death. Yonadav was a physical giant (known as the “Viking” of the Givati brigade’s elite reconnaissance unit) and a singer-scholar of a soul. He fought heroically in Nahal Oz on October 7-8, and then in Jabalya and Shati in Gaza before being felled by Palestinian barbarians who popped out of a terrorist attack tunnel.Just two months ago, I danced with him at his wedding to the delicate Hadar Karavani, singing together about happiness and joy in the streets of Jerusalem.Yonadav was the youngest son of my closest friends, Leora and Dr. Michael (Mordechai) Levenstein of Ma’aleh Adumim, who, like me, made aliyah from Canada many decades ago. Tragically, Michael died of cancer three years ago.Michael’s last request, pressed on me the night before he passed away, was to assist Yonadav in his wish to serve in a frontline IDF combat unit. Michael knew that Yonadav’s deepest desire – and, in retrospect, I guess his ultimate task in life – was to fight for the freedom and safety of the Jewish People in the Land of Israel.YONADAV’S ELDEST brother, Elnatan, a prominent lawyer and rising community figure, is a fighter for the Jewish People too, having served in an elite, secret commando unit on Israel’s southern border, and this month in an elite reserve unit on the northern border. I see Elnatan and his cohort as the next generation of Israel’s leaders, a new generation of principled and wise leaders whom this country desperately needs.Elnatan was laying in ambush against Hezbollah when he was called offline to travel home for Yonadav’s funeral on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.

Don’t you dare fold!“Don’t you dare allow even one drop of fuel into accursed Gaza until the rats, the evil terrorists of Hamas-ISIS, those who murder Jewish babies and rape little Jewish girls, those who rain rockets down upon all Israelis without discrimination – until they come out of their rat holes and are eliminated. Don’t you dare!“It is the obligation of the government of Israel to ensure that every Israeli can live in quiet, peace, and security without fearing that terrorists will overrun their homes or fire missiles at them.“David Ben-Gurion once said that ‘Our future is not dependent on what the goyim, the nations of the world, say, but on what the Jews do.’ And now is the time to do, to act decisively. We did not want to lose in battle Yonadav or any of our brave young men and women. But this war has been forced upon Israel, and we must finish it once and for all.“I say to our government: The People of Israel stand firmly behind you for this purpose, putting aside all internal disagreements. We, our family, already have paid the highest price in grief. Our lives will never be the same. Now you must finish the job, for us, for the fallen soldiers, for our people, for the sake of future generations.“And if you are not up to the task, if you don’t have the guts to win the war – stand aside, vacate your seats at the cabinet table, so that others, better leaders, can take your place.”The writer is senior fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy. The views expressed here are his own. His diplomatic, defense, political, and Jewish world columns over the past 27 years are at davidmweinberg.com. Israeli leaders have no mandate from the Israeli public to call off or scale back the assault on Hamas. Should they do so, under pressure from well-meaning and fickle allies alike, Israelis will explode in anger, assuredly filling the streets of every city in this country with millions of protesters demanding that the war against Hamas be fully prosecuted. Compromise with Hamas would be defeat. Bending to US President Biden (who, it must be acknowledged, thus far has been rock solid in his backing of Israel) would be considered collapse.OVER THE past 10 days, Israel has buried more than 30 brave warriors – fine and fearless young men pressed into military service to defend their country, many of them with tender wives and beautiful, little, now-orphaned children.One of them was my beloved young friend Yonadav Levenstein, may the Heavens avenge his death. Yonadav was a physical giant (known as the “Viking” of the Givati brigade’s elite reconnaissance unit) and a singer-scholar of a soul. He fought heroically in Nahal Oz on October 7-8, and then in Jabalya and Shati in Gaza before being felled by Palestinian barbarians who popped out of a terrorist attack tunnel.Just two months ago, I danced with him at his wedding to the delicate Hadar Karavani, singing together about happiness and joy in the streets of Jerusalem.Yonadav was the youngest son of my closest friends, Leora and Dr. Michael (Mordechai) Levenstein of Ma’aleh Adumim, who, like me, made aliyah from Canada many decades ago. Tragically, Michael died of cancer three years ago.Michael’s last request, pressed on me the night before he passed away, was to assist Yonadav in his wish to serve in a frontline IDF combat unit. Michael knew that Yonadav’s deepest desire – and, in retrospect, I guess his ultimate task in life – was to fight for the freedom and safety of the Jewish People in the Land of Israel.YONADAV’S ELDEST brother, Elnatan, a prominent lawyer and rising community figure, is a fighter for the Jewish People too, having served in an elite, secret commando unit on Israel’s southern border, and this month in an elite reserve unit on the northern border. I see Elnatan and his cohort as the next generation of Israel’s leaders, a new generation of principled and wise leaders whom this country desperately needs.Elnatan was laying in ambush against Hezbollah when he was called offline to travel home for Yonadav’s funeral on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Standing over the fresh gravesite of his youngest brother, Elnatan gave majestic voice to the defiant demand that the Israeli government stand firm in pursuing the war goals without flinching. This is what he said:“Yonadav, you were intimately familiar with our people’s history. You loved this country with all your heart. You built yourself up and fought to be accepted as a warrior in the Givati reconnaissance unit, where you excelled.“Alas, now you too are part of our history; part of a bloody war that is a historical turning point. A tough but necessary war. A war for the future of our people in our land. A war that should have been over a long time ago, a war that your generation should not have had to fight.“In Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, I and my army unit, along with the entire IDF, were trained and ready to complete the task. We had detailed battle plans and received clear instructions – only to have these plans and orders canceled repeatedly at the last moment. And over the years since then, there were other opportunities (to crush the enemy) that were not taken.“And now, you, little Yonadav, the baby of our family, were forced to fight this fight on behalf of us all.“This war must be Israel’s last war! Otherwise, the price is too high. Yonadav, you and your comrades-in-arms did not die in battle so that others will have to die in yet another war in two or five years’ time.

Elnatan was laying in ambush against Hezbollah when he was called offline to travel home for Yonadav’s funeral on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Standing over the fresh gravesite of his youngest brother, Elnatan gave majestic voice to the defiant demand that the Israeli government stand firm in pursuing the war goals without flinching. This is what he said:“Yonadav, you were intimately familiar with our people’s history. You loved this country with all your heart. You built yourself up and fought to be accepted as a warrior in the Givati reconnaissance unit, where you excelled.“Alas, now you too are part of our history; part of a bloody war that is a historical turning point. A tough but necessary war. A war for the future of our people in our land. A war that should have been over a long time ago, a war that your generation should not have had to fight.“In Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, I and my army unit, along with the entire IDF, were trained and ready to complete the task. We had detailed battle plans and received clear instructions – only to have these plans and orders canceled repeatedly at the last moment. And over the years since then, there were other opportunities (to crush the enemy) that were not taken.“And now, you, little Yonadav, the baby of our family, were forced to fight this fight on behalf of us all.“This war must be Israel’s last war! Otherwise, the price is too high. Yonadav, you and your comrades-in-arms did not die in battle so that others will have to die in yet another war in two or five years’ time. The price that Israeli society has paid since that evil, horrible day of massacres on October 7, Simchat Torah 5784, is intolerable. No more!“Therefore, I call from here upon the prime minister, the minister of defense, other government ministers and decision-makers: Don’t you dare stop! Don’t you dare hesitate! Don’t you dare fold!“Don’t you dare allow even one drop of fuel into accursed Gaza until the rats, the evil terrorists of Hamas-ISIS, those who murder Jewish babies and rape little Jewish girls, those who rain rockets down upon all Israelis without discrimination – until they come out of their rat holes and are eliminated. Don’t you dare!“It is the obligation of the government of Israel to ensure that every Israeli can live in quiet, peace, and security without fearing that terrorists will overrun their homes or fire missiles at them.“David Ben-Gurion once said that ‘Our future is not dependent on what the goyim, the nations of the world, say, but on what the Jews do.’ And now is the time to do, to act decisively.

Liberman to 'Post': Israel's overconfidence led to Hamas's massacre,https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/gaza-news/article-772467,"In 2016,Avigdor Libermanwarned that Hamas was building up terror capabilities and called for a more aggressive policy against the extremist group.“The question is what your conclusions are [resulting] from the same information,” he says. He’s discussing the importance of fresh ideas when approaching information related to intelligence and security issues. This is particularly crucial now in the wake of theHamas attack on October 7that led to the massacre of 1,400 people in Israel.Liberman warned seven years ago that Hamas was building up capabilities and planning a surprise attack using hundreds of terrorists to try to kill and kidnap Israelis.At his office in the Knesset, the longtime leader of the Yisrael Beytenu party casts his gaze backward, then discusses the future.Liberman speaks clearly, with confidence and clarity. He wears a crisp white dress shirt. He understands politics and Israel, having been in these halls for decades. He has also worked closely with Benjamin Netanyahu since the 1990s.MK Avigdor Liberman attends a State Control Committee meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament in Jerusalem, on September 13, 2023. (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)In 2016, Liberman was defense minister. At the time, he saw information relating to Hamas threats.“I joined the Netanyahu-led government in May 2016; already by December 2016, I presented him with... I handed him a paper that I wrote with my advisers describing the scenario we saw on October 7, 2023. I also gave it to [IDF] chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot. I submitted this document to the cabinet in December 2016.”AdvertisementHe says, “My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite from that of our entire military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh approaches.”IN AN interview with theMagazine, Liberman does not dwell on the past, however. He wants a strong future for Israel, and he wants to see Hamas defeated, its leaders targeted, and Israel take back the initiative.He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ “The question is what your conclusions are [resulting] from the same information,” he says. He’s discussing the importance of fresh ideas when approaching information related to intelligence and security issues. This is particularly crucial now in the wake of theHamas attack on October 7that led to the massacre of 1,400 people in Israel.Liberman warned seven years ago that Hamas was building up capabilities and planning a surprise attack using hundreds of terrorists to try to kill and kidnap Israelis.At his office in the Knesset, the longtime leader of the Yisrael Beytenu party casts his gaze backward, then discusses the future.Liberman speaks clearly, with confidence and clarity. He wears a crisp white dress shirt. He understands politics and Israel, having been in these halls for decades. He has also worked closely with Benjamin Netanyahu since the 1990s.MK Avigdor Liberman attends a State Control Committee meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament in Jerusalem, on September 13, 2023. (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)In 2016, Liberman was defense minister. At the time, he saw information relating to Hamas threats.“I joined the Netanyahu-led government in May 2016; already by December 2016, I presented him with... I handed him a paper that I wrote with my advisers describing the scenario we saw on October 7, 2023. I also gave it to [IDF] chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot. I submitted this document to the cabinet in December 2016.”AdvertisementHe says, “My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite from that of our entire military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh approaches.”IN AN interview with theMagazine, Liberman does not dwell on the past, however. He wants a strong future for Israel, and he wants to see Hamas defeated, its leaders targeted, and Israel take back the initiative.He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions.

The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ At his office in the Knesset, the longtime leader of the Yisrael Beytenu party casts his gaze backward, then discusses the future.Liberman speaks clearly, with confidence and clarity. He wears a crisp white dress shirt. He understands politics and Israel, having been in these halls for decades. He has also worked closely with Benjamin Netanyahu since the 1990s.MK Avigdor Liberman attends a State Control Committee meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament in Jerusalem, on September 13, 2023. (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)In 2016, Liberman was defense minister. At the time, he saw information relating to Hamas threats.“I joined the Netanyahu-led government in May 2016; already by December 2016, I presented him with... I handed him a paper that I wrote with my advisers describing the scenario we saw on October 7, 2023. I also gave it to [IDF] chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot. I submitted this document to the cabinet in December 2016.”AdvertisementHe says, “My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite from that of our entire military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh approaches.”IN AN interview with theMagazine, Liberman does not dwell on the past, however. He wants a strong future for Israel, and he wants to see Hamas defeated, its leaders targeted, and Israel take back the initiative.He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign.

We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ In 2016, Liberman was defense minister. At the time, he saw information relating to Hamas threats.“I joined the Netanyahu-led government in May 2016; already by December 2016, I presented him with... I handed him a paper that I wrote with my advisers describing the scenario we saw on October 7, 2023. I also gave it to [IDF] chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot. I submitted this document to the cabinet in December 2016.”AdvertisementHe says, “My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite from that of our entire military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh approaches.”IN AN interview with theMagazine, Liberman does not dwell on the past, however. He wants a strong future for Israel, and he wants to see Hamas defeated, its leaders targeted, and Israel take back the initiative.He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others.

But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ He says, “My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite from that of our entire military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh approaches.”IN AN interview with theMagazine, Liberman does not dwell on the past, however. He wants a strong future for Israel, and he wants to see Hamas defeated, its leaders targeted, and Israel take back the initiative.He also wants to stress how important it is to ask the right questions and draw the right conclusions.“I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union.

He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ “I think it was clear to me that such a radical religious jihadist movement [Hamas] is a real threat to our future and existence – and in our 2009 coalition agreement, at our insistence, one of the main clauses was to eliminate Hamas’ rule in Gaza.” Hamas came to power in Gaza in the wake of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from theGaza Strip.Liberman opposed the disengagement and was dismissed from the cabinet by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon.Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners.

According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ Hamas came to power in Gaza and began firing rockets at Israel. It also attacked Israel in 2006, kidnapping Gilad Schalit that June. At the time, the saga of trying to get Schalit released was difficult for Israel.Yahya Sinwar – the terrorist leading Hamas in Gaza, who planned theOctober massacre– was released in 2011 in the Schalit deal. Liberman had opposed the release of the Hamas prisoners in the deal.By the time Liberman became defense minister, Israel had already entered into a kind of conception regarding Hamas rule in Gaza. Dividing the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza meant that Hamas would remain in Gaza. It received funds from Qatar and continued to attack Israel.There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat. More wars came and went, and Hamas rocket fire grew and the range of the rockets increased.“It was impossible to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the military and political leaders that Hamas was a real threat. There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility.

There was an arrogance and hubris... it was impossible [for them to see] that they had made a mistake and that someone had an opinion different to the official line. They were so arrogant, it was mission impossible to convince them,” recalls Liberman.IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ There was a war in 2009, and then an air campaign against Hamas in 2012, then a 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, designed to neutralize the Hamas tunnel threat.

According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ IT’S WORTH remembering now that back in 2016, Syria was in the midst of a civil war. Some of the arms flow for Hamas had been cut off when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in Egypt. In 2015, Egypt flooded tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt, which Hamas used for smuggling.At the time, Israel was focusing on threats in the North, including increased Iranian entrenchment in Syria.In November 2018, Hamas increased its attacks, launching 400 rockets at Israel in two days. Israel agreed to a ceasefire.“After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility.

He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ “After the Hamas attacks in November 2018, we had a cabinet meeting and I demanded a very tough response and wide operation against Hamas in Gaza,” recounts Liberman. “Of course, Netanyahu and Eizenkot preferred to do something in the North as an excuse not to do something in the South, and at the end of the day the final decision was a ceasefire.”He also says the decision was made to enable the transfer of $10 million in cash to Hamas in Gaza.“On November 14, I resigned from my position as defense minister, explaining that a ceasefire with Hamas and the decision to transfer the Qatari money to Hamas in Gaza were capitulations to terror. [I said at the time that] they were buying some quiet in the short term but sacrificing our security in the long term.”Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year. It was when Hamas launched massive riots along the border fence in the spring. US president Donald Trump opened the US Embassy in Jerusalem that May. In addition, 2018 was the year the Syrian regime returned to the Golan border and Iran began to increase its trafficking of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah.However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners. He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities].

He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ Unfortunately, Liberman says, the leadership ignored his warnings and Israel got momentary calm and quiet – but national security was sacrificed in the long term.His resignation in 2018 from Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition led to a shakeup of the political system.2018 was an important year.

He became finance minister.The government fell a year later, and Netanyahu returned to power.At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ However, Israel entered a political crisis in 2019 as elections were called.Over the next two years, there were numerous elections until Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett formed a government in 2021, with Liberman as one of their many coalition partners.

He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ At this point, Netanyahu embarked on a judicial reform crusade and extremist threats grew in the West Bank, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from Hamas in Gaza.What happened over the last weeks of September 2023 and the build-up to the October 7 attack?For about 12 days we watched the Hamas violence on our border, with some firing into our territory; shooting with guns; real violence on the fence. After 12 days, the decision was made to increase the number of workers permitted into Israel from Gaza from 18,000 to 30,000 and to increase monthly payments to Hamas from $10 to $18 million.For Hamas it was a signal; what they were doing was a dress rehearsal before they made the final decision to attack us. And this was an approach of capitulation, a defeatist approach to contain Hamas. Netanyahu’s approach was containment, and the result was that after their violence came the atrocities on October 7.You visited the Gaza periphery with Eshkol Regional Council head Gadi Yarkoni and saw a lack of IDF forces on the border, is that correct?I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities].

The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel. I visited our northern border, and I didn’t see the inhabitants of the 24 villages [because they are empty]... they will not return if they see Hezbollah terrorists on the border. They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees. Today, our society and landscape are more willing to accept my position than in the past. At the end of the day, they see I was right.LIBERMAN has always been a keen observer of the changing world order. He was born in Chisinau in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union. He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ I asked, ‘Where are the soldiers?’ We didn’t see any soldiers. We made a statement about this on video. I said in the video that it’s crazy what is happening here, we are in bad shape. Yarkoni said that during the 12 days [of Hamas’s agitation on the border], he didn’t receive any calls, either from the prime minister or from the defense minister to say anyone would visit them [the border communities]. Not a single MK visited the regional council on the Gaza periphery.LIBERMAN RECALLS giving interviews prior to the Friday before the attack. He even remembers comparing the situation to just before the Yom Kippur War, saying it was “worse.” That weekend was the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.We now know how lightly defended the Gaza border was.Hamas members on motorcycles and in trucks attacked the border in waves, hang-gliding into the Supernova festival. They struck at 29 points along the hi-tech border fence, attacking IDF posts and breaking through to the kibbutzim that line the border. Golani battalions on the border were overwhelmed and suffered heavy losses. Soldiers in observation posts had no defenses as they watched the enemy swarm over.When you were defense minister, how many battalions and defense forces were on the border?It was a really strong force. When they began with the riots [the so-called Great Return March, the Hamas-orchestrated riots in the spring of 2018], the reaction was tough. In Haaretz, Amos Harel wrote that we were seeing a different approach to everything. The mood for many years among our leadership – political and military leadership – was defeatist; everything [was aimed] at containment. They said Hamas had no interest in escalation.[Liberman provides an example from the week before October 7. He notes that at the Sunday meeting, a week before October 7, the security establishment and the prime minister all repeated “like parrots” the idea that Hamas was deterred and had no interest in escalation.]How could they come to such an erroneous conclusion?They were so self-confident and arrogant in their opinions. They tried to disregard the facts. [Liberman points out examples of when countries were surprised by invasion in the past such as before the Yom Kippur War, before World War II, before Operation Barbarossa – the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union – and before 9/11.] The world had enough intelligence [in each case].The question is what are your conclusions from the same information? My conclusion in 2016 was completely opposite to our whole military establishment, despite their experience and professionalism. When people serve many years in the same place, they don’t have the capacity for fresh perspectives.What would you have done differently on October 7?If I had been defense minister, on that day I would have submitted my resignation. It’s impossible not to take responsibility for this disaster... [the prime minister has tried to blame the protesters and others] but the trigger was his capitulation and defeatist position.What will Israel be like when the war is over?Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission.

In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North.

They saw what happened in the South. It’s impossible.We need the initiative in our hands. Not to contain. Rather, if there is one small violation, we should be very strong and ready to operate. And the response should be strong and aggressive.And what about Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis continue to attack us?We should respond in our own time. But it’s impossible not to react to this attack.And Gaza?It’s crucial to clarify from our side that we won’t supply any more electricity or water, and to close the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings. The crossings will be closed forever. What they need in Gaza will come from Egypt, through El Arish and Rafah. We made a very tough, disputed decision in 2005 for disengagement.Eliminate all their [Hamas] leaders [such as Mohammed Dief, Marwan Issa, and Yahya Sinwar]. Those in Qatar and Lebanon are legitimate targets. All of them, including Abu Marzouk, Sinwar, and all the others. We will never accept that [Hamas commander] Salah Arouri will operate from Beirut, for instance; it doesn’t matter where they are living today, they are legitimate targets.We should keep our options for freedom to operate there every day. It’s like in Judea and Samaria, when we think we should do something in Tulkarm or Jenin, we have our hands free to do it. The same should be done in the Gaza Strip. And create some buffer zone, around 2-3 k.m. along the border, and anyone who violates it should know they may be killed.What about the hostages being held in Gaza?We must make a decision to release all the hostages by force. I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately.

I don’t believe in deals with Hamas; they will cheat and claim some of the hostages are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and some in the hands of other groups... I’m not sure they are able to deliver. It’s our obligation to release all the hostages.If Israel leaves Gaza, though, after defeating Hamas and taking out its leaders, won’t Hamas return?I’m not sure. We should put pressure on the Arab League. Their 22 countries should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip. I’m not ready to take any responsibility.Qatar has backed Hamas. Could it swoop into Gaza?No. I think that the members of the moderate Arab states understand what Qatar intends. In Egypt, they don’t allow [Qatari news outlet] Al Jazeera. I’m not sure that Saudi Arabia or Jordan or others – or Kuwait – are so happy to see the Muslim Brotherhood in power. [Note: Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Qatar has backed groups linked to the Brotherhood.] It should be the responsibility of the Arab League, and we must be stubborn, and clear, and tough on this position. If not, there will be anarchy in Gaza.So what you propose is that Israel stop what you consider the policy of containment and capitulation.If we see new Hamas leaders, we should eliminate them with a free hand. If we see some new attempt to smuggle weapons or some attempt to create some new network of underground Gaza military positions, we should destroy it immediately. We should not tolerate 500 km. – or even 5 meters – of tunnels.The people of Kibbutz Kfar Aza used to help Gazans and embrace coexistence, yet after visiting the area where Hamas massacred and kidnapped many people, you said you believe that your view can now be embraced by those on the Left who might have opposed it.When I met them during our last meeting after October 7, they had shifted their views by 180 degrees.

He speaks Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, English, Hebrew, and other languages. As foreign minister, he promoted closer ties with African countries.What about Russia’s stance on Hamas, in which Moscow has not condemned the terrorism of October 7?For Russians, they have their interests and their main priority is the war in Ukraine, while we are part of the “West.” For them, it’s a global political interest; everything is related to their ties to Iran and North Korea; as with China and Taiwan.It’s a geopolitical situation. We are back to the Cold War. But even more bloodshed than during the Cold War.That could be bad news if countries like Russia refuse to condemn terror.They are afraid.The recent event in Dagestanwhere there was an attempt to lynch Jewish people and Israeli citizens – and it was a threat to the Jewish people and Israelis. They understand very well that the next step will be against Russians. Radical Islam is more popular in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the brainwashing that comes from abroad. It’s a huge challenge for Russia. ■ Israel will be a different country, although Netanyahu will try to survive [politically]; it’s his main strategy. There will be another attempt from Netanyahu to destroy our society.The first was to ignore the Hamas threat, the second was the legal reforms, and the third is the attempt to prevent the establishment of a commission of inquiry. He speaks [only] about a government commission. And he will try to survive and continue to be prime minister.LIBERMAN RECALLS how, in 2006 in the wake of the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu called on prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign. In January 2008, our own report in The Jerusalem Post noted that Netanyahu asserted, “Olmert refuses to take responsibility, to demonstrate personal honesty and leadership and to do what most of the public expect him to do,” adding that “the prime minister is emptying of content the concept of responsibility. The people of Israel know today that they are led by a prime minister who is not qualified or fit to lead them.”What about the other fronts Israel faces, such as constant attacks by Hezbollah, a terrorist group that doesn’t seem deterred?It’s terrible, but we have a very strong political card – the UN Security Council Resolution 1701... which was adopted by all members of the council, including China, Russia, and Qatar; and after them, the Lebanese government. According to the [resolution], it’s forbidden for even a single Hezbollah member to be stationed between the Litani River in Lebanon and our border, and presently we have thousands along our security fence on the northern border.We see the same pattern of behavior as in the South; they carry out provocations every day on our border, and I think that whatever you saw in the South, the writing was on the wall in the North. Hezbollah had been waiting for the best timing for their side. Today we have 200,000 refugees displaced within Israel.
