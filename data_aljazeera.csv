Is­rael-Hamas deal: What makes a truce lead to last­ing peace?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/israel-hamas-deal-what-makes-a-truce-lead-to-lasting-peace,"With Israel and Hamas agreeing to a four-day pause in fighting, here’s a look at how truces from other wars played out. After six weeks of war, Israel and Hamas have agreed to atemporary trucethat would pause fighting for four days and make way for an exchange of captives and prisoners. Since October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, Gaza has been devastated by bombardments of air and ground attacks that have left more than 14,000 Palestinians dead, mostly women and children. On Wednesday, Israel’s government agreed to a pause in fighting that could begin as soon as Friday. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that the truce is temporary and that the war will continue after it ends. However, there are numerous examples in the past century of truces that have been instrumental in ending wars – as well as many that didn’t. Here’s a look at truces from previous conflicts, what have we learned from them, and whether the pause between Israel and Hamas can lead to lasting peace.  Even small measures of trust and goodwill on both sides allow ceasefires to develop into lasting long-term peace, said Madhav Joshi, a research professor and associate director of the Peace Accords Matrix at the University of Notre Dame’s Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. With “a negotiated agreement between adversaries… where reforms are pursued across many different policy domains,” real peace may be the outcome, he said. Ethiopia – TPLF agreement (2022):Two years of fighting between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in the north of the country, and failed ceasefire attempts, led to the deaths of at least 100,000 people killed in the war by late 2022. But on November 2, 2022, the two sides signed the Pretoria Agreement, which halted the fighting between the Ethiopian government forces and the TPLF. Joshi told Al Jazeera that the Pretoria Agreement is an excellent example of how a pause in fighting can lead to peace. Yet what happened in Ethiopia goes far beyond what Israel and Hamas have agreed to. Their deal has no formal written text, no monitoring mechanism and includes no responsibility on either side to address the deeper root causes underlying their conflict. In Ethiopia, by contrast, both parties agreed to a permanent end to hostilities, on both sides, along with the disarmament of the TPLF and reintegration of the Tigrayan people. “While a larger peace process faces many obstacles, the agreement in Ethiopia includes a verification mechanism, a framework and commitment to address underlying political differences and matters arising out of the conflict. And in this case, that’s all that’s been necessary in finding a way towards peace,” he said. A year after the deal in Ethiopia,peace has largely held— even though much of Tigray remains devastated. Korean Armistice Agreement (1953):Technically, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) are still in a state of war since they never signed a peace deal after a bloody three-year war. South Korea was backed by the US in the war, and North Korea by communist China and the Soviet Union. An estimated 2 million people died, though some accounts suggest the death toll could have been as high as 5 million. Then, in July 1953, the fighting halted under an armistice agreement negotiated by the United States, United Nations and North Korea. South Korea’sthen-President Syngman Rheerefused to sign the agreement — he was insisting that his government be allowed to rule all of the Korean Peninsula. Still, the other actors involved agreed to “complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force until a final peaceful settlement is achieved”. They marked a 250km (155 miles) long and approximately 4km (2.5 miles) wide demilitarised zone between the two countries. Since then, despite frequent tensions between North and South Korea, the two have avoided a major military conflagration. Gulf War (1991):After 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990, the UN Security Council responded with a trade embargo and sanctions on Iraq. By January 1991, the US led an air and ground war ending with an Iraqi defeat and retreat from Kuwait in February 1991, with President George Bush declaring a ceasefire. Under the terms, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was not forced from power but was told to return land and property to Kuwait and recognise its sovereignty. Iraq was also ordered to get rid of all its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. This deal — which was unlike what Israel and Hamas have agreed to — ended the fighting between Iraq and Kuwait, but marked the beginning of Hussein’s downfall just over a decade later in 2003.  Sudan civil war 2023 – ongoing:In April, civil war broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the leader of the SAF, and his former deputy, the RSF’s General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, had once worked side by side in launching a military coup in 2021 after toppling the country’s longtime President Omar al-Bashir. But, both parties wanted to fill the power vacuum and lead the country. TheUS and Saudi Arabia have been mediatingbetween them for much of the year, but multiple ceasefire agreements to stop the fighting have failed, and violence has instead escalated across Sudan. In this case, both parties didn’t “refrain from seeking military advantage during the ceasefire”, as had been agreed by the terms of the agreements, and the war continues on today. Syrian Civil War, 2011 – ongoing:After Syrian pro-democracy activists led protests against PresidentBashar al-Assadin 2011, the Syrian regimeresponded by killing hundreds of demonstrators and imprisoning many more. Syria slid into war. Since then at least 230,224 civilians have died in the conflict and 140 ceasefire attempts have failed. Proposed internationally mediated ceasefires, with the UN, US and Russia stepping in, and more informal local ceasefire attempts, were only aimed at temporary cessations of hostilities for humanitarian relief to enter or for groups to rearm – limiting any chance of a suspension of violence. Research by the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) shows in 2016 there were a total of 43 ceasefires, but with each failed attempt violence escalated. In the years since, ceasefire deals decreased as did fighting. In 2020, just three ceasefires were declared. Faysal Itani, once a senior fellow for the Atlantic Council and now director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy,explainedin 2018 that the main cause of failed ceasefire attempts is the regime’s outlook on the war, namely, the fact that it does not recognise the legitimacy of any opposition that challenges its political monopoly over Syria. Six-Day War Ceasefire (1967):Israel, already occupying parts of Palestinian territory as prescribed by the UN in 1948, captured more — Gaza and the West Bank — as well as the Sinai from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria, in a war that lasted just six days. A UN Security Council ceasefire was initially rejected by both Egypt and Syria, but with Israeli forces rapidly expanding forces into their lands, they acquiesced and by the sixth day of conflict all parties accepted a truce. The ceasefire lasted for six years and by that measure, some believe it was a success. But it eventually fell apart after a peace agreement between Israel and neighbouring Arab states failed to agree upon Israel’s security and an end to the occupation of Palestinian lands. Joshi of the University of Notre Dame said the “narrow focus” of the current truce between Israel and Hamas, limited to “a pause in fighting and prisoner swap”, means it is “destined to fail”. If policy areas are left vague or untouched in peace agreements, as has been the case in previous rounds of Israel-Palestine talks, like the Oslo Accords and onwards – then there will always be the need for additional rounds of negotiations to enhance that agreement. “Either that or violence will resume,” Joshi said. “As the deal between Hamas and Israel is likely not to include further talks and monitoring and verification components, it is not likely to stop violence beyond the proposed four-day period,” he added. “It will not be surprising if the deal does fail outright.” Truces that have worked were either a result of final rounds of multiple earlier failed ceasefires, or from a ceasefire negotiated as part of a larger peace process. The inclusion of a verification and monitoring provision can also lead to successful peace deals. “A ceasefire deal will surely go wrong when one or both sides are still determined to defeat the other side militarily at the time of the ceasefire deal,” said Joshi. “There are plenty of examples of such failed ceasefires from Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, etc,” he added. Along with Michael J Quinn, also from the University of Notre Dame, Joshi hasresearched196 ceasefires and peace deals from 1975 – 2011, and found that “over 85 percent of them mostly fail – meaning a resumption of conflict”.",
Iran’s top diplo­mat dis­cuss­es Is­rael’s war in Gaza with Hezbol­lah leader,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/irans-top-diplomat-discusses-israels-war-in-gaza-with-hezbollah-leader,"Amirabdollahian warns ‘the scope of the war will expand’ if the Israel-Hamas truce does not hold. Iran’s top diplomat has met the leader of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah in an undisclosed location in Lebanon, discussing efforts to end Israel’s war in Gaza. The meeting of Iran’s Hossein Amirabdollahian and Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah as Israel and Palestinian group Hamas ready for an upcoming four-day humanitarian pause and a deal that is expected to free 50 Israelis held captive in Gaza and 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. The warring sides are stillhammering out the detailsof the Qatar-brokered deal, which Israel says will not take effect “before Friday”. Amirabdollahian, speaking to the Beirut-based Al Mayadeen channel on Wednesday, warned that if the ceasefire does not hold, “the scope of the war will expand”. Amirabdollahian left Beirut for Qatar’s capital Doha after meeting Nasrallah, Iran’s Nour news agency reported.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Hezbollah, a close ally of Iran, has repeatedly traded deadly cross-border fire with Israel since the start of the Gaza war on October 7, raising fears of a broader conflagration. Hezbollah said on Thursday morning that it fired 48 Katyusha rockets at an Israeli military base at Ein Zeitim, near the town of Safed about 10km (6 miles) from the border. The group said it also carried out at least 10 other attacks on Israeli positions near the frontier, which it claimed had caused casualties. The Israeli army hit several areas in southern Lebanon in retaliation, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency. Hezbollah says it has been acting in support of Hamas since the Palestinian group’s surprise October 7 incursion in southern Israel, which Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 people taken captive. Israel has promised to destroy Hamas and launched a relentless air and ground offensive on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 14,500 people, about 6,000 of them children, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The violence between Israel and Hezbollah has killed at least 108 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but also at least 14 civilians, including three journalists, the AFP news agency reported. Six Israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed on the Israeli side, according to the authorities.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Celtic fined over fans’ sup­port for Pales­tine dur­ing Cham­pi­ons League match,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/11/23/uefa-fines-celtic-over-palestine-support-israel-gaza-war-fans-defy-ban-pledge-support,"UEFA has fined the Scottish club after its fans waved thousands of Palestinian flags during the match against Atletico Madrid last month. Scotland’s Celtic Football Club has been fined $19,000 after itsfans waved Palestinian flagsduring a Champions League match against Atletico Madrid last month, UEFA has said. The match, which took place at the club’s home ground Celtic Park in Glasgow, saw thousands of fans wave the Palestine flag and display banners supporting the people of Gaza amid Israel’s war on the besieged strip. The governing body of football in Europe deemed the flags to be “provocative messages of an offensive nature” in a statement on Wednesday. Fans, who had been warned by the Scottish club not to display flags before the October 25 game, could be heard singing “You’ll Never Walk Alone” while holding the Palestinian flags in a video shared widely on social media. As kickoff neared, the stadium transformed into a sea of Palestinian flags, every stand awash with the colours of Palestine in a show of solidarity with those in Gaza under Israeli assault. Supporters also unfurled two large banners at Celtic Park that read “Free Palestine” and “Victory to the Resistance”. The main flag bearers, literally and figuratively, werethe Green Brigade– an “ultras” group formed in 2006, renowned for their Irish Republicanism and unflinching support for the Palestinian cause. Fearful of penalties, the club urged fans not to heed the Green Brigade’s call to show support for Palestine at the match, releasing a statement asking “that banners, flags and symbols relating to the conflict and those countries involved in it are not displayed at Celtic Park at this time”. A few days prior to the match, in an apparent warning to the group, Celtic banned the Green Brigade from all away games. Following the display against Atletico Madrid, that ban has been extended to all home games. In a letter to fans, the club outlined several reasons for the ban, including anti-social behaviour, the use of pyrotechnics and crucially “against Atletico Madrid, another unauthorised display, breaching the restrictions previously communicated”. The club was also fined $12,550 for fans blocking passageways and using pyrotechnics.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

For the Green Brigade, there is little doubt that it was the display of solidarity with Palestine which led to a ban on their attendance. “The other issues are a smokescreen,”the Green Brigade told Al Jazeera earlier this month. “The club are very clever and cynical. They want to sanction us, they want to punish us. They want to send us a message to try to keep us in line and deter us from doing further action. “But they know very well that on the issue of Palestine, they’re not on strong ground as they don’t have a lot of support amongst the wider fanbase on that issue. So they’re using other issues that they think they will have support on to sanction us.” The group said they were “unashamed of and unequivocal of our support for Palestine” and insisted that it will continue. “And once again the wider Celtic support showed that they too had the courage and conviction to stand and be counted. To side with the right side of history and voice support for the underdog, which in this case is the Palestinians.”  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

US war­ship cruis­ing Red Sea shoots down at­tack drones fired from Yemen,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/us-warship-cruising-red-sea-shoots-down-attack-drones-fired-from-yemen,"US assets in the Middle East have come under increasing threat since the war in Gaza broke out. A US warship cruising the Red Sea has shot down drones fired from Houthi-held territory in Yemen, according to the US Central Command. The USS Thomas Hudner, a guided-missile destroyer, shot down “multiple one-way attack drones” launched on Thursday morning from Yemen’s Houthi-controlled areas, CENTCOM said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. CENTCOM said there was no damage to the US vessel or injuries to its crew.  Yemen’s Houthi rebels have declared themselves part of the “axis of resistance” of Iran’s allies and launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel since the start of the war in Gaza. On Wednesday, Israel said it had intercepted a “cruise missile” heading for the south of the country, a shot claimed by the Houthi rebels. The spokesperson for the Houthis’ armed wing, Yahya Saree, said such operations would continue “until the Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank stops”. The Houthis have also threatened to target Israeli shipping over the country’s war with the Palestinian group Hamas that rules Gaza. On Sunday, the Houthisseizedan Israel-linked cargo vessel with an international crew of 25 at the entrance to the Red Sea. Israel’s military on Sunday said the seizure was a “very grave incident of global consequence”, and a US military official said it was “a flagrant violation of international law”. US assets in the Middle East have also come under fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7. US forces deployed in Iraq and Syria have been attacked at least 66 times during this time, causing injuries to more than 60 personnel, the Pentagon has said. On Wednesday, the USannouncedits first significant retaliatory strikes on Iran-backed armed groups targeting it in Iraq, striking several positions of the Kataib Hezbollah militia, also known as Hezbollah Brigades, south of Bagdad, killing at least eight fighters. Iraq’s government condemned the assault as an “unacceptable violation of Iraqi sovereignty”, saying the US had not coordinated with it in advance.",
Ex-Oba­ma ad­vis­er Stu­art Sel­dowitz ar­rest­ed af­ter Is­lam­o­pho­bic rant,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/ex-obama-adviser-stuart-seldowitz-arrested-after-islamophobic-rant,"The former State Department official was filmed harassing a Muslim street vendor in New York, saying more Palestinian children should be killed in Gaza. A former high-ranking US government official has been arrested after being captured on video calling a halal food vendor in New York City a“terrorist”and saying the death of 4,000 Palestinian children in Gaza “wasn’t enough”. Stuart Seldowitz, 64, who previously served as deputy director of the US State Department’s Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs, was arrested on Wednesday on charges of aggravated harassment, hate crime stalking, stalking causing fear, and stalking at a place of employment, New York police said in a statement. “A 24-year-old male victim stated to police that an individual approached him at his work place multiple times and made anti-Islamic statements multiple times on different dates causing the victim to feel afraid and annoyed,” police said. Video went viral this month of multiple arguments over Israel’s war on Gaza between Seldowitz and an Egyptian man working in a halal cart in Manhattan. “If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids, it wasn’t enough,” Seldowitz says in one exchange captured on video and posted on the social media platform X. The vendor is seen telling Seldowitz to “go, go, go, go” and “I won’t hear it”. Seldowitz then responds: “But you’re a terrorist. You support terrorism.”  In other exchanges, Seldowitz is heard casting slurs against Prophet Muhammad, and calling the vendor “ignorant” for his lack of fluency in English. Seldowitz also threatens to use his government connections to mobilise Egypt’s secret police against the vendor. “The Mukhabarat [the intelligence agency] in Egypt will get your parents. Does your father like his fingernails? They’ll take them out one by one,” he says smiling. Seldowitz served as the acting director for the National Security Council South Asia Directorate under the former President Barack Obama administration. He also worked as a senior political officer in the State Department’s Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs. Seldowitz told local television news before his detention on Wednesday that the video posted on social media failed to tell the whole story and that he became upset after the man expressed sympathies for the Palestinian group Hamas – although none of the videos shows the vendor mentioning the group that rules Gaza. “The comments that went beyond him [the vendor], and could be interpreted as attacks on Muslims and Arab-Americans and so on, were probably not appropriate,” he told WNBC television. “The comments I made calling him out for his support of terrorism – those I think were appropriate.” After Seldowitz’s actions went viral, New Yorkers rallied to support the vendor, lining up to buy chicken and rice at the food cart in Manhattan’s Upper East Side neighbourhood on Tuesday. The Street Vendor Project, which works with the thousands of food carts in New York, described a “moving scene” with New Yorkers from “all walks of life coming together” and “taking a stand against anti-Muslim hate”.  On October 7, Hamas launched an attack in Israel that killed 1,200 people. Israel has since bombarded the Gaza Strip, killing more than 14,500 Palestinians. In the US, the war has prompted a surge in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and fuelled frequent street protests in support of both Israel and Palestine. Asked about the incident by the Reuters news agency, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said: “The United States unequivocally opposes racist or discriminatory language of any form.”  This is a modal window.

"Is­raeli army ar­rests al-Shi­fa Hos­pi­tal di­rec­tor, oth­er doc­tors in Gaza",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/al-shifa-hospital-director-arrested-by-israeli-army-in-gaza,"Director Muhammad Abu Salmiya and several other medical personnel detained as Israel continues its Gaza offensive. The Israeli army has arrested the director of al-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical complex in the Gaza Strip, according to a doctor and media reports. Muhammad Abu Salmiya was arrested along with several other “senior doctors”, Khalid Abu Samra, a department chief at the hospital, told the AFP news agency on Thursday. The arrest was also reported by the Israeli Broadcasting Authority, and was confirmed in a post on the social media platform X by Salmiya’scousin, Adham Abu Selmiya. Gaza’s ministry of health said it wants an explanation from the World Health Organization, as medics were travelling in a WHO convoy with patients when they were stopped and detained by Israeli forces. “The World Health Organization has not yet sent us any report to explain the situation including the numbers and names of those detained,” said Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the health ministry. “The inability to contact al-Shifa means we don’t know who has bee arrested … There’s a chance some of those detainees will be killed. We know the occupation forces are capable of that.” He said the ministry has decided to stop coordination with the WHO regarding evacuations until they send them a report explaining what happened.

In a statement, Hamas said it “strongly denounces” the arrest of Salmiya and his colleagues, calling on the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organisations to work towards their “immediate release”. Days before the arrests, “two Palestinian paramedics had been arrested by the Israeli occupation forces”, said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from southern Gaza on Thursday. “This gives a clear sign that there is no immunity inside the Gaza Strip, neither for medical workers, civil defence crews or even journalists, as the attacks have reached all classes in the Palestinian community.” Al-Shifa Hospital has been amajor focusof Israel’s ground offensive in northern Gaza. The army ordered anevacuationof the facility on Saturday, but the handful of staff remaining there say there are about 180 patients still inside. The Israeli army, which raided the hospital last week, allege that Hamas fighters used a tunnel complex beneath the facility in Gaza City to stage attacks. Hamas and hospital officials have repeatedly denied the claims. Meanwhile on Thursday, Munir al-Bursh, the director-general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, said the Israeli army gave people in the Indonesian Hospital just hours to evacuate the facility in northern Gaza. He said there are about 200 patients left at the hospital after some 450 patients were evacuated yesterday, and he told Al Jazeera that bombing continues from all sides in the vicinity. “This hospital is considered to be the main central hospital that is still operating in the north of the Gaza Strip, alongside another two central hospitals,” Al Jazeera’s Abu Azzoum said, adding that there are patients, medical workers and displaced people inside. “Both hospitals [al-Shifa and the Indonesian hospital] are witnessing a very serious and even critical condition as the Israeli troops are still encircling and even exerting significant control,” our correspondent said. On Wednesday, the UN’s humanitarian office said the Israeli army “obstructed” a convoy of ambulances transporting 190 wounded and sick patients from al-Shifa Hospital to the south, resulting in the journey taking almost 20 hours. The lengthy delay at the Israeli military checkpoint dividing north and south Gaza put “the lives of the wounded and sick people in danger”, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). The medical service has earlier said that 14 of its ambulances, two UN buses and other vehicles were involved in the evacuation of the patients, as well as “a number of medical teams” from al-Shifa Hospital. The PRCS said three paramedics and a companion of one of the wounded patients were detained for more than three hours in the cold, while the patients were transferred to hospitals in the south.

"As Is­rael pounds Gaza, BBC jour­nal­ists ac­cuse broad­cast­er of bias",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/as-israel-pounds-gaza-bbc-journalists-accuse-broadcaster-of-bias,"In the latest newsroom fallout over the war, BBC journalists say the corporation is failing to humanise Palestinians. London, United Kingdom –The BBC has been accused by its journalists of failing to tell the story of the Israel-Palestine conflict accurately, investing greater effort in humanising Israeli victims compared with Palestinians, and omitting key historical context in coverage. In a 2,300-word letter written to Al Jazeera by eight UK-based journalists employed by the corporation, the BBC is also said to be guilty of a “double standard in how civilians are seen”, given that it is “unflinching” in its reporting of alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Fearing reprisal, the journalists requested anonymity. The group does not plan to send the letter to BBC executives, believing such a move was unlikely to lead to meaningful discussions. They sent Al Jazeera the letter as a humanitarian disaster in Gaza escalates, and as grim milestones are reached at pace. At the time of writing, more than 14,500 Palestinians have been reported askilledby Israeli bombardment, including at least 6,000 children. “The BBC has failed to accurately tell this story – through omission and lack of critical engagement with Israel’s claims – and it has therefore failed to help the public engage with and understand the human rights abuses unfolding in Gaza,” the letter reads. “Thousands of Palestinians have been killed since October 7. When will the number be high enough for our editorial stance to change?” Israel declared war againstHamasafter the Palestinian group, which governs the densely populated enclave, attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostage. Rights groups and hundreds of thousands ofprotesters worldwide, outraged by the soaring Palestinian death toll in Gaza, have called for a ceasefire. The war has also divided newsrooms globally, with disagreements over how each side is being portrayed, the allegedly unequal level of empathy shown to Israeli and Palestinian victims, and the use of language. The BBC journalists said that across British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) platforms, terms like “massacre” and “atrocity”, have been reserved “only for Hamas, framing the group as the only instigator and perpetrator of violence in the region. This is inaccurate but aligns with the BBC’s overall coverage”. The Hamas assault, while “appalling and devastating … does not justify the indiscriminate killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians, and the BBC cannot be seen to support – or fail to interrogate – the logic that it does,” their letter reads. “We are asking the BBC to better reflect and defer to the evidence-based findings of official and unbiased humanitarian organisations.” The journalists appealed to the corporation to “ensure that the equal treatment of all civilians is at the heart of its coverage”. They claimed that the broadcaster carefully portrays Israeli suffering by, for instance, telling audiences the names of victims, covering individual funerals, and interviewing affected families. “In comparison, humanising coverage of Palestinian civilians has been lacking. It is a poor excuse to say that the BBC could not better cover stories in Gaza because of difficulties gaining access to the [Gaza] Strip … This is achieved, for example, by telling and following individual stories across weeks. Little attempt has also been made to fully utilise the abundance of social media content from brave journalists in Gaza and the West Bank.” The journalists acknowledged “some strong isolated examples”, but said sensitively told stories about Palestinians were not “consistent”, particularly after the outbreak of war. “It is largely in the last few weeks – as civilian deaths have exponentially increased and Western countries’ appetite for Israel’s attacks has waned – that the BBC has made more effort to humanise Palestinian civilians. For many, this feels too little too late, and shows that the positions taken by governments in the UK and US have undue influence on coverage.” Al Jazeera interviewed two of the eight co-writers. Some of those behind the letter are people of colour. “This organisation doesn’t represent us,” one of the co-writers told Al Jazeera. “For me, and definitely for other people of colour, we can see blatantly that certain civilian lives are considered more worthy than others – that there is some sort of hierarchy at play. That is deeply, deeply hurtful because actually, none of us struggle to empathise with Palestinian civilians.” The journalist said that to them, it appears some staff members and senior reporters “don’t empathise as much with [Palestinians], as they do, for example, with Ukrainian civilians”. The second co-writer Al Jazeera interviewed said they felt “sickened by the senseless loss of civilian life” during the Hamas attacks. “I also felt a number of overlapping fears [including] that the coverage of my employer, the BBC, would fail in its duty to sufficiently interrogate this [Israeli] response or provide adequate context on decades of occupation.” “My fears were immediately confirmed.” The letter says that the BBC has organised “trauma support and listening sessions” for staff affected by the conflict. “But for many of us – especially people of colour – the BBC’s coverage has been part of our distress,” the letter says.

Further critiquing the BBC’s storytelling, the journalists argue that while Palestinians have been asked whether they “condemn Hamas”, the same cannot be said for guests who defend Israel’s actions. “[They] are not equally asked to ‘condemn’ the actions of the Israeli government, however high the civilian death toll in Gaza.” On October 9, the BBC was criticised as lacking compassion over its interview with Husam Zomlot, the head of the Palestinian Mission to the United Kingdom, who lost several members of his family during the early days of Israel’s bombing campaign. Zomlot, who does not represent Hamas, told presenter Kirsty Wark of his emotional pain. He listed the relatives who had been killed, describing them as “sitting ducks for the Israeli war machine”. Wark replied: “I am sorry for your own personal loss. I mean, can I just be clear though, you cannot condone the killing of civilians in Israel, can you? Nor the killing of families?” Zomlot, taken aback, then said: “No we don’t condone, no we don’t.”  The letter also claims that the BBC is failing to provide audiences with important background about Israel’s occupation and the history of Palestinian suffering. “For Israel’s bombardment to be considered ‘self-defence’, events must begin with the Hamas-led attack,” they said. “News updates and articles neglect to include a line or two of critical historical context – on 75 years of occupation, the Nakba, or the asymmetric death toll across decades.” The Nakba, or catastrophe, refers to the displacement and dispossession of Palestinians between 1947 and 1949, when Zionist paramilitaries and then Israel’s newly formed army destroyed more than 500 Palestinian villages and towns. About 15,000 Palestinians were killed, and more than 750,000 were forcibly displaced from their land. Today’s crisis evokes memories of the Nakba for Palestinians in Gaza, many of whom are descendants of those who were uprooted decades ago. “The BBC has often called the ongoing conflict ‘complex’. It is no more complex than any other conflict,” the letter reads. “It is our job to cut through rhetoric and misinformation; to explain what is happening and what has led to this.” A BBC spokesperson denied the allegations. In an email sent to Al Jazeera, the spokesperson said: “Throughout our reporting on the conflict the BBC has made clear the devastating human cost to civilians living in Gaza and Israel.” They added that the BBC is “one of the only news organisations” to have journalists inside Gaza, who have been able to provide “on the ground reporting”. “This has included many stories of Palestinian victims and first-hand testimony from civilians, doctors and aid-workers in Gaza, as well as a Panorama documentary, featuring human stories from both sides,” they said. “When interviewing either the Israeli government, Hamas, Palestinian representatives, or other leaders, we are robust, challenging and aim to hold power to account.” The spokesperson also sent a list of examples of BBC coverage on the war, which included human stories of Palestinian suffering. One linked to a documentary on October 23, with the summary: “Panorama reports on the conflict between Israel and Hamas. After 1,400 Israelis, including women and children were murdered by Hamas fighters, Israel promised brutal retaliation to destroy Hamas. More than three thousand Palestinians, many women and children, have already been killed in Gaza. Reporter Jane Corbin hears the human stories on both sides and asks what does the escalating crisis mean for the wider region?” Israel has sincerevised downthe death toll from 1,400 to 1,200. The summary is an example of the kind of language in Western media outlets that many have criticised; Israelis are described as being “murdered by Hamas fighters”, but Palestinians are “killed” by a nameless actor. Since the latest Middle East conflict began, the BBC has been beset by controversies and claims of bias. Last month, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the broadcaster’s descriptions of Hamas fighters as “militants”, rather than “terrorists”, was “verging on disgraceful”. Hamas is designated as a “terror” group by the UK, United States and European Union. At around the same time, the protest group Palestine Action claimed responsibility for vandalising the network’s London headquarters with red paint, accusing it of “spreading the occupation’s lies and manufacturing consent for Israel’s war crimes”. Last week, the BBC embedded with the Israeli army to be shown around al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, after Israel took control of the site. Israel has alleged that Hamas operated from the hospital – claims that many observers, including the BBC, have questioned. Stephen Grey, a Reuters reporter, said on X of the trip facilitated by Israel: “Media should think very carefully about taking part in any one-sided embeds with any party. Today’s BBC report on al Shifa hospital, in which they were unable to speak to doctors or patients, left me feeling deeply uncomfortable.” On October 24, a BBC correspondent based in Beirut, Rami Ruhayem, wrote to Tim Davie, BBC’s director-general, alleging that there are “indications that the BBC is – implicitly at least – treating Israeli lives as more worthy than Palestinian lives, and reinforcing Israeli war propaganda”. On October 25, The Times newspaper, citing a BBC source, reported that staff had been “crying in the toilets” over the “distress caused” by coverage that they alleged was too lenient on Israel. And over the weekend, Danny Cohen, a former director of BBC Television, said the corporation should be independently investigated over “management failures in its reporting of Israel”, as he accused a BBC journalist of pro-Palestine bias on her social media feed. The war has led to bitter divides across other newsrooms, too. An unnamed reporter at The Guardian, with family in southern Israel, wrote in the Jewish News that they felt disillusioned by the newspaper’s coverage and working environment after the Hamas attacks, claiming their colleagues were unsupportive. “I think that Israel must defend itself. Yet when I say this, people will tell me I am justifying the murder of children. They will tell me it is a genocide,” they wrote. Anne Boyer, a poetry editor for The New York Times, quit last week, ostensibly over the paper’s editorial stance. Apparently taking aim at the newspaper’s language on the war, she said: “I can’t write about poetry amidst the ‘reasonable’ tones of those who aim to acclimatize us to this unreasonable suffering. No more ghoulish euphemisms. No more verbally sanitized hellscapes. No more warmongering lies.” Jazmine Hughes, a writer for The New York Times, resigned after signing a solidarity statement that described “Gaza’s people” as “victims of a genocidal war”. Journalist and illustrator Mona Chalabi, who works for The Guardian US and freelances for The New York Times, posted on Instagram on October 18 that The New York Times has “consistently mentioned Israeli deaths more often than Palestinian deaths. What’s more, their coverage of Israeli deaths is *increasing* as more Palestinians are dying”. Meanwhile, at the Los Angeles Times, staffers who signed a protest letter in solidarity with journalists in Gaza have been blocked from covering the war for three months, Semafor reported. According to the BBC’s rules on impartiality, editorial staff “should not participate in public demonstrations or gatherings about controversial issues”.",
Pho­tos: Is­rael steps up at­tacks on Gaza be­fore truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/23/photos-israel-steps-up-attacks-gaza-attacks-ahead-of-truce,"In Pictures Israel has continued its attacks on Gaza in advance of an agreed truce with Hamas, killing dozens of Palestinians across the bombarded territory. The relentless raids on Wednesday dimmed hopes that the expected four-day pause would lead to a permanent ceasefire. “The ongoing mass bombardment of the Gaza Strip keeps creating tragedies and misery for Palestinians,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis. Three attacks in northern Gaza killed dozens of people, includingentire families. There were also deadly air raids in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, including a building that houses a charity next to the Kuwait Speciality Hospital in Rafah. Southern Gaza has been designated as a supposedly safe area by the Israeli army, but its continuous bombardment there means that the area is “equally dangerous” to the north and “people are equally at risk of losing their life”, Mahmoud said. In central Gaza, Israeli forces hit residential buildings in Deir el-Balah and the Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa, sparking fears of multiple deaths and injuries. Meanwhile, Israeli forces continued raiding towns across the occupied West Bank. In one such incident, six Palestinians were shot dead in Tulkarem, the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Health said.",
"Is­rael says truce, cap­tives re­lease will not start ‘be­fore Fri­day’",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/israel-says-truce-captives-release-will-not-start-before-friday,"Senior official says negotiations on how to handle the exchange of captives are continuing. A temporary truce and the release of dozens of captives taken by Palestinian armed group Hamas in its assault on Israel on October 7 will not start before Friday, Tel Aviv has said, as Israeli forces continued to bombard the besieged enclave of Gaza. The release is part of atemporary truce, initially expected to last four days, that was agreed by Israel and Hamas on Wednesday and also includes the deployment of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza. The captives are supposed to be exchanged for a number of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. “The negotiations on the release of our hostages are advancing and continuing constantly,” Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said in a statement released by the prime minister’s office. “The start of the release will take place according to the original agreement between the sides, and not before Friday,” it said. Israel’s public broadcaster Kan, quoting an unidentified Israeli official, reported there was a 24-hour delay because the agreement had not been signed by Hamas and Qatar, which was the key mediator in the deal. The official said they were optimistic the agreement would be carried out when it was signed. “No one said there would be a release tomorrow except the media … We had to make it clear that no release is planned before Friday, because of the uncertainty that hostages’ families are facing,” Kan quoted an unnamed source in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office as saying. Other Israeli media published similar reports, quoting anonymous officials, that the pause in fighting with Hamas would not start before Friday. More than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began itsattackson the territory in response to Hamas’s assault on Israel that left at least 1,200 people dead. About 240 people were taken by Hamas fighters, and only four have been released so far. There were about 5,200 Palestinians in Israeli prisons prior to October 7, although that number has more thandoubledin the weeks since, according to Palestinian authorities. Amid the apparent delay to the truce agreement, Israeli aircraft and artillery struck Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis in at least two waves early on Thursday. In Israel, sirens warning of incoming rocket fire from Gaza blared in communities near the border with the enclave, the military said. There were no reports of damage or injuries. Tensions also rose on Israel’s northern border early on Thursday after the Iran-backed Hezbollah group said five of its fighters, including the son of a senior lawmaker, had been killed. In the Red Sea, meanwhile, US Central Command said the USS Thomas Hudner had “shot down multiple one-way attack drones launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen”, referencing another Iran-backed group. The delay caused frustration among families on both sides. Under the terms of the agreement, 50 Hamas captives are due to be released, with a minimum of 10 being freed each day. “We don’t know who will get out because Hamas will release the names every evening of those who will get out the next day,” said Gilad Korngold, who was still awaiting word of relatives. Seven of his family members, including his three-year-old granddaughter, were kidnapped by Hamas. “I want everybody back. But I think – and it’s a very tough decision – but I think the children and women must be [first]. They are most fragile. You know, they need to get out.” Netanyahu’s office has said thetrucecould be extended as long as an additional 10 hostages were freed each day. On Israel’s list of 300 eligible Palestinian prisoners of 123 children and 33 women is Shorouq Dwayyat, who is serving a 16-year sentence for attempted murder in a 2015 knife attack. Campaigners say she is one of many Palestinians to have been unjustly tried and sentenced on unfair or fabricated charges. “I had hoped that she would come out in a deal,” her mother,Sameera Dwayyat, said but added that her relief was tempered by “great pain in my heart” over the dead children in Gaza. The US also hoped that aid would begin reaching Gaza in large volumes in the coming days, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. Hamassaidthe initial 50 captives would be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children imprisoned in Israel. Hundreds of trucks of humanitarian, medical and fuel supplies would enter Gaza, while Israel would halt all air sorties over southern Gaza and maintain a daily six-hour daytime no-fly window in the north, it added. The truce agreement, the first in a nearly seven-week-long war, was reached after mediation by Qatar and seen by governments around the world as potentially easing the suffering in the Gaza Strip, which is home to more than two million people. In a statement shared by US media outlets, National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson stressed the deal “was agreed and remains agreed”. “The parties are working out final logistical details, particularly for the first day of implementation,” CBS News and CNN reported Watson as saying. “It is our view that nothing should be left to chance as the hostages begin coming home. Our primary objective is to ensure that they are brought home safely. That is on track, and we are hopeful that implementation will begin on Friday morning.”",
‘Can re­gain our soul’: Re­lief and fear in Gaza ahead of Is­rael truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/23/can-regain-our-soul-relief-and-fear-in-gaza-ahead-of-israel-truce,"Some hope to find missing loved ones, return home and grieve for killed relatives. Others just want to get some sleep. Deir el-Balah and Fukhari, Gaza Strip —After more than six weeks of war, Khaled Loz knows what he wants to do when the truce announced on Wednesday by Israel and Hamas finally comes into effect. He wants to sleep. “It’s the first thing I want to do. I’m tired of all the continuous bombing,” he says. Since the attack by Hamas fighters on southern Israel on October 7, in which they killed 1,200 people, Israeli aerial bombing and artillery shelling has killedmore than 14,000 Palestiniansin Gaza, including more than 5,600 children. An estimated 1.7 million people out of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have been displaced, with many moving from the northern part of the Gaza Strip to the south following warnings from the Israeli military. But Israel’s bombing has extended to central andsouthern Gazatoo, leaving no part of the enclave safe, with refugee camps, schools and hospitals also attacked. Now, the declaration of a four-day truce that could come into effect soon is promising the first hope of some respite for Gaza’s people. “We can regain our soul a little,” says Loz. “We want to provide water for our homes, we want goods to enter instead of empty shops where we cannot find what we need.” But it is also the first opportunity for thousands of families to finally grieve loved ones lost in the bombing. Others are hoping that the pause in fighting allows them to search for missing relatives and friends. Loz says the home of his mother’s family in Gaza City was bombed. “I don’t know who is left of them, and I don’t know who was martyred. I want to check on my uncle,” he says. “Where are they, where have they fled to?” “We want to grieve for those we lost. They [Israel] did not give us a chance to express our feelings, even to cry for our friends.” According to Hamas, the truce will enable the free movement of people from the north of Gaza to the south along Salah al-Din Road, the territory’s main highway. But there is no such guarantee of movement towards the north, where Gaza City is based, so it is unclear whether those like Loz who want to search for missing relatives in the north will be able to make their way there. Etaf Hussien Musataf al-Jamalan, a father of five children, was displaced fromSheikh Radwan, a district of Gaza City, and was hoping to return to check on his house during the pause in fighting. He says he has “mixed feelings” about the truce. “We wanted to check our houses. Maybe grab some supplies or anything,” he says, adding that he is “sad” that the truce terms might not allow that. He doesn’t know if his house is still standing — the United Nations estimates that half of north Gaza’s homes have been damaged or destroyed in the bombing — but he says he would prefer to “live in a tent in our neighbourhood” than as a displaced person. Enas al-Jamalah, 12, is also from Sheikh Radwan. Displaced to Deir el-Balah, he and thousands of others sleep outdoors as winter sneaks up on Gaza, with temperatures dropping at night to 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit). His reason to go back home — if it still stands — is simple. “We just want to be warm,” he says. That longing for home pulls at Fatima Qudayh, too. The 37-year-old from the town of Khuza’a fled to nearby Khan Younis in southern Gaza two days into the war. Her home in Khuza’a had been damaged in the 2021 war, but she and her family had lovingly rebuilt it. Now, she doesn’t know if it’s still fine, damaged or destroyed. She hopes to visit once the truce comes into effect. Her six children have barely slept since the war started, she says. “Every night, there is bombing everywhere. Every day, they ask me about the house. Is it OK? Are theirtoys OKand their rooms OK?” “I tell them I pray that they are OK — but that the most important thing is that you are OK.”",
‘Im­por­tant but not enough’: What does Is­rael-Hamas deal mean for US pol­i­cy?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/important-but-not-enough-what-does-israel-hamas-deal-mean-for-us-policy,"Advocates pledge to continue to push for ceasefire as Biden welcomes captives deal that will see temporary pause to war. Washington, DC –The agreement between Israel and Hamas to pause the fighting in Gaza and release dozens of captives highlights the power of diplomacy and creates an opening to endthe violence, advocates in the United States say. But they stress that the truce is not sufficient, with many pledging to continue pressuring the administration of US President Joe Biden topursue a long-term ceasefire. “This is an important break in the fighting. It’s important that these families are reunified,” said Hassan El-Tayyab, legislative director for Middle East policy at the advocacy group Friends Committee on National Legislation. “But it’s not enough. We have to continue building momentum to reach a permanent ceasefire, a return of all the hostages, unfettered aid access and a solution for peace for Israelis and Palestinians.” The dealwill see Hamasrelease 50 women and children held in Gaza, and Israel free 150 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. The exchange will be accompanied by a four-day pause in the fighting and an increased delivery of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian territory. The agreement, which was approved by the Israeli government late on Tuesday, is expected to go into effect on Friday. It will mark the first stop in the fighting since the war broke out.

Israel has pledged to continue its military campaign after the pause. But El-Tayyab stressed that “more war” is not the answer, and that there is no military solution to the crisis. “The question is: Will we fall back to where we were for the past six weeks, with indiscriminate bombing and civilians dying and the hostages being held?” he told Al Jazeera. “Or are we going to take a step forward towards more negotiations, an extended truce, to get everybody home and finally resolve some of the underlying issues that are creating the cycles of violence, which includethe systemic oppressionof Palestinians?” PresidentBidenwelcomed the deal and thanked Qatar and Egypt for helping to broker it. He also applauded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in astatementon Wednesday. “I appreciate the commitment that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government have made in supporting an extended pause to ensure this deal can be fully carried out and to ensure the provision of additional humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of innocent Palestinian families in Gaza,” Biden said. He did not comment on the future of the conflict. The Biden administration has been calling for “humanitarian pauses” in the war while firmly rejecting demands for a ceasefire, at least until Israel achieves its stated goal of eliminating Hamas. A truce or a pause is a temporary halt of fighting for an agreed-upon period of time — in this case, four days. A ceasefire is an indefinite end to hostilities that often comes with a negotiated agreement between the warring parties. Nancy Okail, president of the Center for International Policy, a US-based think tank, called the truce a “step in the right direction”. She said the pause could be used todeliver aidto Palestinians in Gaza, push for a lasting ceasefire and ensure the safety of humanitarian workers, medics and journalists. “This would be important not just for the immediate objective of helping secure the release of the hostages but also to save lives and stop the bloodshed,” Okail told Al Jazeera.

More than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in response to the October 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 Israelis. Hamas also took more than 200 people captive from Israel. Thousands of Palestinians are in Israeli jails, including hundreds of children, many of whom are held in so-calledadministrative detentionwithout formal charges. The scale of the violence in Gaza has prompted many scholars and United Nations experts to warn of the risk of genocide. The Israeli army has forcibly displaced most of the population in the north of the territory — more than one million residents — raising concerns about the possibleethnic cleansingof Palestinians, especially if they are not allowed to return to their homes. Okail said the halt in violence should extend to the West Bank, where more than 200 Palestinians havebeen killedby Israeli forces and settlers since October 7. If the fighting resumes, Okail also explained that she would like to see the US take a firm stance against any war crimes, including the use of collective punishment, civilian hostages and indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas. “The Biden administration should also draw a clear red line around the use of US-supplied arms and make clear that there will be consequences if those weapons are not used in accordance with international law,” Okail added. The White House and Pentagon have repeatedly said that they would not draw any “red lines” to restrict the Israeli operation in Gaza and how American arms are used. Israel receives $3.8bn in US aid annually. Biden is seeking more than $14bn inadditional assistancefor Israel this year. Leading rights groups like Amnesty International, however, have accused Israel of imposing apartheid on Palestinians. But the appeals for Biden to rein in Israeli abuses appear to be going unheard. Politicoreportedlate on Tuesday that the Biden administration is concerned that the pause “would allow journalists broader access to Gaza and the opportunity to further illuminate the devastation there and turn public opinion on Israel”. Against that backdrop, El-Tayyab called for independent observers to assess the carnage of Gaza. “We need to allow the truth to come out. If the truth leads the public to say: This is a war we don’t want to be a part of, then we have to let the chips fall where they may,” he told Al Jazeera.  This is a modal window.

This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  Rights advocates have also expressed fear that renewed bombing after the truce might target southern Gaza, which has becomemore densely populatedsince the start of the war, as families flee bombings and other attacks. But Biden’s support for Israel is not expected to waver after the pause. ​​Juan Cole, professor of history at the University of Michigan, said Biden’s green light for the war is one of the main reasons the Israeli campaign “has gone on for this unspeakably long period”. “My reading of the Netanyahu government is that they’re incorrigible, that nothing would stand in their way if they want to start back up the destruction,” Cole told Al Jazeera. “And thenPresident Bidenhas shown himself to have no backbone whatsoever when trying to stand up to Netanyahu.” Cole noted that Netanyahu has been under pressure from the captives’ families to accept the deal, despite opposition from his far-right political allies. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, for instance, called the agreement “immoral”. Despite the push in some right-wing circles for the relentless bombing to continue, Israel does not appear close to destroying Hamas. The Palestinian group continues to fight Israeli troops in northern Gaza, killing dozens of soldiers since the ground invasion began. Hamas’s top political and military leadership remains intact as well. It’s not clear how and if Israel can eliminateHamas militarilyand what would come after the group if it were destroyed. Hamas has controlled Gaza since 2007. That’s why many progressive activists in the US are urging a political solution to end the violence — one that goes beyond the current deal.

Usamah Andrabi, communications director at Justice Democrats, a progressive group, called for the US to end its unconditional support for the Israeli government that “continues to openly tell us its plans to annihilateand displacethe Palestinian people”. Andrabi said the pause is a temporary but necessary reprieve from the “incessant bombing and destruction by the Israeli government”, which will allow for the release of captives. “But we cannot let up on our demands for a permanent ceasefire,” Andrabi told Al Jazeera. Sandra Tamari, the executive director of Adalah Justice Project, an advocacy group, echoed Andrabi’s comments. She said the halt is simply a “pause of genocide”. “How can we settle for a pause to that kind of violence? We have to continue to push the US government to call for a complete ceasefire,” Tamari told Al Jazeera.",
Is­rael drops hun­dreds of bombs on Gaza ahead of ex­pect­ed truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/23/israel-hamas-war-live-israel-pounds-gaza-ahead-of-expected-truce,"A Palestinian activist has shared a heart-warming video capturing the efforts of fellow activists aiming to entertain displaced children sheltering in schools in southern Gaza. “From the midst of pain, we make hope with the smile of our children,” he says. Watch the video below:  A spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry says the truce deal should go ahead “without further delay”. Anne-Claire Legendre said the French government was also urging “the immediate release of all hostages”. “We call for the terms of this agreement to be fully respected,” she added. The Israeli army says the director of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, Muhammad Abu Salmiya, was arrested and transferred to the Israeli Securities Authority (ISA) for questioning following “evidence showing that the hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre”. “After the Hamas massacre on October 7, Hamas terrorists sought refuge within the hospital, some of them taking hostage from Israel with them,” the statement said. “Findings of his involvement in terrorist activity will determine whether he will be subject to further ISA questioning.” Hamas has condemned the arrest of Salmiya and medical personnel from the hospital and called on international organisations to work on releasing them immediately. Israeli forces say their air force has struck more than 300 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip within one day. The targets include “military command centres, underground terror tunnels, weapon storage facilities, weapon manufacturing sites, andanti-tank missile launch posts”, Israeli army said in a post on X. Besides pounding Gaza from the air, the Israeli army also continued their offensive on the ground. Filipino students and activists hold a protest at the University of the Philippines in in Quezon City, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Israeli soldiers have killed a Palestinian at the entrance of the village of Burqa, east of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. The killing on Thursday brings to a total of 228 Palestinians who have been killed in Israeli army and settler attacks in the occupied West Bank since October 7.  As we reported earlier, the right-wing Israeli national security minister has ordered prison authorities to stop any attempts to celebrate the expected release of Palestinians once the truce comes into effect. Ben-Gvir said the celebration is the equivalent of “terrorism”, likening it to supporting what Hamas was doing. “This is something that Israel has often been accusing Palestinians of, which is exactly why some of them were detained in the first place.” Al Jazeera’s Sara Khairat reported from Tel Aviv. “If they showed support for those in Gaza, they would be accused of supporting Hamas. “Ben-Gvir also recently visited one of the Israeli prisons and ensured that the Israeli national anthem was playing on loudspeakers for the prisoners to hear. There have been videos showing Israeli forces forcing detainees to listen to that, which in other countries is a form of torture to some degree.” At least 10 people have been killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli bombing of a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City. We will bring you more updates on this shortly. There’s a mix of excitement and anticipation about the expected release of Palestinian prisoners, combined with the feeling that people will believe it when they see it. The people we’ve been speaking to say that they simply can’t trust that this go will smoothly – that even if people are released, they are likely to be rearrested. That is a dynamic they’ve seen happen over and over again. They also weigh their happiness against the idea that their relatives might be coming home against the ongoing bombardment of Gaza. The more than 14,000 lives lost in the war on Gaza at Israeli hands and the more than 7,200 people that remained in Israeli jails. A third of these detainees have been picked up since the war began, and just in the last 24 hours, 90 more people were detained in Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank. So people here say as long as Israel maintains its occupation and policy of doing whatever it wants in Palestinian communities, then any of these releases aren’t long-term enough; there’s no permanent freedom guaranteed not just for those who are being released now but also for the residents of these Palestinian communities.

Dozens from same fam­i­ly killed in Gaza as Is­rael con­tin­ues bom­bard­ment,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/dozens-from-same-family-killed-in-gaza-as-israel-continues-bombardment,"Israel continues to bombard the besieged Gaza Strip hours after a truce agreement was announced. Dozens of people from the same family have been killed in the Jabalia refugee camp, the Palestinian foreign minister has said, as Israel continued to bombard the besieged Gaza Strip in the hours after an agreement was reached for atrucethat was expected to go into effect on Thursday. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said on a visit to London on Wednesday that 52 members of one family were killed in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. “Only this morning, from the Qadoura family in Jabalia, 52 people have been wiped out completely, killed,” he said. “I have the list of the names, 52 of them. They were wiped out completely from grandfather to grandchildren.” In southern Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said that heavy strikes continued on Wednesday in the lead-up to the humanitarian pause. “These areas are considered to be ‘safe places’ to flee to from the north,” he said after an Israeli strike left a residential building in Khan Younis “completely destroyed”. “But they are experiencing the same level of Israeli bombardments.” Separately in Khan Younis, the bodies of more than 100 Palestinians originally held at the al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, which has been repeatedly raided by Israeli forces, were buried in a mass grave. The agreement between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs Gaza, comes after nearly seven weeks of war in the besieged territory that has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands of others. Key details of the agreement remain unclear, but it is expected to include the release of 50 civilian hostages held in Gaza, the release of 150 Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons and a four-day haltto hostilitiesin Gaza. The pause is expected to coincide with an influx of humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres described the agreement as “an important step in the right direction,” but added that “much more needs to be done to end the suffering”. The deal, expected to come into effect on Thursday morning, has been welcomed by rights groups and political leaders as a sign of potential progress towards the end of the fighting, which began on October 7 when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed about1,200 people, according to Israeli officials.

Alongside the bombardment, Israel hasseverely restrictedsupplies of food, electricity, fuel, and water for the Strip’s more than 2.3 million residents, with international aid groups warning of a humanitarian catastrophe. Medical officials have warned that disease could spread amid dire conditions andcontaminated water. Refugee camps,UN schools, and hospitals sheltering the displaced have all been targeted, and a trickle of humanitarian assistance coming through the border crossing with Egypt has not been enough to address the scale of suffering. Aid groups say a key ambition is to get help to northern Gaza, which has been largely inaccessible and where nearly all hospitals stopped working during a blistering air and ground offensive by Israeli forces. “The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Israeli authorities have stressed that the temporary pause to the fighting will not mean an end to the war. “We are at war, and we will continue the war until we achieve all our goals: to destroy Hamas, return all our hostages and ensure that no entity in Gaza can threaten Israel,” Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahusaid in a recorded message. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said the implementation of the agreement was a “complex process that may take time”.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

What does the Is­rael-Hamas deal mean for Gaza?,https://www.aljazeera.com/program/inside-story/,Content loading timed out,

The Israel-Hamas truce could see him being released. Beit Ummar, occupied West Bank– Fidaa Abu Maria bustles around her simple, sparse home in Beit Ummar north of Hebron, worried then hopeful then scared, in turn. After she makes her son’s bed, she turns to folding his freshly laundered clothes, seeming to whisper prayers to herself with each fold. Her son, Ubai, may be coming home, and she wants to be ready, needs that little burst of hope and optimism. His name was on an Israeli list of 300 people who may be released in an upcoming swap between Hamas and Israel. Fifty captives taken by Hamas to Gaza will be released, to be exchanged for 150 Palestinian women and child prisoners in Israeli jails – that means there is a 50/50 chance that Fidaa may see Ubai soon. She constantly worries about him because when Ubai was arrested by Israeli forces on August 8, four months after his 18th birthday, he only had 30 percent use of one of his hands. He had been shot in the elbow last November and had been undergoing various therapies to regain the use of his hand. But his treatment stopped once he was in the Israeli prison system. Like many young Palestinian boys, this was sadly not the first time Ubai was arrested, he had been taken four times before that. At the beginning of his detention, Ubai was assaulted by the prison guards, resulting in injuries to his head, and isolated for 14 days. “His detention had so many beatings and assaults. I was so scared for his health because of the injury to his hand and because he hadn’t had a chance to get the surgery he was scheduled for. They were supposed to replace his wrist joint, but it never happened. “Since October 7, we’ve been hearing that things got worse for prisoners in the occupation prisons, that they were all assaulted and deprived of the most basic rights such as food, clothing, things like that.” Ubai’s father, Youssef, could barely hold his excitement and worry in. “We’ve been hopeful for a while now, and this morning, a friend called me. He follows Hebrew media, and he woke me up early in the morning to tell me Ubai’s name is on the list. “I’ve been arrested before, and given the 30 times I was arrested, I see the release of my son as if he’s going to be reborn. Prisoners are attacked so much in the occupation prisons. “We are so grateful to the people of Gaza, especially the martyrs and the wounded. All of this is thanks to God first and thanks to the valiant resistance that brought our sons out from darkness to light.” The Abu Maria home is sparse and very simple, neat as a pin and filled with the anxious excitement of the family members. Fidaa flits from one chore or another to sit on one of the beds in the family room to listen to the news. “I’m happy. My feelings are like any Palestinian mother would have when she hears her son may be released: full of joy, but it is bittersweet because our tiny little joy is at the expense of the blood of the people in Gaza. I am grateful, so grateful. “I’ve been cooking. I’m making his favourite food, stuffed zucchini in yoghurt sauce and the desserts he loves, homemade chocolate cakes. He prefers my baking to any other cakes because I am a home pastry chef. “I keep saying that I will happily make him dessert for breakfast every single day, as much as he wants. I’ve set up his room and laundered his new clothes. Everybody is calling me, family and friends. Everyone is excited and wants to come share our joy and welcome him.” Youssef helped as much as he could, then embarked on his own project, decorating the house inside and out to express the family’s almost unbearable hope and joy. All that remained were the most difficult moments to wait for the news of the release.",
"Hamas deal di­vides Is­rael politi­cians, seen as ‘great harm’, ‘painful’",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/hamas-truce-receives-mixed-reactions-from-israeli-politicians,"Israeli PM clinched the deal with support of far-right coalition partners, who severely criticised the move. Israel’s prime minister managed to secure a truce with Hamas with the backing of the far-right coalition partners he needs to stay in power, but several cabinet members expressed their displeasure at giving the Palestinian group too many concessions. The agreement between Israel and Hamas reached early on Wednesday, with mediation from Qatar, includes amulti-day truceand the release of 50 hostages being held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinians jailed by Israel, among other measures. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet approved the truce, hardline members such as Minister for National SecurityItamar Ben-Gvirreiterated opposition even after it was announced. “Hamas wanted this time-out more than anything else,” Ben-Gvir posted on X, and said the pause would give the group time to resupply and reformulate itself, the dpa news agency reported. Ben-Gvir also said on Wednesday that Israel was repeating the mistakes of the past, referring to a 2011 deal when more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners were freed in return for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held by Hamas for five years. After one cabinet member said it was important to send a message of unity, Israeli outlet Ynet reported that Ben-Gvir responded: “But we’re not united. This decision will cause us great harm for generations.” Questions from lawmakers were answered by members of Israel’s military and intelligence establishment, who sought to allay concerns that a pause in the fighting could stunt Israeli momentum after more than a month of relentlessstrikes on Gaza.

President Isaac Herzog acknowledged that the “reservations are understandable, painful, and difficult,” but added in a statement that given the circumstances he backed the government to move forward with the deal. “This is a moral and ethical duty that correctly expresses the Jewish and Israeli value of securing the freedom of those held captive, with the hope that it will be the first step in returning all the hostages home,” Herzog said. Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel on October 7, which Israeli authorities say killed 1,200 people, and kidnapped about 240 people. The deadly assault has shaken Israeli society anddivided opinionsover the right path forward. Representatives of the Religious Zionist party, led by right-wing Finance MinisterBezalel Smotrich, voted in favour of the truce after expressing scepticism. In a social media post, Settlements and National Missions Minister Orit Strock said that she had voted for the proposal “even though I really didn’t plan to” after “detailed reviews, [and] questions answered thoroughly”. Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas, but has faced growing scrutiny over actions in Gaza that critics have said constituteindiscriminate punishmentof the besieged enclave’s population. Netanyahu has made clear that the agreement does not mean the war will stop, and vowed that the Israeli military will press on after the pause in fighting. Israel has cut off access to food, fuel, and electricity for Gaza’s more than 2.3 million residents and wiped out entire neighbourhoods in an assault that Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 14,000 people, with more than 5,600 of themchildren. As conditions in Gaza reach breaking point, pressure had built for a pause in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance into the beleaguered Gaza Strip. Some Israelis, including those who lost loved ones or continue to await their return after being kidnapped during the attack, also called on the government toprioritise the returnof the hostages.

Therefore, we must bring them back.” Israel’s high court on Wednesday rejected a petition by the Almagor Terror Victims Association that said the deal would pose a threat to the country’s security, according to Israeli media reports. The petition argued that releasing some captives, but not all, violated the right to equality, according to The Times of Israel. It had called for a delay in the agreement’s implementation until the government could prove that the truce did not endanger the lives of Israelis. A 24-hour period in which the Israeli public could register legal objections to the government-approved deal had started on Tuesday night.",
"Switzer­land moves to ban Hamas, backs Is­rael’s ‘right to self-de­fence’",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/switzerland-moves-to-ban-hamas-activities-or-support,"Government to introduce legislation by February against Palestinian group, supports Israel’s right to ‘its own security’. The Swiss government has announced it will introduce legislation by the end of February to explicitly ban “Hamas activities or support” for the Palestinian group. The Federal Council, the executive branch, said on Wednesday that it has decided to draft a law to ban the Palestinian group “considering this to be the most appropriate response to the situation that has prevailed in the Middle East since October 7”. “The act will provide the federal authorities with the necessary tools to counter any Hamas activities or support for the organisation in Switzerland.” OnOctober 7, Palestinian fighters from the Gaza Strip, which has been run by Hamas since 2007, launched an attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to the Israeli government. Hamas and other Palestinian factions also took an estimated 240 Israelis and foreigners into the Gaza Strip as captives. Since then, Israel haslauncheda massive air and ground offensive on the beleaguered Strip, killing at least 14,319 people, including more than 5,000 children, local health authorities say. Early on Wednesday, Israel and Hamasagreedon a Qatar-mediated deal for a four-day truce in Gaza and the release of 50 captives held in the enclave for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody, with negotiations ongoing on the timing.

The seven-member council is formed by ministers from the four largest parties, and lawmakers in parliament are likely to swing strongly behind the draft legislation, given the positions of the major parties. The hard-right Swiss People’s Party, the biggest in the country, has been strongly pushing for a ban. On Wednesday, the government called for respect for international humanitarian law and particularly the protection of civilians. It voiced “deep sorrow for the thousands of civilians who have lost their lives in Israel and across the occupied Palestinian territories” and condemned the Hamas attack on October 7 “in the strongest possible terms”. The statement made no mention of Israel’s actions in Gaza but recognised “Israel’s right to ensureits own defenceand security”. “In view of the dramatic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, the Federal Council stresses the need to ensure unimpeded humanitarian access. Humanitarian pauses are necessary for this purpose,” the statement added. Bern reiterated the need to restore the prospect of a political framework in the region based on a two-state solution. “This approach is the only viable path towards ensuring that both the Palestinian and Israeli populations can coexist peacefully, securely and with dignity,” it said. On October 11, the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs (FDFA) suspended millions of dollars in funding to six Palestinian and five Israeli civil society organisations with ongoing international cooperation partnerships with the Swiss government. The 11 partner NGOs were subject to “in-depth verification of their compliance with the FDFA’s code of conduct and the anti-discrimination clause in their contracts”. As a result, three of the NGOs saw their contract with the government terminated.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

At her home in the occupied East Jerusalem town of Sur Baher, Sameera Dwayyat is gripped with anxiety and apprehension. The name of her daughter, Shorouq, who is currently serving the longest sentence of all the female Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, is on the list of prisoners due for release over the next few days in exchange for 50 Israeli captives held in Gaza by Hamas. “I’m so nervous,” Sameera, also known as Imm Ibrahim, told Al Jazeera. “We haven’t heard confirmation about the names [to be released] from any official side, and neither the Red Cross nor the Palestinian Prisoners Club have contacted us.” After six weeks of fighting, Israel and Hamas haveagreed to a four-day trucethat will begin on Thursday. As part of the truce, Israel has agreed to release 150 Palestinian women and children from its prisons, in exchange for Hamas releasing 50 Israeli women and children out of the 237captivesabducted since October 7. Hundreds of trucks carrying vital humanitarian aid and fuel will also be allowed into Gaza. Shorouq Dwayyat, who is currently serving her ninth year of a 16-year sentence, is one of many prisoners who campaigners say have been unjustly tried and sentenced on unfair or fabricated charges. She was also fined 80,000 shekels ($21,500). She was just 18 years old when Israeli forces arrested her as she was walking home on October 7, 2015 after they shot her four times, leaving her in critical condition. She was accused of attempting to stab an Israeli settler with a knife, but her family strongly refutes the charges. “It is impossible for me to believe the Israeli story that my daughter stabbed a settler,” Salah Dwayyat, her father,told Al Jazeeraat the time. “Shorouq is delicate and cannot harm an animal.” Palestinian witnesses said an Israeli settler had tried to pull off her hijab while she was walking past, in a deliberate act of provocation. She pushed back and Israeli forces fired four bullets into her body, leaving her to bleed on the ground for half an hour before arresting her. Shorouq was treated at the Ein Karem/Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, undergoing skin grafts and several operations. She had just started her first semester at Bethlehem University as a geography and history student, after obtaining a 90 percent average in her high school results. “She would be the one to lift my spirits up whenever I would visit her in Damon prison in Haifa,” her mother said. “I had no hope that she would be released early, to the point where she had stopped asking me if I thought there was a chance of that.” The fifth child of seven, Shorouq would ask about her siblings, two of whom have married during the years she has spent in prison, and the nieces and nephews that she could not meet. “This year – call it a mother’s intuition – I had a feeling she would be free,” Sameera said. “I told her during my last visit that I can see her at the front door of our home.” “I hope it will be true,” she added, her voice catching. “I hope she can come home.”  This is a modal window.

In the northern occupied West Bank town of Sila al-Harthiya, Muntaser Jaradat said he cannot wait for his mother, Awatif, to be released from Damon prison in northern Palestine. The 33-year-old was himself released from the notorious Naqab prison on November 1, but two other brothers remain in other prisons. Awatif Jaradat, 50, was arrested in December 2021 after Israeli forces arrested her youngest son, Ghaith, who was 18 at the time. Another son, Omar, 21 was also arrested – as was Muntaser himself two months later. Israeli forces had accused Ghaith of carrying out an attack that resulted in the death of an Israeli settler and the injury of two others. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years. “Israel accused my mother of incitement after she spoke to media saying that she was proud of her sons for resisting the occupation,” Muntaser said. “They wanted a lengthy sentence for her, nine to 15 years in prison.” “They just wanted revenge on our family,” he said. The mother of nine is known for her strong personality, especially in the face of adversity, her son said. Muntaser said that she acted as a medical chaperone for a fellow prisoner, Fatima Shaheen, who was arrested last April after Israeli forces shot her, resulting in wounds that left her paralysed. Shaheen is also on the list of female prisoners due to be released. Awatif was allowed to accompany Shaheen to Ramleh prison for medical treatment, but was not allowed to stay with her. Instead, she was placed three months in solitary confinement at Ramleh, with no communication with the outside world, before being returned to Damon. “The past two years have been hard for my family, who had to travel to four different prisons to see me in Naqab, Ghaith in Nafha, Omar in Gilboa and my mother in Damon,” Muntaser said. “We have had no word about Omar for two months.” He described how Palestinian prisoners had been subject to torture following the Hamas attack on Israeli army outposts and towns outside the Gaza Strip on October 7. “They would beat us so severely, that the ground would be stained with streaks of blood,” he said. “It was like being in Guantanamo Bay or Abu Ghraib prison. They humiliated us and would stomp on us with their boots. They also cut off water and electricity and threw away our belongings.” In Bethlehem, Amna Salameh is optimistic about having her youngest daughter Maysoon Mousa back home after almost nine years in prison. Maysoon was arrested in 2015 when she was 22 years old and sentenced to 15 years in prison after being accused of stabbing a soldier. “We’re happy to hear the news,” she said. “I last saw Maysoon two months ago, but since October 7, we haven’t been allowed visits and we heard that the prisoners are being mistreated badly. We hope all the prisoners will be released and the suffering of our people in Gaza will stop.”",

"Is­rael-Hamas deal: Which cap­tives, Pales­tin­ian pris­on­ers could be freed?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/israel-hamas-deal-which-captives-palestinian-prisoners-could-be-freed,"Hamas and Israel have both said that they will release women and children. Israel and Hamas have agreed to afour-day pausein fighting that includes an exchange of some of the captives taken during the October 7 Hamas attack for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody. Here’s what we know about the captives and prisoners: More than 200 captives were taken by Hamas during itsOctober 7 attack. Of these, about 50 will be released under thedealagreed to on Wednesday. Reuters reported that a senior US official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, saying that there is anticipation that the actual number of captives released will be higher than 50. In the days before the deal, Hamas had released four captives. Israel rescued one soldier who had been abducted and said it had found the bodies of two other captives. The truce calls for 150 Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli jails. About 5,200 Palestinians were in Israeli prisons before October 7. After the outbreak of violence on October 7, another 3,000 were arrested, including 145 children and 95 women. ",
"Di­as­po­ra Pales­tini­ans in Greece fear for rel­a­tives in Gaza, long for peace",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/diaspora-palestinians-in-greece-fear-for-relatives-in-gaza-long-for-peace,"Palestinians in Greece, who blame Israel for the outbreak of war in Gaza, worry they are witnessing forced displacement at an unprecedented rate. Athens, Greece –Diaspora Palestinians who were uprooted during previous crises fear they may be witnessing the biggest forced displacement in their lifetimes. “They tell us to go to the south [of Gaza],” said Salma Shawa, referring to Israel’s order to 1.5 million Palestinians living in the northern Gaza Strip to move south last month. “So slowly, slowly we will go to the border and then to Sinai? Is this the solution? So Gaza will be gone also? And then [the Israelis] will go to the West Bank and Jerusalem, so we will all be gone?” Israel ordered the evacuation, claiming it was attempting to minimise civilian casualties as it launched a ground war against Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people. But after telling Palestinians to leave their homes, Israel bombed sites in the south, including areas it had declared as safe. Since Israel declared war against Hamas, it has killed more than 14,100 Palestinians in Gaza, the densely populated enclave run by the Palestinian armed group. Shawa, whose father, grandfather and great-grandfather all served as mayors of Gaza, is not sure evacuated Palestinians will ever be allowed to return. Her sister, who still lives in Gaza with her family, had to leave because her house was damaged by bombing. “My sister is not sure they can go back to their houses. Some of them tried and they were bombed,” said Shawa. Shawa arrived in Athens in 2000 and now works for the Athens Bar Association. Others have been here longer, in a community approximately 13,000-strong. Razan Simaan’s parents were forced from Palestine during the Nakba, or catastrophe, as it is known, of 1948. Between 1947 and 1949, Palestinians were dispossessed and displaced as Israel was created, with Zionist paramilitaries forcibly removing 750,000 Palestinians from their homes. About 15,000 Palestinians were killed, including in several massacres. Simaan was born in Beirut. Her family moved to Athens during the first Lebanese civil war. Hamas’s attack came as no surprise, she said. “There’s nothing happening that’s new, it’s just much more amplified,” Simaan said. “We’re a little bit in shock that this isn’t clearer to the rest of the world. For us injustice is something we were born with and grew up with.” Israel’s Western allies – the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union – have labelled Hamas a “terrorist organisation”. “Hamas is irrelevant,” said Simaan. “Hamas wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for the occupation. It is a direct outcome of Israel.” Other Palestinians agree with her. “Anyone who is under occupation has the right to use whatever means necessary to be free,” said Latif Darwish, a professor of economics and crisis management at Cardiff Metropolitan University. “Hamas simply launched a military attack, which is something Palestinians are on the receiving end of every day. It was not a crime,” Darwish said. Like many Palestinians here, Darwish believed the Israelis knew the attack was coming and let it happen in order to invade Gaza. He said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently brandished a map showing all of Palestine as sovereign Israeli territory at the United Nations General Assembly. “There was a plan to eliminate Gaza or the people of Gaza. They were looking for an excuse,” said Ahmed Hassan, the president of the Palestinian Association. He pointed to reports that Egyptian intelligence had tipped off the Israelis of an impending attack on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. “Perhaps [the Israeli government] welcomed this attack without realising what the consequences would be,” Hassan suggested.  The Palestinians who spoke to Al Jazeera believed there was still hope for Palestinian self-determination and peace with Israel but were not sure what the formula should be. “We don’t hate like the Israelis … We don’t see the Israelis as a different race. We even call them our cousins because we are similar,” said Shawa. She remembered sitting with her mother, an elected representative in the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature formed under the Oslo Accords in 1996. The accords promised eventual Palestinian statehood, and Shawa witnessed Palestinians governing themselves in a time of hope. “It was a really democratic debate,” she remembered. “Although Hamas did not get in officially, a lot of their members were in. There were some Islamist-leaning members and Fatah, and also other factions … There was something really special about it.” She believes Palestinians can regain this shining moment, when they came so close to independence, but even she does not believe the Oslo Accords can be revived. “The two-state solution is dead. It’s too late for it,” she said. She also did not believe a Palestinian-Jordanian confederation could happen, something her grandfather once proposed. Nor did she believe Israelis were likely to invite the Palestinians into a unified state encompassing the West Bank and Gaza. Darwish agreed that for such a “South Africa scenario” to happen, “Israel has to feel it is unsafe, that it will lose everything unless it makes some concession.” And Hassan did not think it was even desirable. “Even the 1.5 million Palestinians [who are Israeli citizens] are third class citizens,” he said. So what is the solution? US President Joe Biden said he remained committed to a two-state solution. “Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure … as we all work toward a two-state solution,” he wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece. “What I do know is the people really want peace,” said Shawa. “We were not able to communicate this to Israel. This is the main problem.” Darwish agreed that peace was the unifying factor. “I would go back tomorrow, with all my children,” he said. “Tomorrow.”",
Analy­sis: A pause in fight­ing – what’s in it for Hamas?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/analysis-a-pause-in-fighting-whats-in-it-for-hamas,"Hamas can benefit militarily from the ambiguous truce deal, but as an opportunity rather than a necessity. Thedealthat people on all sides of the fighting in Gaza and the international community anticipated and longed for has finally been agreed. In many ways, it has been vague, starting with the time it was accepted by all sides – overnight on Wednesday and across 8 hours’ worth of time zones between Qatar, the main intermediary, and Washington, the principal force pushing the Israeli cabinet, with its reluctant and eager ministers, to accept it. The deal’s designation is vague, possibly deliberately: The official statement from Qatar calls it a“humanitarian pause”but media in the Arab world and Israel seem to prefer “truce” or “ceasefire”, as does world media. Apart from the difference in meaning between those terms, this reflects how sensitive the weeks-long indirect negotiations must have been. True to the uncomfortable and nervous relationship between Israeli and Hamas negotiators, even the duration is vague: Leaks during the last days of the indirect talks have ranged from three to five days. In the end, the span is in the middle, four days but, to add vagueness, the deal allows for the extension by one day for each extra batch of 10 captives Hamas releases. The final ambiguity is when this difficult deal will come into force – that will be announced by the end of Wednesday. Yesterday, I analysedwhat Israel has to gainand lose from the deal. The slight change now is that Netanyahu earned some brownie points with the Israeli public by presenting the Israeli cabinet with the deal, which he was most likely arm-twisted into by Joe Biden. Still, his political survival after the fighting in Gaza stops for good is far from being assured. His initial public opposition to the first mentions of a deal indicated the opinion of the Israeli extreme right wing, politically mostly directed byJewish settlersin the occupied West Bank and their patrons in the Knesset and cabinet. To them, Hamas are terrorists to be killed, eradicated and expelled from the Gaza Strip with captives being released either voluntarily or by force, and they took any suggestion of negotiating with Hamas as an insult and an offence. Having become the party that negotiates with the State of Israel, even if through intermediaries, Hamas gained political acceptance in the international community. In just six weeks sinceOctober 7, its status changed from “terrorists with whom any negotiations are unacceptable” to “an organisation that has control on the ground”. Even though Israel and the United States continue calling it “terrorist”, a term that usually connotes “people we do not negotiate with”, they have recognised reality and accepted the Palestinian organisation as their opposite side in negotiations. To be sure, Hamas and Israel have negotiated truces in the past, always through third-party mediation, usually that of Egypt. But those were tactical battlefield issues rather than full-fledged international agreements involving several states.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

As I explained yesterday, it is militarily very convenient for Israel but makes no real difference for Hamas, despite fears voiced by the Israeli public that it would use the opportunity to regroup. Unlike Israel, which has a conventional army that fights on the ground and whose progress can be easily followed by plotting the positions of its armoured formations on commercially available satellite photos, theQassam Brigadesare almost untraceable from the air. They move lightly, on foot aboveground, or underground through the network of tunnels crisscrossing the Strip. Their weapons, apart from multiple-rocket launchers, are small and portable, so they can be moved via the tunnels. By keeping the uniformed fighters and their easily movable weaponry underground, Hamas largely stays beyond the reach of most conventional means of detection. Hamas command centres are under the ground, Hamas armouries are below the surface, andHamas tunnelsconnect those with almost every point in the Gaza Strip – so why would Hamas need a pause in the fighting to regroup if it can do so anyway? Certainly, it will exploit the four quiet days, if they indeed happen, to its military advantage, but that is an opportunistic, tactical chance rather than a strategic necessity. If the ceasefire holds, Hamas will be able to reduce the number of fighters on lookouts, in ambushes and on operational readiness, giving its fighters some much-needed rest and a possibility to dash for a brief reunion with their families wherever in Gaza they may be. Both militaries will need to be on alert during the pause as the realities on the ground are often much different than the beliefs and expectations of those who imagine the battlefield from afar and negotiate from secure offices and comfortable international hotels. In most wars that I witnessed, ceasefires were broken, often by unpredictable and uncontrollable events on the ground. The shortest internationally brokered ceasefire I remember, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, lasted a full one minute and 17 seconds if my memory serves me right. Any hothead with a gun, and there are more than 50,000 such potential own decision-makers, can decide that he has a reason to take any of his grudges to his enemies. If just one soldier lets off a few bullets, he may jeopardise all hopes of four days with nobody getting killed, some civilians getting to safety, much-neededaidcoming in, restoration of some civilian infrastructure and freeing ofcaptives and prisoners. Having surmounted all the difficulties to clinch the deal, the world can now just pray that the commanders on both sides can, for 96 hours, exercise full and effective control of their forces.

Ex-Oba­ma ad­vis­er says more Pales­tin­ian kids should die in Is­lam­o­pho­bic rant,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/ex-us-diplomat-goes-on-islamophobic-rant-wishes-more-dead-palestinian-kids,"‘If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids, it wasn’t enough,’ says former diplomat Stuart Seldowitz to a halal cart vendor in one video. A former senior US official is facing a backlash after harassing a halal food vendor in New York. Stuart Seldowitz, who previously served as deputy director of the United States Department of State’s Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs, was captured on video taunting and threatening the vendor in Manhattan. Amid the apparent argument over the ongoing Gaza war, he told his adversary that more Palestinian children should die.  “If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids, it wasn’t enough,” Seldowitz says calmly in one exchange captured on video and posted on the social media platform X. In other exchanges, he’s heard casting slurs against Prophet Muhammad. He also threatens to use his government connections to mobilise Egypt’s secret police against the vendor, who he accuses of being a “terrorist”. “The Mukhabarat in Egypt will get your parents. Does your father like his fingernails? They’ll take them out one by one,” Seldowitz says smiling. The vendor is heard repeatedly asking him to leave and telling him he does not speak English. Seldowitz says the vendor’s lack of English fluency shows he is “ignorant”. “You should learn English, it’ll help you when they deport you back to Egypt and the Mukhabarat wants to interview you,” he tells the vendor with a grin. Seldowitz reportedly had a distinguished career with the State Department. He also served on the National Security Council’s South Asia Directorate under then-President Barack Obama and went on to become foreign affairs chair at New York lobbying firm Gotham Government Relations, according to a 2022 pressreleasefrom the company. The former diplomat admitted in an interview with The New York Times that he had gotten angry with the Manhattan vendor and said things he “probably [regrets]”. He claimed the vendor enraged him after expressing sympathies for the Palestinian group Hamas, although none of the videos shows the vendor mentioning the group. “I got rather upset and I’ve said things to him, that in retrospect, I probably regret,” Seldowitz told the newspaper. “Instead of focusing in on him and what he said, I expanded into insulting his religion and so on.” Seldowitz insisted that he is not Islamophobic, saying that he has many Muslim and Arab colleagues who could vouch for him. Gotham Government Relations on Tuesday said it had severed all ties with Seldowitz and apparently scrubbed his profile from their website. The firm’s CEO, David Schwartz, said he was “personally outraged and offended by” Seldowitz’s “vile” language and offered to legally represent the food vendor pro bono. The incident underscores growing tensions globally and in the US over the 47-day war in Gaza, which has killed at least 14,100 Palestinians, more than a third of them children. Since October 7, frequent pro-Israel and pro-Palestinedemonstrationshave taken place in New York, which has large Muslim and Jewish populations.",

Speaking in unscripted remarks at his Wednesday general audience in St Peter’s Square, the head of the Catholic Church said he had heard directly how “both sides are suffering” during meetings with the Israeli relatives of Hamas-held captives and with Palestinians who have family in Gaza. “This is what wars do. But here, we have gone beyond wars. This is not war. This is terrorism,” he said. He asked for prayers so that both sides would “not go ahead with passions, which, in the end, kill everyone”. The pope’s meetings and his comments came hours after Israel and Hamasagreed to a four-day trucemediated byQatar. The two sides agreed to the release of 50 women and children held captive in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli custody.  The agreement also includes desperately needed humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza following weeks of relentless Israeli attacks that have killed more than 14,100 people, including 5,600 children, and forced about 1.7 million from their homes. About 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s attack on Israel.",
EU to boost Gaza aid amid Is­rael-Hamas truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/eu-to-step-up-aid-deliveries-to-gaza-during-pause-in-israel-hamas-war,"The EU chief orders the European Commission ‘to do its utmost’ to use the four-day truce to boost its aid deliveries. The European Commission says it will step up aid deliveries to Gaza during the agreed four-day pause in Israel’s war. Welcoming the agreement, Ursula von der Leyen, chief of the EU’s executive body, said the bloc will use the window to get more humanitarian into the Palestinian enclave. “The European Commission will do its utmost to use this pause for a humanitarian surge to Gaza,” she said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that “I wholeheartedly welcome the agreement”. Tamer Qarmout, assistant professor in public policy at the Doha Institute, told Al Jazeera that the most important thing that needs to be addressed during the pause is the catastrophic humanitarian condition in Gaza. “It’s about food and shelter. Winter is here in Gaza, people are sleeping outside, and there’s nothing to cover them. So it’s a disaster. Aid needs to be increased and the international community need to push Israel on this,” Qarmout said. Von der Leyen’s comments came a day after the commission announced a review of its development aid to Palestinians – ordered after the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas – found no evidence of funds going to the armed group that rules Gaza. “The review found no indications of EU money having directly or indirectly benefitted the terrorist organisation Hamas,” Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday. The EU is the biggest provider of development aid to Palestinians. It has earmarked about 1.2 billion euros ($1.3bn) for its programmes for the period between 2021 and 2024. Brussels was forced, in the wake of the October 7 attacks, to deny it would cut all aid to Gaza in October, following a statement by the Hungarian-nominated commissioner for neighbourhood and enlargement. Oliver Varhelyi stated on social media that “all payments” to the Palestinians had been “immediately suspended” and that “all new budget proposals,” including for 2023, had been “postponed until further notice”.  The commission scrambled to clarify that Varhelyi’s statement was not official and that humanitarian funds would continue to flow, while an “urgent review” would be conducted regarding development assistance that was earmarked but not yet disbursed.

Development aid is used for projects designed to have a long-term impact, such as paying the salaries of officials at the Palestinian Authority, which governs the occupied West Bank, and the work of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. It is separate from humanitarian aid, meant for urgent needs for essentials such as food, water and shelter. “The review found that the control system in place has worked. As a result payment to Palestinian beneficiaries and UNRWA will continue without any delays,” Dombrovskis told reporters. The commission said, however, that it would not proceed with plans to provide 75.6 million euros ($82.5m) for Gaza infrastructure projects that were not “feasible in the current context”. That money will now go to other projects after Israel launched its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 attacks. The enclave’s Hamas-run government says at least 14,100 Palestinians have been confirmed killed during Israel’s aerial blitz and invasion. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas’s attacks stands at about 1,200. ",

Hamas and Israel have expressed in statements their readiness to resume hostilities after theyagreedto a Qatar-mediated pause in fighting. The deal includes the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails in exchange for 50 people held captive by Hamas in Gaza since the armed group that rules the enclave stormed southern Israel on October 7. Under the terms of the deal, Israel will halt all military actions in Gaza for four days, and allow hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian and medical aid and fuel into the territory. Here are the statements issued by the warring sides, as well as the mediator: “The State of Qatar announces the success of its joint mediation efforts undertaken with the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United States of America between Israel and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), resulting in an agreement for a humanitarian pause. The starting time of the pause will be announced within the next 24 hours and last for four days, subject to extension. The agreement includes the release of 50 civilian women and children hostages currently held in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons, the number of those released will be increased in later stages of implementing the agreement. The humanitarian pause will also allow the entry of a larger number of humanitarian convoys and relief aid, including fuel designated for humanitarian needs. The State of Qatar affirms its commitment to ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, stop the bloodshed, and protect civilians. In this regard, the State of Qatar appreciates the efforts of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United States of America in reaching this agreement.” “Inspired by our responsibility towards our patient and determined Palestinian people, and our tireless endeavour to support the steadfastness of our heroic people in the dignified Gaza Strip, and to provide relief and treat their wounds, and in our work to consolidate the will of our victorious resistance on October 7 in the face of the Zionist enemy.  Following complex and difficult negotiations for many days, we announce, with the help of God Almighty, that we have reached a humanitarian truce agreement (a temporary pause in fighting) for four days, through the persistent and appreciated efforts of Qatar and Egypt, according to which [there will be]: – A pause in fighting from both sides, a cessation of all military actions by the occupation army in all areas of the Gaza Strip, and a cessation of the movement of its military vehicles penetrating into the Gaza Strip. – Allowing hundreds of trucks of humanitarian, relief, medical and fuel aid into all areas of the Gaza Strip, without exception, in the north and the south. – The release of 50 women and children below the age of 19 years of the occupation detainees, in exchange for the release of 150 women and children below the age of 19 years of our people from the occupation prisons, all according to length of their imprisonment. – Stopping air traffic in the south for four days. – Stopping air traffic in the north for six hours a day, from 10am until 4pm. – During the pause of fighting, the occupation is committed not to attack or arrest anyone in all areas of the Gaza Strip. – Ensuring freedom of movement of people (from north to south) along Salah al-Din Road. – The terms of this agreement were formulated in accordance with the vision of the resistance and its principles, which aim to serve our people and strengthen their steadfastness in the face of aggression, and it is always mindful of their sacrifices, suffering and concerns, and it conducted these negotiations from a position of steadfastness and strength in the field, despite the occupation’s attempts to prolong and procrastinate the negotiations. – While we announce the arrival of a pause of fighting agreement, we affirm that our hands will remain on the trigger, and our victorious brigades will remain on the lookout to defend our people and defeat the occupation and its aggression. – We promise our people that we will remain loyal to their blood, their sacrifices, their patience, their steadfastness, and their aspirations for liberation and freedom, the restoration of rights, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, God willing.” “The Government of Israel is obligated to return home all of the hostages. Tonight, the government has approved the outline of the first stage of achieving this goal, according to which at least 50 hostages – women and children – will be released over four days, during which a pause in the fighting will be held. The release of every additional ten hostages will result in one additional day in the pause.

Is­rael-Hamas truce deal: All that you need to know,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/israel-hamas-truce-all-you-need-to-know,"The two sides have agreed to a four-day pause in fighting, but Israel has made it clear that it is not ending the war. After more than six weeks of fighting that has destroyed extensive areas of Gaza and killed thousands, Israel and Palestinian armed group Hamas haveagreed to a four-day truce. Since October 7, when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel and killed 1,200 people, the Israeli army has been relentlessly bombarding Gaza with air and ground attacks, killingmore than 14,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. An estimated 1.7 million Palestinians have been displaced and forced by the Israeli army to flee to the southern areas of the Strip. Here’s what you need to know about the truce deal: The agreement was mediated byQatar, which had been leading negotiations between Israel and Hamas, while coordinating with other regional and global powers, including the United States and Egypt. US President Joe Biden thanked Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt for their role in the breakthrough. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he had leaned on Biden to secure a better deal for Israel, and thanked the US president for his efforts. Netanyahu also made it clear that the country was not ending its war on Gaza and that the stopping of fighting was only temporary.  No. As of Wednesday morning, fighting continued between the two sides. Qatar said that the start time of the pause would be declared within 24 hours. After weeks of hectic negotiations and multiple instances when a deal appeared on the horizon before falling apart, Netanyahu called a meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday night. The Israeli prime minister presented the proposed deal to his ministers, and only three members of his cabinet opposed it — National Security MinisterItamar Ben-Gvirand two other members of his far-right political party.  Neither side is expected to hold back on restarting hostilities if the other breaks — or is perceived to have broken — any of the terms of the agreement. Israel is not withdrawing its soldiers,tanks, armoured vehiclesand other military infrastructure from Gaza, which it entered late in October in a ground offensive. Israel’s parliament has 24 hours to appeal against the truce agreement with its High Court. The first exchange of captives and prisoners is expected to take place after that period, on Thursday or Friday. James Dorsey, senior fellow at the National University of Singapore’s Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera that Israel’s temporary truce with Hamas is just a first step in difficult negotiations ahead, with a lasting peace in Gaza still far off. “What this [deal] tells you is how difficult things are going to be going forward. Once you get to the question of releasing Israeli military personnel held captive by Hamas these negotiations are going to become much more difficult. “My sense is that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was caught in a bind. On the one hand domestic pressure – which wants the hostages released and wants them released now – and, on the other hand, US pressure to allow for a truce.”",
Pho­tos: Bury­ing the bod­ies of uniden­ti­fied vic­tims of Is­rael’s war on Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/22/burying-the-bodies-of-unidentified-victims-of-israels-war-on-gaza,"In Pictures Deir el-Balah –Dozens of bodies, wrapped in improvised white cloths that double as shrouds, lie together in a newly dug mass grave. They are the unidentified Palestinians who were killed in Israeli attacks, their bodies are either charred beyond recognition or torn apart, to the point where the burial supervisors are sometimes not completely sure if they got the whole person. But the team at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital does its best to offer the proper Islamic burial rituals to the remains, hoping that their efforts will allow the deceased victims to rest. Yasser Abu Ammar, who supervises the ritual washing of the dead at the hospital, told Al Jazeera: “About 80 percent of the bodies we receive are torn apart. We’re burying torn-apart limbs, and some bodies have their organs lacerated and exposed. “We’ve never seen anything like this, like these puzzling wounds inflicted on these mangled body parts.” Abu Ammar added that he had supervised the burial of body parts belonging to a six-member family in one shroud. “All of them barely made up one complete body,” he said. Mohammed al-Hajj, hospital spokesperson, said about 150 unknown bodies have been buried so far, documented by a committee of police and health officials. The bodies are numbered and photographed for the record. “We also include information about the Israeli bombing that hit them, the date and place of the attack and the timing,” al-Hajj said. “We also record the names of the wounded and identified deceased people who arrived at the hospital at the same time.” “It’s very hard to identify these bodies,” Abu Ammar said. “Family members resort to scrutinising body parts to catch a scar or a mole or even the burned remains of clothes that will help them identify their loved ones, but most of them can’t.” In all his years of washing and burying bodies, he said, the first time he encountered unknown bodies was during this, the current Israeli offensive on Gaza. “When I’m at home, my brain plays the tape of everything I saw that day … in detail. I can’t stop it. I’ve had the most terrible nightmares about these bodies.” “This is the most harrowing thing I’ve ever been through.” Photographs are helpful if relatives come to the hospital inquiring about their loved ones, but Abu Ammar says that in most cases, the victims’ skulls are shattered and their faces burned beyond recognition. “These bodies were human beings … had dignity,” he said. “To see their bodies reduced to burned remains or chopped pieces is unbearable.”",
World re­ac­tions to Is­rael-Hamas truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/reactions-to-israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal,"Agreement will see some captives released from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a four-day truce mediated by Qatar that will see the release of 50 women and children held captive in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. Thedealwas announced on Wednesday, and the starting time is expected to be confirmed within the next 24 hours, according to a statement from Qatar. The agreement also includes desperately needed humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza following weeks of relentless Israeli attacks that have killed more than 14,100 people, including 5,600 children, and forced about 1.7 million from their homes. About 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s attack on Israel. Here are some reactions to the announcement: The Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed hopes that the move “will help alleviate the plight of the humanitarian crisis, promote the de-escalation of conflicts, and ease tensions”. Von der Leyen welcomed the agreement reached between Israel and Hamas on the release of 50 captives and a pause in hostilities in Gaza. “The European Commission will do its utmost to use this pause for a humanitarian surge to Gaza,” she said in a statement. Egypt hailed the success of the mediation it conducted alongside Qatar and the United States in brokering a “humanitarian truce” in the Gaza Strip. Sisi also welcomed the planned “exchange of hostages for prisoners” held in Israeli jails, the president’s office said. Foreign Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna stated: “We hope that there will be French people among the first batch of hostages to be released.” “Following the mass atrocities of recent weeks, today’s agreement is welcome. “Hostage-taking and blocking of life-saving aid are war crimes that are never justified. Human beings are not bargaining chips. Ceasefire or not, unlawful attacks should cease once and for all.” Iran announced that Foreign Minister Amirabdollahian will begin a regional tour, starting in Lebanon, following the deal announcement between Israel and Hamas. “The visit is in line with Iran’s diplomatic efforts to halt the Zionist regime’s attacks on Gaza, lift the blockade and send humanitarian aid to the oppressed people of Gaza,” Nournews agency, affiliated to Iran’s top security body, reported. “The Government of Israel is obligated to return home all of the hostages,” it said in a statement. “The government of Israel, [the Israeli army] and the security services will continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza.” The far-right Israeli minister, who voted against the truce deal, has slammed the agreement, saying it sets a “dangerous precedent” and “changes the equation”. While he says that there is an “advantage” to the deal with the return of captives, “we have no right and authority to agree to the idea of ​​separating them and returning only a part”. “Hamas wanted this time-out more than anything,” he said on X. “This decision will cause us great harm for generations,” he was quoted as saying by Israeli media during the government meeting. The Jordanian foreign minister expressed some dismay about the deal, saying a “broader plan for Gaza” is needed and warning against the risk of ethnic cleansing. Despite the truce deal, there is still a huge gap in the delivery of necessary humanitarian aid, and the future of the residents of northern Gaza is in jeopardy, he added. “People must be empowered to remain in their homes, not displaced.” Furthermore, Safadi said, the situation in the West Bank is deteriorating with “potential for an explosion of violence getting very high”. “President Mahmoud Abbas and the leadership welcome the humanitarian truce agreement, appreciate the Egyptian [and] Qatari effort that has been exerted.” The PLO statement called “for a comprehensive cessation of the Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people” and reiterated the need for “humanitarian aid, and the implementation of a political solution based on international legitimacy that leads to the end of the occupation and the achievement of the Palestinian people’s freedom, independence and sovereignty”. Sheikh Mohammed wrote on X that the Gulf state hoped the deal would “establish a comprehensive and sustainable agreement” that would “put an end to the war and the bloodshed and lead to serious talks for a comprehensive and just peace process”.  The Kremlin hailed the agreement as the “first good news for a long time”. “Russia and most countries in the world have been calling for a ceasefire and for a humanitarian pause. Because it is only on the basis of these kinds of pauses that some outlines of future attempts at a sustainable settlement can be built,” Peskov said. “Humanitarian aid should be sustained and expanded, and it should not later become contingent on further hostage releases,” said Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. “Punishing the civilian population of Gaza for the holding of those hostages is absolutely not acceptable,” he added. The Turkish president said he is considering going to Egypt to help arrange more help for the injured in Gaza. The Islamic world must act in a spirit of unity and solidarity on Gaza, Erdogan told reporters. “When that fist hits the table with all its force, it will not be possible for Israel to continue its occupation or oppression.” He said efforts must be made to ensure a ceasefire, deliver sufficient aid to Gaza and rebuild the city using economic, political and diplomatic means. “We must force Israel to comply with international law and be held accountable for its actions,” he added. “I may arrange a trip to Egypt as soon as possible,” Erdogan said, to discuss evacuations of the injured. Cameron stated that the pause was a “crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “I urge all parties to ensure the agreement is delivered in full,” Cameron said. Biden welcomed the deal and thanked Qatar and Egypt for their efforts to secure the agreement. “Jill and I have been keeping all those held hostage and their loved ones close to our hearts these many weeks, and I am extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls, who have endured weeks of captivity and an unspeakable ordeal, will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented,” he said in astatement. He stressed it needed to be “carried through in its entirety” and that it was “important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented”. Blinken, replying to Biden’s statement on X, applauded the role of the US in the deal. “Today’s outcome is the result of tireless diplomacy and relentless effort across the United States government,” he posted. “While this deal marks significant progress, we will not rest as long as Hamas continues to hold hostages in Gaza.”  Schumer, who leads the US Senate, said he was “pleased and relieved” that 50 captives would soon be returning to their families. He said it was a “positive development” that the pause in fighting would “allow additional humanitarian assistance into Gaza for the millions of innocent Palestinians who have nothing to do with Hamas” and said the Senate would “continue working to pass additional humanitarian assistance for innocent Palestinians, and make sure that Israel has the aid it needs to defend itself to ensure Hamas can never again pose such a threat to Israel”. Pope Francis said the conflict had gone beyond war to become “terrorism” after separate meetings with Israeli relatives of hostages held by Hamas, as well as Palestinians with family in Gaza. Speaking in unscripted remarks at his Wednesday general audience in St Peter’s Square, Francis said he heard directly how “both sides are suffering”. Russell, who has recently returned from a trip to southern Gaza, welcomed the agreement to pause the fighting but said the truce was not enough to save lives. “For children to survive…, for humanitarian workers to stay and effectively deliver…, humanitarian pauses are simply not enough,” she told the UN Security Council. Russell called for “an urgent humanitarian ceasefire to immediately put a stop to this carnage.”",
"Is­rael, Hamas agree to truce, paving way for some cap­tives’ re­lease",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/israel-agrees-to-ceasefire-deal-paving-way-for-some-captives-release,"Fifty women and children held captive in Gaza will be released in exchange for Palestinian women and children in Israeli prisons. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a temporary pause in the war that will enable the release of about 50 people who have been held captive in Gaza since the Hamas armed group stormed southern Israel on October 7, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The Israeli cabinet backed the agreement after talks on aQatar-mediated dealthat continued into the early hours of Wednesday morning, with Israeli media reporting heated exchanges between ministers of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. In the end, only three of the 38 members of the cabinet voted against the truce – National Security MinisterItamar Ben-Gvirand two other members of his far-right political party. The prime minister’s office said the deal would require Hamas to release at least 50 women and children during a four-day truce.  For every additional 10 hostages released, the pause would be extended by a day, it said, without mentioning the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange. “Israel’s government is committed to return all the hostages home. Tonight, it approved the proposed deal as a first stage to achieving this goal,” it said in its brief statement. Hamas, which controls Gaza, also released a statement, confirming that 50 women and children held in the territory would be freed in exchange for Israel releasing 150 Palestinian women and children from Israeli jails. It said that Israel would also stop all military actions in Gaza and that hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian, medical and fuel aid would be allowed into the territory.  This is a modal window.

In a statement issued later, Qatar confirmed the “success” of mediation efforts, which also involved Egypt and the United States, and confirmed the broad parameters of the agreement. “The starting time of the pause will be announced within the next 24 hours and last for four days, subject to extension,” the statement said. It confirmed that humanitarian aid would be sent to Gaza and that 50 women and children held captive there would be released in exchange for “a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons”. The “number of those released will be increased in later stages of implementing the agreement,” it added without going into detail. Thanking the Qatar Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and Egypt’s President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, for their “critical leadership and partnership”, US President Joe Biden welcomed the deal. “I look forward to speaking with each of these leaders and staying in close contact as we work to ensure this deal is carried through in its entirety,” the White House said in a statement. “It is important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented.” Ahead of the meeting to discuss the deal, Netanyahu thanked Biden for his work to include more captives and fewer concessions in the agreement. “It took significant US pressure to get this deal done, which really tells you what it’s going to take in terms of US pressure to get something more permanent in place if not a transition to Palestinian self-rule of some kind,” James Dorsey, an honorary fellow at the National University of Singapore’s Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera. Netanyahu stressed that Israel had no intention of ending the conflict. “We are at war and we will continue the war until we achieve all our goals,” he said in a recorded message. “To destroy Hamas, return all our hostages and ensure that no entity in Gaza can threaten Israel.” Still, some analysts said the international community should use the pause to try and secure a more lasting end to the fighting. “In the coming days, more aid will come in, more fuel, hopefully more medical supplies and the most seriously injured can be evacuated, but beyond that, in these coming days of pause, there needs to be massive pressure on Israel to not recommence the fighting at the end of this period,” said Antony Loewenstein, an independent journalist and author based in Australia. About 237 captives from Israel and several other countries are believed to be in Gaza, and Biden said some Americans would be released during the upcoming pause. Otherforeign nationalsare not thought to be part of the agreement. Hamas has released only four captives since the abductions took place more than a month ago – an Americanmother and her daughterandtwo elderly Israeli women. It has said some of the captives were killed in the Israeli bombardment. The al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which was also involved in Hamas’s October 7 raid, said late on Tuesday that one of the Israelis it was holding captive had died. “We previously expressed our willingness to release her for humanitarian reasons but the enemy was stalling and this led to her death,” they said on their Telegram channel.",

We’ll soon be closing this live page. Here’s a recap of today’s main events: The pair “agreed that the work is not yet done and the president assured the prime minister that he will continue working to secure the release of all remaining hostages” in Gaza, the White House said in a readout of the talks. “The president further emphasised the importance of maintaining calm along the Lebanese border as well as in the West Bank.” Turkey’s relations with Israel go back decades, even if there have been many bumpy moments. Despite fiery rhetoric from Turkey’s leadership, the country has not gone as far as some other countries – such as Bolivia – in cutting ties with Israel over the war in Gaza.

Ubai was arrested by Israeli forces on August 8, just as he was due to receive surgery to regain the use of his hand, destroyed by an Israeli bullet. His mother, Fidaa, worries about him daily because his medical treatment has stopped in the Israeli prison system. But now, and for the families of 300 others, hope has once again been rekindled. Ubai’s name was on a list of imprisoned Palestinians who might be freed as part of the Israel-Hamas truce. “I keep saying that I will happily make him dessert for breakfast every single day, as much as he wants … Everybody is calling me, family and friends. Everyone is excited and wants to come share our joy and welcome him,” Fidaa told Al Jazeera Read more about one Palestinian family anxiously awaiting the start of the truce dealhere. Our most recent episode of Inside Story takes a look at what might come after the deal between Hamas and Israel is implemented – if it goes ahead, of course. There has been some optimism, but one of the guests, Palestinian lawyer Diana Buttu, expressed some caution. “The problem is the bigger picture,” said Buttu. “The Israeli army is going to remain in the Gaza Strip; they’ve already indicated that people won’t be able to get back to the north, which means effectively ethnic cleansing, and it doesn’t mean that we’ve addressed the root causes.” So what’s next – a return to war, as Israel warns?

In what would be a setback for the Qatari-brokered truce deal between Israel and Hamas, Israeli media outlets are reporting that the truce will not begin on Thursday morning, as Hamas had earlier said, and would instead be delayed until details of the captive deal are finalised. The Times of Israel reported that a government source had said that it was not clear whether the head of Mossad – currently in Qatar – has received the names of the captives who were to be released on the first day of the truce. The source added that a truce document needed to be signed by both parties, which is expected to happen in the next 24 hours. Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, also reported that there would be “war tomorrow”. Haaretz said that there would be “no halt to the fighting in the Gaza Strip as long as there is no finalised timeline for the agreement with Hamas”. Al Jazeera cannot confirm the veracity of the reports. The medical service said 14 red crescent ambulances, two UN buses and other vehicles were involved in the evacuation of 190 wounded and sick people, as well as “a number of medical teams” from al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City to the south. However, the group said the evacuation lasted “for almost 20 hours as the convoy was obstructed and subjected to careful inspection” at an Israeli checkpoint. Three paramedics and a companion of a wounded person were detained, PRCS said. Two of the paramedics and the companion were released, while a third paramedic – identified as Awni Khattab – remains detained. PRCS has been documenting the obstruction and detainment throughout the day on social media.   This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said the ceasefire is still expected to begin at 10am (08:00 GMT) on Thursday, even after Israeli National Security Adviser Hanegbi said the captive release would not happen “before Friday”. “The Israeli media is reporting that there was some sort of delay, but they did not elaborate on the discussions, neither did the national security adviser,” she said. “But we do know that this deal has passed, it will go through. There will be that tentative temporary ceasefire that will start around 10am tomorrow, local time”. “As for the release of the captives that some were anticipating to start tomorrow, it will start on Friday instead,” she said.

US con­sid­ers re­des­ig­nat­ing Houthis as ‘ter­ror’ group af­ter ship seizure,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/us-considers-redesignating-houthis-as-terror-group-following-ship-seizure,"White House had reversed designation against rebel group in 2021 to help get aid to war-torn Yemen. The White House says it is considering redesignating Yemen’s Houthi rebels as a “terrorist” group afterthey claimedthe seizure of a commercial ship in the Red Sea. United States National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Tuesday condemned theseizure, calling it the “piracy of a ship in international waters”, and accused the Houthis of “recent targeting of civilians”. The Red Sea is home to one of the world’s most vital trade routes through theStrait of Hormuz. US President Joe Biden’s administration formally delisted the Houthis as a “foreign terrorist organization” and “specially designated global terrorists” in 2021, undoing a move by former President Donald Trump. The United Nations and aid groups had criticised the designations, saying their restrictions complicated aid deliveries to war-torn Yemen. The Houthis – an Iran-backed group that controls large swathes of northern Yemen and the capital, Sanaa – have carried out attacks on Israel in recent weeks,launching missilesand drone attacks and threatening to seize Israeli vessels in the Red Sea. Houthi forces raided a ship named Galaxy Leader on Sunday.  Houthi General Ali Al-Moshki said in later remarks on television: “Israeli ships are legitimate targets for us anywhere.”  This is a modal window.

Kirby called for their immediate and unconditional release and accused Iran of being complicit in such attacks. The raid, which analysts have said mirror tactics used by Iran, has raised alarm that the Houthis could step up such attacks in the Red Sea.

Pho­tos: In­tense Is­raeli air strikes hit Gaza amid grow­ing signs of truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/21/photos-intense-israeli-air-strikes-hit-gaza-amid-growing-signs-of-truce,"In Pictures Israel has kept up its relentless bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip amid growing signs that talks about a truce between Israel and Hamas are making progress. In Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of residents of the north have fled to escape Israeli bombing, neighbours said on Tuesday that an overnight strike on an apartment had killed seven people, mostly children. In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip and in Rafah in the south, Tuesday morning brought tragically familiar scenes of adults and children wounded in bombardments being rushed into overcrowded hospitals. The Hamas government press office said there was a communications blackout in Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip after an Israeli strike hit telecommunications towers. Israel has bombarded Gaza since October 7 after Hamas fighters carried out attacks that day on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 captive, according to Israeli officials. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the Israeli air and ground assault on Gaza, including 5,600 children, according to Palestinian officials. The leader of Hamas said a truce with Israel was close to being finalised, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped for good news soon about the captives in Gaza. The statements were the most optimistic signals so far of a deal to pause the war in Gaza and free prisoners. US President Joe Biden told reporters that an accord to release some of the people held by Hamas was near. “My team is in the region shuttling between capitals. We’re now very close, very close to bringing some of these hostages home very soon,” he said.",
BRICS con­demns Is­rael war on Gaza in sig­nal to the West,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/21/brics-condemns-israel-war-on-gaza-in-signal-to-the-west,"The grouping, which has previously focused on economic issues, called for an end to ‘war crimes’ in the Gaza conflict. Leaders of major emerging economiescalledfor an end to Israel’s war on Gaza on Tuesday, and for a cessation of hostilities on both sides to ease the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. In a virtual summit chaired by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, the BRICS grouping denounced attacks on civilians in Palestine and Israel, with many leaders calling the forced displacement of Palestinians, within Gaza or outside the territory, “war crimes.” “We condemned any kind of individual or mass forcible transfer and deportation of Palestinians from their own land,” a chair’s summary read. The group, which did not issue a joint declaration, also “reiterated that the forced transfer and deportation of Palestinians, whether inside Gaza or to neighbouring countries, constitute grave breaches of the Geneva conventions and war crimes and violations under International Humanitarian Law.” The BRICS is made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, all major emerging economies looking for a greater say in a global order long dominated by the United States and its Western allies. These countries are often viewed as leaders of what is referred to in international policy speak as the “Global South”. But it wasn’t just these five countries that spoke on the war on Tuesday. Earlier this year, the BRICS hadagreed to expandand add Egypt, Ethiopia, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran as members from 2024. The leaders of these six countries also participated in the meeting called by South Africa. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres joined the summit too. The chair’s summary — in essence a gist of the mood in the room — highlights growing calls from the Global South to end the war on the Gaza Strip. The conflict began after an October 7 attack on Israeli communities by the armed group Hamas that saw 1,200 people killed and 240 others taken hostage. In response, Israel has incessantly shelled Gaza, targeting hospitals, schools and refugee camps and killing more than 13,000 people, many of them children, in violation of international laws. Since then, millions of people across Africa, Asia and the Middle East have marched for a “Free Palestine” and called for a ceasefire. Experts in Africa and elsewhere have accused the United States, United Kingdom and European Union of hypocrisy for claiming to be  bastions of democracy and human rights while supporting Israel’s war in Gaza.

While the chair’s summary appeared “mild and somewhat balanced” according to Steven Gruzd, an analyst at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), some countries were more combative in their presentations. In his opening statement at the meeting, the current BRICS chair, President Ramaphosa of South Africa, said that Israel’s actions “are in clear violation of international law” and that the “collective punishment of Palestinian civilians by Israel “is a war crime … tantamount to genocide”. Ramaphosa also said Hamas had “violated international law and must be held accountable”. India’s stance was comparatively softer, with Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying there was “a need for restraint and immediate humanitarian support”, as well as “peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy”. Many of the member states, including Russia and Brazil, have previously criticised Israel’s non-stop bombardment and now, ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. China, for its part, this weekhosted a delegation of Muslim countries, officials and organisations seeking a ceasefire, including the Palestinian Authority (PA). India, though, has not been as vocal and has in factcracked downon pro-Palestine marches at home, seemingly siding with Israel and its biggest benefactor, the US, in what is seen as a split within the BRICS itself. But that split did not seem glaring at Tuesday’s summit, which experts say is a first-of-its-kind meeting for a group that has previously focused on economic issues. “I am not sure I recall a similar extraordinary summit being called,” Gruzd told Al Jazeera. “It does reflect on the growing assertiveness and confidence of the BRICS grouping, not waiting for the West. BRICS has generally shied away from political and security issues; this meeting goes against that trend.” Together, BRICS countries represent 40 percent of the world population and a quarter of the global economy. President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran – Israel’s archenemy – said Palestinians shouldhold a referendumto determine their fate. Still, many BRICS nations — not just India — have established ties with Israel that they will be wary of severing. China has huge investments in Israel, Gruzd notes, while India has even deeper historic ties with the country and enjoys military and technological partnerships with it. But with a fiery Iran set to join the group, India might not be able to influence how a new BRICS+ will react to Israel, Gruzd said. South Africa, currently the smallest BRICS country, and one that itself experienced oppressive apartheid rule for more than four decades, sees its own struggle reflected in that of the Palestinians and has consistently been one of the loudest calls for a ceasefire, said analysts. At the same time, it has long been Israel’s largest trade partner in Africa. On Tuesday, that relationship appeared to have reached a turning point. Parliament members voted to shut down the Israeli embassy in Pretoria, signifying a turning point in the crisis. Diplomats from the country had already been recalled from Israel on November 6. Israel recalled its ambassador to South Africa, Eliav Belotserkovsky, for “consultations” on Monday in response to Pretoria’s growing hostility. Alongside Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti last week, South Africa also submitted a referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate whether war crimes have been committed in Gaza.

On Monday, South African Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni applied further pressure, calling for an ICC warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, adding that it would be a “total failure” if the court did not investigate the leader. Earlier this year, South Africa had managed toconvinceRussia not to send  President Vladimir Putin to the annual BRICS Summit in August because of an ICC arrest warrant issued against him for war crimes committed in Ukraine. If Putin had attended the summit in South Africa, the country, an ICC signatory, would have been obligated to arrest him. Tuesday’s BRICS stance, instigated by South Africa, might push more countries to be vocal in denouncing the war, said Muhammed Desai of Africa4Palestine, an advocacy group. “South Africa is a significant economic and political powerhouse on the African continent as well as a country with one of the most embassies and high commissions in the world,” Desai said. “Thus, its stance and position does have clout within the diplomatic arena.” But the coalition’s political weight is not significant enough to have any real impact on the direction of Israel’s war, others say. “Frankly, I do not think they have much leverage on Israel directly,” said Gruzd of SAIIA. “I also do not think it will have much effect on the West, besides adding to voices calling for a ceasefire.” Their leverage is, however, growing. Dozens of nations have applied or shown interest in joining BRICS, a major reason for the expansion earlier this year, as countries seek to reduce their dependence on the US-led Western financial system. Russia, which will hold the group’s presidency in 2024, is expected to push to use local currencies for international trade payments, as opposed to the dominant US dollar. That platform, some say, is necessary for the voice of the Global South to be heard. “Within the global world order, BRICS offers another voice,” Desai of Africa4Palestine said, and “that is necessary to counter the current Western hegemonic view”.",

The action is largely symbolic because it will be up to PresidentCyril Ramaphosa‘s government whether to implement it. The motion calling for the closure of the embassy and suspension of all diplomatic relations until a ceasefire is reached passed on Tuesday with 248 votes in favour and 91 votes against.

Ramaphosa has said his country believes Israel is committing war crimes and genocide in the besieged Gaza Strip, where Palestinian authorities have said more than 14,100 people have been killed in Israel’s air and ground assault since October 7. The war in Gaza was triggered when the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel that authorities there said killedabout 1,200 people. The vote was held after Israel announced it was recalling Ambassador Eli Belotserkovsky from Pretoria “for consultations”. The African country, which has not had an ambassador in Israel since 2018, has long backed the Palestinian cause for statehood. Many Palestinian rights groups have drawn parallels between the Israeli occupation and South Africa’s decades-longapartheid regime. In recent years, a growing number of internationalrights groupshave said Israeli policies towards the Palestinians constitute the crime of apartheid, something that Israel firmly denies.

‘Is­rael’s army tanks are here. We are fac­ing im­mi­nent death in Gaza City’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/israels-army-tanks-are-here-we-are-facing-imminent-death-in-gaza-city,"In his last report before contact was lost on Monday, an Al Jazeera writer describes the terror on the ground. Gaza City– As I look out of the window this morning, the Israeli army’s tanks are just a few hundred metres away. They have apparently reached deep into the centre of Gaza City during the night. My two-year-old has only just fallen asleep beneath the window. Up all night and terrified by the sound of the gunfire, he has been living off powdered milk and cereal for the past four days – his lips are dry. In recent days, we have felt a growing sense that we will be unable to survive Israel’s bombardment much longer. Fear and deprivation have been our constant companions – we are struggling around the clock. My parents, in their 60s, have not taken their daily medication for more than a month. They’re defying horror and illness all at once. My attempts to go out and get their medication have all been a failure. Walking out to the pharmacy is no longer possible – both the pharmacy and the streets have been destroyed. Like hundreds of other families, we cannot leave Gaza City and go south – it is too dangerous. We are forced to stay by the relentless bombing of every major road leading to the south of the strip. At night, we men keep up a mask of fragile strength so the women and children might have some hope of feeling relatively secure. Really, we are all anxious and terrified. As the war jets hover overhead all night, the sound of the ground missiles fired from military tanks is even more terrifying: What if we are hit by one? The explosions are drawing closer by the minute, shaking the building. It can surely only be a matter of time before artillery hits our walls. If we are struck, it is most likely that all 30 of us, huddled together in a two-bedroom apartment – including children, elderly and fleeing neighbours – will be killed. Through the day, another form of torture rears its head, adding to the psychological warfare we are enduring. Thirst and hunger. We used to go out to find whatever we could – clean water or tinned food. For the past few days, however, our ability to move around the neighbourhood has become completely impossible. We have a stark choice – stay inside and hungry or risk being shot if we go out. If you can make it safely to an hours-long queue for clean water outside a humanitarian shelter, you are lucky. Anyone who gets the chance to bid farewell to their loved ones is even luckier. And, if you die without any suffering, you are the luckiest of all. Entire families have died during the ground invasion and have been discarded where they fell to bleed to death. There is no safety to be had anywhere – not in hospitals, churches, mosques or schools. What used to be the most beautiful places in Gaza are now the scenes of a horror movie. They have mostly been reduced to black debris. The Israeli ground incursions across the city centre have obliterated every facet of our lives. Not only is the fighting endangering our very lives but forces us to wrestle with the lack of food and water as well. Death is everywhere, so is destruction. Out on the streets, dead bodies lie on top of the rubble of destroyed buildings. Injuries receive no medical attention. All the health facilities and ambulance services are out of service. Hospitals have become a fighting ground as Israeli troops storm them, denying thousands of civilians their right to seek medical treatment. The military tanks deployed on the ground, along with snipers on high rises, have blanketed the city with fear and death. We await an imminent telecoms and internet blackout, leaving us in the dark soon enough. While we wait to be cut off, emergency services and civil defence crews, as well as ordinary citizens, make desperate attempts at communication with the outside. The news is hinting at a possible temporary truce, but we need a full ceasefire. For more than 40 days, life has become more and more dangerous and unbearable. Survival is our daily routine, and we are losing hope that we can continue for even a few more days. My family and I hope now, that if we are to die, we die peacefully. If we are to live, we want only to live peacefully too. Neither of these options seems likely right now.",
Hos­pi­tals in north­ern Gaza com­plete­ly out of ser­vice: Health of­fi­cial,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/hospitals-in-northern-gaza-completely-out-of-service-health-official,"Gaza’s health ministry spokesperson says occupancy rate in hospitals in the enclave’s north has reached 190 percent as they overflow with the wounded. Hospitals in northern Gaza are now completely out of service, according to the besieged enclave’s Ministry of Health. Ashraf al-Qudra, Gaza’s health ministry spokesperson, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Tuesday that the occupancy rate in hospitals in Gaza’s north has reached 190 percent. Israel bombed and destroyed parts of al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza, where more than 700 people are still held captive under a siege by the Israeli army, according to al-Qudra. Last week, Israeli forcesseized the hospitalto search for what they said was a Hamas tunnel network and command centre built underneath the complex. Hamas has denied the allegations. A group of 28premature babieswere evacuated from the al-Shifa Hospital to Egypt to receive treatment on Monday, according to the Palestinian authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Al-Qudra also said that about 120 people were evacuated from northern Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital to Nasser Medical Complex in the south of the Strip. There are still more than 400 injured people inside the Indonesian Hospital, in addition to about 200 medical staff and more than 2,000 others taking refuge, he added. The Israeli army has put those inside the hospital in a “circle of death”, targeting anybody who moves around the hospital or inside it, al-Qudra said. Gaza’s health ministry had said on Monday that at least 12 Palestinians werekilledand dozens wounded by attacks on the hospital funded by Jakarta, which is currentlysurroundedby Israeli tanks. The WHO said on the same day that the Indonesian Hospital was only able to provide basic services, with the lives of those with severe injuries and other medical emergencies being at immediate risk. Al-Qudra also said that Israeli air strikes targeted the house of Gaza’s deputy undersecretary of the health ministry on Tuesday morning, adding that there were 56 of his relatives in the house who had been displaced from different areas of Gaza. Rescue teams managed to find 17 bodies while the rest are still under the rubble, according to the spokesperson. Hospitals in northern Gaza and Gaza City have faced power outages due to a lack of fuel and Israeli attacks. They have also faced severe shortages of water, essential medicines and supplies as Israel continues its ground operations and air strikes on the enclave. The WHO says it has recorded 335 attacks on health complexes in the occupied Palestinian territory since October 7, the beginning of the Gaza war, including 164 attacks in the Gaza Strip and 171 attacks in the West Bank. These attacks have resulted in forced mass evacuations from hospitals, and multiple fatalities and casualties among patients, their companions, and displaced people taking refuge there, according to the WHO. At least 13,000 Palestinians – about 5,600 of them children and 3,500 women – have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its air and ground assault on Gaza after the October 7 attacks by Hamas targeting Israel, according to the enclave’s health ministry. Hamas and allied groups took about 240 captives during their incursion into southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.  This is a modal window.

Have the US and Is­rael agreed on Gaza’s fu­ture?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/have-the-us-and-israel-agreed-on-gazas-future,"Disagreements persist, but analysts say the US has shown no readiness to draw any red lines for Israel. Over the past couple of weeks, the United States has been setting out its vision for an endgame to Israel’s war on Gaza. If President Joe Biden is to be believed, his administration is aiming for the hitherto impossible: a bid to “end the war forever”. Writing in The Washington Post on Saturday, Biden spoke of reuniting the occupied West Bank and Gaza under thePalestinian Authority(PA) while working towards a two-state solution. He set out basic principles for achieving peace, including “no forcible displacement” of Palestinians, “no reoccupation, no siege or blockade, and no reduction in territory”, insisting the “work must start now”. All this seemed quite promising on paper, but the words coming from Tel Aviv were rather different. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had already airedplansfor “an overriding and overreaching Israeli military envelope” in post-war Gaza, rejecting the idea of the PA taking over the enclave. With $14.3bn in US aid fast-tracking its way to Israel’s military, it seemed the war was not over just yet. The US and Israel are no strangers to mixed messaging. Here’s a breakdown of how things work in this bilateral relationship and what it means for Gaza: Three days after Hamas fighters burst through the Gaza border fence on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 240 captives, Biden signalled hisstaunch supportfor Israel. He alluded to the “laws of war” – a reference that would come back to haunt the US administration as Israel’s air and ground counterattack on the strip deepened – killing more than 13,000 people at the time of writing. “The initial response of the US was unsurprising, given the horrific nature and scale of the Hamas attack,” said Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace. “What came next, though, was almost like wilful ignorance.” Shortly after, Biden appeared to go off message. He said he had seen photos of babies beheaded by Hamas, claims laterwalked backby a White House spokesperson. As the bombs rained down on Gaza, he questioned the Palestinian death toll – figures that UN agencies, based on past evaluations, saw no reason to disbelieve. A month into the war, there was a shift in tone. By that point, more than25,000 tonnesof explosives had been dropped on Gaza, far exceeding the destructive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and pressure was mounting from progressives in the divided Democrats and international actors to rein in Israel. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said he had seen his “own children” in the images of dead Palestinian kids, appeared topush backon Netanyahu’sassertionthat Israel would be responsible for security in the enclave for an “indefinite period” after the war. In a speech on the sidelines of a Group of Seven summit in Tokyo, he said Palestinian voices would be “at the centre” of post-crisis governance in Gaza. There would, however, be a “transition” and “mechanisms” for security, said Blinken. Would a multinational Arab force step in to control Gaza during a transitional period, paving the way for the PA? Or would that sizeable role be fulfilled by Israel for what could well turn out to be an “indefinite period”? To this day, the question remains moot. After Blinken’s speech, Netanyahu appeared to partlyacquiesceto the US game plan, saying his country did not intend to “occupy” the strip after the end of the war. Many pointed out that Israel had never stopped occupying the territory after its withdrawal in 2005, exercising effective control through an ongoing land, air and sea blockade. But, in an interview with CNN, the Israeli prime minister made it clear he would not be handing over control to the PA. “There has to be a reconstructed civilian authority,” he said of the PA. “There has to be something else.”  At a news conference, he took issue with the PA’s school syllabus, which he claimed fuelled hatred of Israel, and its payments to families of imprisoned Palestinians. As Israel’sforced displacementand repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure – includinghospitals– have unfolded in real time on social media, a bigger question is being asked. Does Israel actually want any Palestinians left in the strip at all? “At this point, that’s very clearly coming across from senior public Israeli figures who’ve been using genocidal and ethnic cleansing language from day one,” Friedman said. The bar for proving genocidal intent is notoriously high, but Israeli politicians and officials have already provided an extensive catalogue of incendiary rhetoric for investigators. Last month, Netanyahu himself invoked the “Amalek”, a nation in Judaic scripture that the Israelites were instructed to exterminate in an act of revenge. Hitting new extremes, Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu was suspended this month for saying thatdropping a nuclear bomb on Gazamight actually be an option. “Even before this conflict began, the relationship was increasingly fraught because Israel had the most right-wing extremist government in its history,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who served as an analyst and negotiator at the US Department of State between 1978 and 2003. Earlier this year, Netanyahu had defied Biden’s instructions to slow down his controversial emasculation ofIsrael’s judiciary, widely criticised not only as an attempt to shield himself from corruption charges, but also as a tactic for speeding up annexation of the West Bank. However, the pair go back a long way, their relationship waxing and waning through the crises of the past four decades. Miller believes the “operating system” of the US-Israeli relationship is still intact, partly owing to Biden’s deep relationship with Israel, engrained in his political DNA. As he points out, Biden is a self-described Zionist. Still, on the domestic front, the US president faces pressures on the left and the right of the political spectrum, with Democrats like New York’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling on him to take action to stop the war. The Republicans, meanwhile, have emerged as what Miller dubs the “Israel-can-do-no-wrong party”. With next year’s election on the horizon, Biden is feeling the squeeze. On the war, Miller believes Israel and the US are “in a pretty serious bind on all of the critical issues”, including the prevention of Palestinian deaths, redeeming the hostages (10 of whom are American citizens), addressing the humanitarian crisis “that will not be resolved through short pauses”, and, ultimately, constructing a credible political process. But they won’t be falling out any time soon. “At what point would the administration impose serious costs and consequences on Israel and make it unmistakably clear that unless it changes its tactics and strategies, it’s going to have an extremely deleterious impact on the US-Israeli relationship?” Miller said. “I’m not sure it would come to that point.” In his op-ed last weekend, Biden stated he would be resuscitating the moribund two-state solution. While reiterating his staunch support for Israel, he hinted at a more even-handed approach, mentioning visa sanctions for hardliner settlers attacking and displacing Palestinians in the West Bank. Noura Erakat, associate professor at Rutgers University and author of Justice for Some: Law and the Question of Palestine, is sceptical. “The US presents itself as an honest broker,” she said. “And yet what we’ve seen again and again, especially since 1967, is the US talking out of both sides of its mouth. “Out of one side of its mouth, it insists that it wants to see a two-state solution, but on the other side it provides Israel with the unequivocal military, diplomatic and financial support to expand its settler colonial ambitions and to entrench its projects.” As Israel’s biggest military backer, there are few lengths to which the US will not go to defend its ally. The $14.3bn in military aid that  Congress rushed through to replenish Israel’s missile defence systems and military equipment after October 7 top up the $3.8bn in annual military assistance the US provides under a 10-year plan that began in 2016. It is this iron-clad alliance that has enabled what Erakat calls “a framework of derivative sovereignty whereby Palestinians have some jurisdiction over themselves and some land but not meaningful sovereignty”. Since at least 1983, the US hassystematically protectedIsrael, vetoing successive United Nations Security Council resolutions condemning its expansion of settlements, which have left Palestinians crowded into isolated fragments of territory reminiscent of the Bantustans of apartheid-era South Africa. The trend exploded under Netanyahu, whosebrazen expansionismwas boosted by Donald Trump’s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, the former US president megaphoning to the world that this city of shared Muslim, Christian and Jewish religious sites was now the Israeli capital. Friedman argues that Netanyahu, re-elected for a record fifth time in November 2022, has effectively been “trained” by successive US administrations to run through red lines. “He believes, so far correctly, that he enjoys total impunity,” she said. At the beginning of the war, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant predicted: “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything.” Nearly seven weeks in, UN agencies report that nearlyhalf the enclave’s homeshave been damaged or destroyed, 390,000 jobs have been lost, and 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, squeezed into the southern half of the strip. With much of the north in ruins and Israel almost certain to prolong ablockadethat has seen imports of construction materials heavily restricted, Friedman wonders whether displacement in the south will become the new status quo. “We’ll have a strip in the strip, which will just be a giant Palestinian refugee camp under security control of Israel, with the international community providing food and water. But there will be no chance of anyone developing any kind of life,” she said. “I don’t see a quick or easy end to this,” Miller said. “And even if the Israelis come to the conclusion that they’ve done everything they possibly can to weaken and undermine Hamas, they’re still not going to leave Gaza unless there is someone or something that it can be left to. “Right now, the headlines look bad, and the trend lines look even worse.”",
Is­raeli strike kills three jour­nal­ists near Lebanon bor­der,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/israeli-strike-kills-three-journalists-near-lebanon-border,"Al Mayadeen TV said an Israeli attack ‘deliberately’ targeted its correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Me’mari. An Israeli bombardment of southern Lebanon has killed three journalists, according to Lebanese media, as hostilities grow along Israel’s northern border. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported on Tuesday that an “enemy bombing” killed three people in the Tayr Harfa area, about 1.6km (1 mile) from the Israeli frontier. Lebanese channel Al Mayadeen TV said two of its staff were among the victims. The third person killed was said to be a local journalist and “contributor” to the channel. “Correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Me’mari were killed by an Israeli attack,” Al Mayadeen said in a statement. “It was a direct attack, it was not by chance,” Al Mayadeen director Ghassan bin Jiddo said, noting it came after an Israeli government decision this month to block access to the channel’s website. “Another attack has targeted journalists in southern Lebanon, killing a reporter and a cameraman who worked for the pan-Arabic channel Al Mayadeen … A third person, who was with them, was also killed,” said Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from southern Lebanon. “The feeling here is that the Israeli army wants to silence the media and punish journalists,” our correspondent said.  IsraelblacklistedAl Mayadeen TV last week, accusing it of “wartime efforts to harm [Israel’s] security interests and to serve the enemy’s goals”. Israel’s Minister of Communications Shlomo Karhi said on October 13 he had begun work to block Al Mayadeen’s websites and programming and shut down its local offices. “The Lebanese information minister has asked the army to open an investigation into [the attack on Tuesday],” Khodr said, adding that this was the third attack against journalists in southern Lebanon since October 13. The Israeli military said it was “looking into the details” of the incident, the AFP news agency reported. The latest killings add to at least 50 reporters and media workers whohave been killedamid Israel’s 46-day war in Gaza, according to press freedoms group, the Committee to Protect Journalists. The vast majority of the killed journalists are Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. Since October 7, when Israel waged its war in Gaza following Hamas’s attack on Israeli territory, there have been repeated confrontations between the Israeli army and Hezbollah on the Israel-Lebanon border. So far, the fighting has killed 70 Hezbollah fighters, 13 Lebanese civilians, seven Israeli troops and three Israeli civilians, in what is the worst escalation since 2006. ",

"Hamas, Is­rael lead­ers sug­gest deal is ‘close’ on cap­tives, Gaza truce",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/gaza-approaching-a-truce-agreement-with-israel-hamas-leader-haniyeh,"Qatar-mediated deal could see Hamas exchange captives for Palestinian prisoners; US President Biden says ‘we’re now very close’. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has said a truce deal with Israel was close and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped for “good news soon” about captives held by the Palestinian group, even as Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip has continued unabated. After weeks ofwar in the Gaza Strip, US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday of the talks mediated by Qatar: “We have been working on getting hostages out for weeks. We’re now very close.” “We could bring some of those hostages home soon, but nothing is done until everything is done,” he said. Haniyeh said Hamas officials delivered their response to Qatari mediators in the ongoing talks, according to the Reuters news agency. The statement gave no more details, but Hamas official Ezzat el-Reshiq told Al Jazeera that negotiations were centred on how long the ceasefire would last, arrangements for delivery of aid into Gaza and the exchange of Israeli captives held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Both sides will free women and children and details will be announced by Qatar, he said. The agreement will include a ceasefire, arrangements for aid trucks to supply all areas in Gaza, and the transfer of the injured to other countries for treatment, according to el-Reshiq.

Hours later, Netanyahu appeared to temper expectations, saying that Israel will continue its war against Hamas, even if a temporary ceasefire is reached to release captives. An unnamed US official who spoke to Reuters said the agreement being discussed would see the release of 50 Hamas-held captives, mostly women and children, in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners and a pause in fighting of four or five days. Netanyahu was convening with his war cabinet, security cabinet and full government in consecutive meetings to discuss whether to accept a proposed short-term truce deal that would see some captives released, as well as Palestinian prisoners. In comments ahead of an expected cabinet vote on a ceasefire proposal, Netanyahu vowed to press ahead. “There is nonsense talk outside that after returning our abductees we will stop the war,” he said. “So I want to clarify: We are at war, we will continue to be at war, we will continue to be at war until we reach all our goals. We will destroy Hamas, we will return all our abductees and the missing and we will ensure that in Gaza there won’t be any party that poses a threat to Israel,” he said. He added any pause will allow Israel’s military to “re-prepare” for fighting. Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have opposed the deal. Both are members of Israel’s security cabinet and main government cabinet. Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said it was “fully expected that this deal will be approved”. “They have said that what the Israeli military has been doing in Gaza has been effective, that that’s how this deal has been reached – but they opposed any kind of Palestinian prisoner release,” Jamjoom said of Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. But “that is not enough of a vote to keep this vote from happening”, he added. According to Jamjoom, in terms of public sentiment, it remains unclear whether the deal is going to receive major backlash. “There is some concern that perhaps because Palestinian prisoners are being released, that [it] could cause some people to become upset,” he said. But Israeli officials have said they are “vetting these Palestinian prisoners very carefully”, he noted.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

Talk of an imminent deal on captives has been circulating for days as Qatari mediators sought the agreement for Hamas and Israel to exchange captives for prisoners in return for a temporary ceasefire that would boost emergency aid shipments to Gaza civilians. Last week, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for “urgent and extendedhumanitarian pausesand corridors throughout the Gaza Strip” to allow for aid delivery and medical evacuations after four failed attempts to respond to the Israel-Hamas war. The UN chief, Antonio Guterres, said on Monday that the world was witnessing an “unparalleled and unprecedented” level of civilian death in Gaza compared with any other conflict since he became the international organisation’s secretary-general in 2017. “What is clear is that we have had in a few weeks thousands of children killed, so this is what matters,” Guterres said in New York while presenting a new UN environmental report. The government media office in Gaza released updated casualty figures on Tuesday since Israel launched its air and ground assault on Gaza after the October 7 attacks by Hamas targeting Israel. More than 14,128 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, including at least 5,600 children and 3,550 women. At least 33,000 people have been injured, it said, while more than 6,800 people are missing, either trapped under rubble or dead and not yet identified. Hamas and allied groups took about 240 captives during their incursion into southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.  This is a modal window.

Analy­sis: How Is­rael could gain from a pause in the Gaza war,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/analysis-how-israel-could-gain-from-a-pause-in-the-gaza-war,"A break in hostilities could benefit Israel militarily, even though it could hurt Prime Minister Netanyahu politically. Claims and denials of a potential ceasefire in Gaza continue. Some reports refer to athree-day pause in fighting, while others extend the truce to a full five days. Still, others claim the ceasefire could begin imminently. And so on. Even statements from the horse’s mouth differ. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied the report published by The Washington Post on Saturday that a tentative deal had been reached; a United States representative confirmed that talks were continuing but that a breakthrough was still awaited. On Sunday,Qatar’s Prime MinisterSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani announced in Doha that the differences remaining between Hamas and Israel were “very minor”. Qatar has been central to mediation efforts in the war, including for the release of Israeli captives. The last to be heard on the subject was Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh who on Tuesday told Reuters news agency that the parties are “close to reaching a truce agreement”. Another Hamas official told Al Jazeera that negotiations were centred on the duration of the truce, details of aid delivery to Gaza and the exchange of hostages and prisoners. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. With most parties involved looking to temporarily halt the carnage in Gaza, one must hope for the small step to a temporary respite. It is also prudent to examine why the two warring sides are considering such a hiatus. While such a pause would benefit Hamas politically, militarily there seems to be no obvious gain — as I’ll explain on Wednesday. For Israel, on the other hand, pausing the war could be advantageous from a military point of view and disadvantageous from a political one. The Israeli war machine has been going at full strength for six weeks in the air and three weeks on the ground in Gaza. Since the Hamas attacks, Israel’saerial bombardmenthas continued at a surprisingly high rate. It was clear from day one that the primary purpose of such merciless pounding of Palestinian civilian targets was not military. Initially, many analysts believed that the intense aerial attacks served to demonstrate to the Israeli populace that the armed forces were doing something and that bombing would be eased once land forces moved in. Even a country that boasts of its preparedness for war needs to maintain substantial reserves of weapons and ammunition. Omar Bradley, a US Army general during World War II, once said “amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics”. Israeli forward commanders may be eager to continue pounding Gaza come what may, but the rear echelon has done the maths and does not like the result. There are reliable reports escaping the net of military secrecy that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) is running out of smart bombs. It is always difficult to judge the credibility of allegations in military matters. Sometimes an officer who is disillusioned with his side — especially when it is fighting outside its borders or inflicting heavy civilian losses — will anonymously leak crucial details. Several specialised online forums claim that the IAF, having expended more than 2,500 joint direct attack munition (JDAM) smart bomb kits over Gaza, has just 10 days of stocks remaining. Every military regulates how much ammunition must remain in reserve for emergencies. Exact figures are a guarded secret, but everything points to Israel’s quartermasters having sounded alarms, asking for urgent replenishment. Specialised military items can be bought to fill gaps. In 1973, when Israel was on the verge of running out of stocks fighting Syria, Egypt and their Arab allies, the US launched “Operation Nickel Grass”, the biggest military airlift in history. The US Air Force flew almost 1,000 tonnes of weapons and ammunition to Israel per day, for a total of more than 22,000 tonnes. That isbeing repeated now, albeit on a smaller scale. For the past two weeks, US C-17 transports have been landing regularly at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv and at Nevatim airbase in the Negev desert. Most aircraft fly in from the Ramstein airbase in Germany, where the US has warehouses full of “prepositioned stock” — equipment set aside for military emergencies. There is little doubt that heavier and less urgent supplies are beingshipped to Israel by sea. Among them will surely be replenishment rockets for the tracked version of the high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), the M270 multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) that saw heavy use in Gaza. In October, the US released its own missiles for the Iron Dome air defence system to Israel. Israel’s response to initial heavy Hamas rocket attacks and attacks from Hezbollah and the Houthis had depleted Israel’s stocks to such an alarming level that it requested all of the Tamir interceptor missiles that the US had bought and kept in Israel until deployment. The Israeli forces would also welcome a break in fighting to evaluate its tactics so far in light of its performance against Hamas tunnels. As many analysts have warned — me included — despite dogs, robots, ground-penetrating radars, and other technology, thetunnelscan be destroyed only once soldiers get inside. That is a bloody task, as was proven last week when four commandos were killed by an improvised explosive device after opening a tunnel cover. A few days ago, an unidentified Israeli officer briefing reporters embedded with the Israeli forces admitted, “We don’t want to go down there. We know that they left us a lot of side bombs.” London-based weekly The Jewish Chronicle reported on November 16 that standing orders were clear: “No one is allowed togo into a tunnel.” The Israeli forces must also look into the effectiveness of their allegedly sophisticated and specialised training in simulators of Gaza City. Some of the simulation assumptions based on 2009 and 2014 incursions into Gaza have proven not applicable in 2023. It will also have to analyse why so manyMerkava tanks, believed almost invincible, were incapacitated. Reliable reports indicate up to 30 have been destroyed or are too damaged to use. While the military would welcome three or five days of respite — but would likely not admit it — politicians would clearly see it as their loss. Netanyahu and his hawks have been staunchly against any pause so if they accept it now, the public will see it as their weakness, no matter how they try to justify bowing to international pressure. The fact that US President Joe Biden, notionally Israel’s closest ally, has put his weight behind securing a break must be rubbing salt into the Israeli PM’s wounds. If the agreed period without fighting is observed, which is always a big risk, Israeli politicians will face new pressure at its end; the world might ask, “If it was a success, why don’t you just extend it?” Netanyahu’s greatest nightmare would be to get to a point where he not only failed to destroy Hamas but de facto recognised it by negotiating, even if indirectly. Deprived of Gaza, fuming Israelis would certainly go for his political skin instead.",
"Pho­tos: Run­ning out of fuel, peo­ple in Gaza seek out tra­di­tion­al clay ovens",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/21/traditional-clay-ovens-in-demand-as-fuel-shortages-continue-in-gaza,"In Pictures Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip– The tantalising smell of burning firewood and freshly baked bread fills the air. Fifty-three-year-old Inshirah Salem al-Aqra will swear to anyone who will listen that food cooked in a wood-fired taboon is just so much richer in flavour. She has been building these traditional clay ovens for whoever wants them for a long time. Made from clay, animal dung and straw, the oven is moulded into shape by hand and left to dry in the sun. “People make mandi [slow-cooked chicken] in these ovens or bake bread,” the mother of 10 said. “In this war, everything is so hard. People need the taboons even to make a coffee or tea,” she added. Fuel and electricity blackouts across much of the Gaza Strip have pushed Palestinians back to tradition as they seek al-Aqra out as the one woman who can make them a taboon. This is now the only source of income for her family after Israeli forces burned her husband’s fishing boat last month. She has made and sold five ovens since last week, ranging in width from 50cm to 90cm (20 to 35 inches), more than she would have made in a month in the past. She has kept her old prices, explaining: “I don’t want to take advantage of people, especially during these times.” The smallest oven goes for 80 shekels ($21) and the largest for 150 ($40). The Gaza Strip’s only mill is unable to grind wheat due tofuel shortagesafter Israel imposed a total siege on the territory. Al-Aqra has opened her home to displaced women sheltering in nearby schools. “They bring me flour, so I can bake bread for them,” she said. “If I have clean water, I fill up their jerry cans too.” She hopes the war, which has killed 13,000 Palestinians and devastated the Gaza Strip, ends soon. “Enough,” she said. “We’ve lost so much. Enough already.”",
Keep­ing Gaza on­line: Tele­com he­roes risk life and limb un­der Is­rael’s bombs,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/keeping-gaza-online-gazas-telecom-heroes-risk-life-and-limb-under-israels-bombs,"Making a maintenance trip in Gaza now literally means taking your life into your own hands. Why do they do it? It was a little after 10 pm when Ahmad* was called by the Network Operation Centre at the Palestine Telecommunications Company (PalTel). It was the third week of Israel’s assault on Gaza and the main data centre in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City had lost power, threatening toshut off allcommunications in the area. To check on the centre, the PalTel electrician would have to make his way across the city during intense Israeli aerial bombardment, putting his life in danger. But he did not hesitate. He flagged down a passing ambulance, hoping it would provide him with a degree of safety from Israeli attacks. “I told the driver that if I could not restore the generator, people like him wouldn’t be able toreach injured civilians. We are no better nor less important than medical staff – a phone call can save lives,” Ahmad said. Once at the centre, Ahmad set to work. By 2am, he had repaired the generator, allowing the telecommunications network to keep operating. He decided to stay in the building until dawn, slipping out around the freshly fallen debris to go home during a lull in Israeli bombing. “Thank God my family was OK and I lived to see another day. This is my work and my life. … I do this every day,” he said. Ahmad’s tale has become almost routine among the 750 PalTel staff in Gaza who, despite living through bombing, displacement and death, risk life and limb to keep the telecoms network running. The cost ofkeeping Gaza connectedhas been high. At least five PalTel staff members in Gaza have been killed in Israeli attacks while many other staff members have lost family members, including wives and children. Samir*, one of the staff members killed, had spent 10 hours shuttling fuel between data towers before returning home. Just 15 minutes later, Samir and his brother were killed in an Israeli air raid on their building. Humanitarian workers and journalists have said the operation of communication networks in Gaza is essential forrescue servicesand fordocumenting the realityof conditions on the ground to the outside world. More than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. Videos of desperate family members and civil defence scrabbling through the rubble of bombed-out buildings to rescue civilians trapped underneath have inspired shock and horror the world over. On the first day ofits offensiveon Gaza on October 7, Israel cut electricity to the territory. Despite the lack of power and the constant bombing, Gaza’s telecoms network stayed operational for almost six weeks. The CEO of PalTel said this is because the company has been preparing for war for “over 15 years”, embedding emergency contingencies in its Gaza infrastructure at every step. “We have faced a lot of different incidents during the previous wars. We’re doing more protection than any other operator,” CEO Abdul Majeed Melhem told Al Jazeera. PalTel’s Gaza network was built during Israel’s siege of the enclave, which requires that each piece of equipment be approved by Israeli authorities before entering Gaza, making repairs difficult. Recurrent wars on Gaza and frequent bombing campaigns by Israel havedamaged civilianinfrastructure, so to brace itself for a sustained conflict like the current one, the telecoms network is built like no other. While most telecom networks bury their cables 60cm (about 2ft) underground, PalTel buries its cables up to 8 metres (26ft)  deep. In case the Israelis cut off electricity, its data centres in Gaza also have three layers of redundancy: generators, solar panels and batteries. The company has also developed emergency protocols to direct workers remotely from the occupied West Bank, and if severed communications make this impossible, Gazan staff are empowered to act autonomously. Despite all the redundancies and preparations, the sheer scale of bombings these past weeks has still crippled the network. About 70 percent of the mobile network has been taken offline. Solar panels have been rendered mostly useless either by being destroyed in attacks or covered in dust and debris. The relentless nature of the conflict is also weighing on staff, who are dogged by danger from their house to the field. Rabih*, a fibre optics technician, was called to repair a cable just metres from the border on October 15. Prior to going, he had to give an exhaustive list of the repair team’s names, the colour of their cars and registration numbers to the Israelis, because “a mistake could be deadly”. As Rabih and his team laboured for two hours to fix the cable, the buzz of a drone above him and the sounds of shelling intermingled with the sound of their excavator. “Any wrong move could mean being targeted. I cannot explain to my wife and kids why I do that or why I volunteer to go out during the war. My company doesn’t oblige me, but if someone can do it, it has to be me,” he said. Staff in the West Bank watch their colleagues in Gaza from afar with bated breath, hesitant to ask them to check on damaged equipment, knowing that a simple repair trip could cost them their lives. Gaza-based staff are under no obligation to go into the field, but most have been eager to volunteer despite the dangers. “It is very difficult to call my colleagues who are under bombardment and ask them to go out. I feel afraid that if one of them gets hurt, I will never forgive myself,” said Mohammed*, a worker in the Network Operation Centre in the West Bank. Mohammed’s role at the centre requires him to monitor problems in the network, ask workers to volunteer to repair them and stay on the phone with them to provide feedback on the repairs. The calls are nerve-racking, and both Mohammed and the worker in Gaza want the field visit to be resolved as quickly as possible. “I cannot imagine how these people have the courage to go out. Maybe if I were there, I wouldn’t do it. I don’t know if I would,” Mohammed said. No matter how many metres deep they dig or the number of solar panels they install, Gaza’s connections to the outside world ultimately relies on the Israelis. The cables that connect Gaza to the outside world run through Israel, and the country on at least two occasions has deliberately cut off the strip’s international communications. “It’s clear for us that it was cut off by a decision. What proves this is that we didn’t do anything to get it back,” Melhem said. Israel also controls fuel to Gaza, allowing a small trickle into Gaza on Friday after weeks of pressure from the United States. Described as a “drop in the bucket” by humanitarian groups, Israel announced that 120,000 litres (31,700 gallons) of fuel would be allowed into the territory every two days for use by hospitals, bakeries and other essential services. PalTel will also be given 20,000 litres (5,283 gallons) of fuel every two days for its generators. On Thursday, the company had announced it would go into a full telecoms blackout because its fuel reserves were exhausted for the first time during the current war. According to Mamoon Fares, the corporate support director at PalTel, the 20,000 litres provided “should be enough to operate a good part of the network”. However, Gaza’s telecoms network will still be at the mercy of Israel should it decide to cut off fuel deliveries or network services that run through its territory. Without the ability to communicate, the already dismal situation in Gaza would only further deteriorate. “No ambulances, no emergency services, no civil defence or humanitarian organisations can work without telecommunications,” Melhem said. * Names have been changed to protect the individuals’ safety.",
"Why Sin­ga­pore is ‘friend of all, en­e­my of none’ in Is­rael-Gaza war",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/why-singapore-is-friend-of-all-enemy-of-none-in-israel-gaza-war,"The tightly-controlled city-state has turned down protest requests and urged people not to display political symbols. Singapore– Since thewar erupted in Gaza, the tiny Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore has taken a stance of non-interference, reflecting a long-held foreign policy focused on being a “friend to all and enemy to none”. At a special parliamentary session earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wongexplainedthat Singapore’s “longstanding support for a two-state solution remains unchanged”, in that Palestinian people have the right to a homeland and that Israel has the right to live within secure borders. Singapore “consistently takes a principled position” in line with international law and support of global peace and security, Wong stressed. The country has come out strongly to condemn Hamas’s October 7 assault on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and some 200 taken captive, as “acts of terrorism”. But it has also condemned the rising death toll in Gaza, with the foreign ministry saying on Friday that it was “deeply concerned” about the humanitarian situation in the besieged enclave where more than 13,000 people have been killed since Israel’s bombardment began. In late October, Singapore was among the 120 countries voting in favour of aresolution to protect civiliansand uphold legal and humanitarian obligations during an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. Singapore’s approach is “premised on the faithful observance of international law, especially the independence and sovereignty of nation-states,” said political analyst and Singapore Management University (SMU) associate law professor Eugene Tan. Tan told Al Jazeera there was “no contradiction” in Singaporeans empathising with the plight of the Palestinians and taking the stance that the attacks on Israel cannot be justified. At the same time, it is “also possible to support Israel’s right to defend itself and for Israel to avail itself of the use of force to protect its legitimate interests but also demand that Israel’s response must be consistent with the rules and requirements of public international law so that the safety, security and wellbeing of civilians are safeguarded,” he said. “What the debate in parliament demonstrated is that Singaporeans can hold very strong views on the tragedy unfolding in the Middle East region and yet come to a consensus on how Singapore and Singaporeans should respond… In short, Singapore firmly believes that Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace, security and dignity.” Still, unlike many countries around the world, there have been no public protests in favour of either the Palestinians or Israel in Singapore. Singapore – with a mostly ethnic Chinese population but also with a sizeable ethnic Malay-Muslim minority as well as ethnic Indians – has long prioritised preserving social cohesion and religious harmony. The city-state came into being on August 9, 1965, after it separated from Malaysia, forming “the backdrop to Singapore’s commitment on the right to self-determination in accordance with international law”, said Tan. Given “heightened sensitivities” surrounding the latest conflict, the Singapore government, which allows protests only by citizens and only in the  so-called “Speakers’ Corner” in the city centre, has argued that strong preemptive measures are necessary to manage the situation, citing the risk to public safety as well as security concerns. Authorities rejected five applications to use the Speakers’ Corner for events related to the Israel-Hamas war in October, despite having allowed rallies during a previous war in 2014. It has alsowarnedagainst the public display of foreign national emblems relating to the conflict and told people to be careful about supporting fundraising activities. “My hunch is that the current situation is a lot more sensitive and emotive than in 2014, and it involves terrorist acts by Hamas,” Tan said. “I would say it is more a case of not importing foreign issues that will only create social divisions.” Singaporean community organiser Zaris Azira was feeling helpless watching the news about Gaza on her phone, when she came across a video of thousands of Malaysians chanting for Palestine in their football stadium. The 30-year-old felt motivated to do something more. Azira applied for a permit to organise a rally at the Speakers’ Corner and found that “interest exploded”, with 740 people registering their interest to attend in less than a day. She also released a petition for Singaporeans to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, drafted in consultation with local political observer Walid J Abdullah. As of November 20, it had 26,280 signatures. Expressing disappointment at the rejection of her application, Azira said she was not surprised, given Singapore is “generally quite risk-averse as a nation, and I understand the desire to avoid any situation that could potentially spiral out of hand”. Singaporean activism has tended to the more subtle. On social media, people have joined campaigns such as the #freewatermelontoday campaign or the #weargreenforpalestine movement. An underground movement also emerged for people to show up at the Raffles Place MRT train station in green and say a prayer for Palestine, while others have taken pictures with awatermelon slice, which has become a symbol of Palestinian solidarity. “More and more, people want to show their solidarity with the people of Palestine, who are going through such unspeakable horrors on a daily basis. Singaporeans need an outlet to demonstrate safely, legally and powerfully,” Azira said. Local journalist and activist Kirsten Han expressed similar views in her newsletter We The Citizens, arguing that clamping down on freedom of expression and assembly would affect Singaporeans’ ability to participate in nuanced and important conversations. Calling the warnings and restrictions “infantilising”, she said: “We need civil society involvement, well-facilitated discussions, opportunities to educate ourselves and organise in non-violent ways for justice and human rights.” Han added that the ability to be together in a physical space can “also be incredibly powerful in helping people process the devastation we’re seeing in the news every single day.” In contrast, SMU’s Tan argues that the authorities’ move was prudent because of the potential for such actions to “detrimentally affect our hard-earned social cohesion and harmony”. “Protests make for good social media posts and rabble-rousing but will not move the needle on the conflict,” he said. In the absence of public protests, Singaporean civil society and faith communities have instead devoted their efforts to organising humanitarian aid for Gaza. As of November 14, about 6 million Singapore dollars ($4.5m) have been donated by the public through the non-profit Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF). Elsewhere, disaster relief organisation Relief Singapore has put out an urgent call for blankets, receiving about 2,500 to date. The blankets will be sent to the Gaza Strip, where winter temperatures can drop as low as 13C (55.4F). “While we are aware of the politics involved in the conflict, our focus is on the most pressing humanitarian needs,” said Relief Singapore director Jonathan How. “We know the vulnerable may die of cold as winter approaches in a city that looks more like an earthquake zone. We hope that more people will step up to lend their support in this crisis.” Ultimately, in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Singapore has key national security priorities linked directly to stable relations with its closest neighbours, according to Arvind Rajanthran, an associate research fellow with the National Security Studies Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University. Its next-door neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia have “Malay-Muslim majorities that frequently experience more politically charged atmospherics from the antagonism between the Israelis and Palestinians”, said Rajanthran. Both countries have seen large demonstrations in support of Gaza. So, it was significant that at the 10th Singapore-Malaysia Leaders’ Retreat held on  October 30, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim agreed that their different diplomatic positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should not affect the bilateral relationship, Rajanthran pointed out. Singapore’s “friend to all” approach to foreign policy appears to have allowed it to establish longstanding good relations with both Palestine and Israel. The government has committed substantial technical assistance and support to the Palestinian Authority, which controls the occupied West Bank, over the years, and will continue to do so, Deputy Prime Minister Wong said in parliament. Meanwhile, Israel helped build up the Singapore Armed Forces during Singapore’s early years and Singapore continues to cooperate closely with the country in many areas, including in science and technology, he said. In his speech to parliament, Wong said regional internet traffic on hardline sites had increased threefold since the start of the Israel-Gaza war. “We have also observed an uptick in anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore by regional extremist elements online,” he said. Islamophobia and anti-Semitism have also increased. In October, police received eight reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at Jewish or Muslim people in Singapore, Wong noted. This was equal to the total number of reports on anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim conduct that police received from January to September. Being a small state, Singapore has “little choice” but to continue its policy of non-state interference, said political scientist Antonio Rappa, an associate professor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). To take the side of Israel would risk antagonising Singapore’s local Muslim community unnecessarily, while supporting Palestine would betray Israel – an “unwritten ally” of Singapore since the days of its founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, said Rappa, who is head of the security studies programme at SUSS’s business school. Singapore has had close diplomatic ties with Israel since its independence in 1965, while Muslim-majorityIndonesia, Malaysia and Brunei have no formal diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv. On the strict controls taken by the government to clamp down on public rallies, Rappa explained that Singapore has been operating within a climate of fear for decades. Pointing to the idea of a garrison state, Singapore still has a “fortress-like” mentality that persists today, especially as a Chinese-majority nation surrounded by larger mostly-Muslim countries, which might “create a certain degree of tension”. “Still, it is not wise for us to bring in other people’s problems and import it into our country and create tensions within the population. We don’t want animosity and chaos created for Singapore,” he said.",

The Israeli military has conducted nightly raids across the occupied West Bank since the war in Gaza began. We’ll bring you more on what’s happening in Tulkarem when we can. The US outlet Politico reported that, despite the information provided by the Biden administration, Israel continued to strike the humanitarian sites. Washington sent GPS coordinates of medical facilities, including al-Shifa Hospital, and gave Israel information on the movement of aid groups, according to three people familiar with the messages. “Israel’s continued bombardment of these humanitarian facilities raises more questions about whether Washington has the political sway many in the administration want with Israel,” the article said.

In the aftermath of Hamas’s attack on October 7, Israel embarked on a violent, bloody campaign against the Palestinian people. The residents of Gaza have borne the brunt of it, with more than 14,000 people killed by indiscriminate Israeli bombardment, including more than 5,500 children. The onslaught has extended to the West Bank as well, where the Israeli army and settlers are carrying out raids and killing civilians daily; more than 200 have been murdered, thousands detained and scores tortured. Palestinian citizens of Israel, too, have been subjected to arrests, harassment and economic retribution through dismissals from jobs. But the ongoing violence is not meant to quench the thirst for “vengeance”, as some have suggested. It is systematically moving towards a long-term goal: the complete erasure of Palestinian existence within historic Palestine. This plan was in the workings already even before October 7; it has now simply been accelerated. Read morehere. There has been a huge erosion of support for Israel’s war in Gaza in the US, Nura Sediqe of Michigan State University tells Al Jazeera, especially among younger voters aged 18 to 34. Citing polls, she said that a majority of voters in this age group disapprove of both Israel’s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks and of the US sending more military aid to Israel. Turning to the upcoming US elections, she spoke about the large Arab and Muslim population of Michigan, a swing state that could be critical to Biden’s re-election hopes. “Biden won Michigan by a slim margin” in 2020, she said, meaning he’ll need every last vote next year. But among the state’s large Muslim population, a recent poll shows that “95 percent disapproved of his handling of the current situation in Gaza”. As far as how the seemingly imminent Hamas captive release deal will affect Biden’s standing with the US public, Sediqe said that many are in support of a full ceasefire and that the pause in fighting contained in the current deal may not be enough to satisfy them. If the Israeli government approves the Qatari-mediated deal, we can expect a process to begin – but that doesn’t necessarily mean an immediate release of captives or a pause in the bombing. Once the Israeli cabinet votes and if it passes the deal, a message is expected to be sent to Qatar, which will then announce the deal. But that will only lead to the beginning of a 24-hour period in which any Israeli opposed to the deal can appeal the decision to the Israeli High Court. No prisoners or captives will be released during this period. It is likely that the first round of the exchange will then take place on Thursday or Friday. Some 50 Israeli captives – women and children – are expected to be released over a span of five days. About 140 Palestinian prisoners – women and children – are also expected to be released over a span of several days. Political sources have told Israel’s Channel 13 that throughout all of this, displaced Palestinians in Gaza will not be able to head back to the the north to check on their homes.

Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem The Israeli prime minister, speaking alongside his war cabinet, wanted to stress that even though this deal was likely going to happen, it does not mean an end to the fighting, nor an end to the war. He said that after these days of pauses, as stipulated in the agreement, are over, the fighting will continue, and that the days that they are not striking will actually be a time for the Israeli army to recuperate themselves, so they can have more battle and attack plans going forward. But the deal doesn’t come without some opposition. Ministers on the far-right are opposing the deal and saying that they will not vote for it. The country’s Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have both said that this is “bad for Israel’s security”. They wanted the deal to be on Israel’s terms and believe that there were perhaps too many concessions given in the form of the release of Palestinian prisoners. Jordanian Prime Minister Bisher Khasawneh said the country would resort to “all the means in its power” to prevent Israel from implementing any transfer policy to expel Palestinians en masse from the occupied West Bank. The Israel-Gaza war has piqued longstanding fears in Jordan of further forced displacement of Palestinians. Jordan is already home to a large population of Palestinian refugees. “Any displacements or creating the conditions that would lead to it, Jordan will consider it a declaration of war and constitutes a material breach of the peace treaty,” Jordanian state media quoted Khasawneh as saying, referring to a 1994 pact between Jordan and Israel. “This would lead to the liquidation of the Palestinian cause and to harming the national security of Jordan,” Khasawneh said. Jordan in 1994 became the second Arab country after Egypt to sign a peace accord with Israel, but relations have plummeted amid the rise of what is widely considered Israel’s most right-wing government in its history.

Pho­tos: Pre­ma­ture ba­bies evac­u­at­ed from Gaza to Egypt amid Is­raeli at­tacks,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/20/photos-dozens-of-premature-babies-evacuated-from-gaza-to-egypt,"In Pictures A group of 28premature babiesfrom Gaza have been evacuated from a hospital inside the besieged Palestinian enclave to Egypt to receive treatment, according to Egyptian television footage and a Palestinian hospital doctor. “The babies arrived to me from al-Shifa Hospital. They were in a catastrophic condition when they got here,” said Dr Mohammad Salama, head of the neonatal unit at Al-Helal Al-Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah in southern Gaza. Last week, Israeli forces seizedal-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical facility in Gaza, to search for what they said was a Hamas tunnel network and command centre built underneath the complex. Hamas has denied the allegations. Medical staff on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing were seen on Monday carefully picking up babies from inside ambulances and placing them in mobile incubators, which were then wheeled across a car park towards other ambulances. The babies, from a total of 31 who were moved on Sunday from the besieged al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City to the maternity hospital in Rafah as a first step towards evacuation, wore only nappies and tiny green hats. “The 28 babies have now safely arrived in Egypt. Three babies still remain at the Emirati Hospital and continue to receive treatment,” a World Health Organization spokesperson said in an emailed response to the Reuters news agency. Asked about the babies’ conditions, he said: “All babies are fighting serious infections and continue needing healthcare.”",
Group of 28 pre­ma­ture Gaza ba­bies evac­u­at­ed to Egypt amid Is­raeli at­tacks,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/dozens-of-premature-babies-evacuated-from-gaza-to-egypt,"Group of 28 infants evacuated from the besieged al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City arrive in Egypt. A group of 28premature babieshas been evacuated from al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged Gaza Strip and taken to Egypt for urgent treatment as Palestinian officials say Israeli forces have attacked another hospital in northern Gaza. The newborns had been patients at al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest medical facility, where several others had died after their incubators stopped working for a lack of fuel as medical services collapse during the Israeli military’s ground and air assault on Gaza City. The babies were transported on Sunday to Al-Helal L-Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah in southern Gaza, so their condition could be stabilised before making the trip to Egypt through the Rafah border crossing on Monday. “Three babies still remain at the Emirati hospital and continue to receive treatment,” a World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson told the Reuters news agency. “All babies are fighting serious infections and continue needing health care.” Last week, Israeli forces seizedal-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical facility in Gaza, to search for what they said was a Hamas tunnel network and command centre built underneath the complex. Hamas has denied the allegations. During the Israeli operation, hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people left al-Shifa at the weekend and moved to the southern Gaza Strip. Since al-Shifa doctors have raised the alarm about the situation at the hospital for premature babies and the lack of clean water and medicines in the neonatal ward, eight infants have died, according to hospital officials. At another hospital in northern Gaza,at least 12 people were killedby artillery fire on Monday and dozens wounded, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. The ministry said hundreds of people were trapped at the facility, which was encircled by Israeli tanks. Reporting from the hospital, journalist Anas al-Sharif described the scenes inside as “chaotic”. “There is an overwhelming state of panic among patients,” he told Al Jazeera. “Victims are piling up on the floor.” The WHO’s chief said the United Nations agency was “appalled” by the attack on the Indonesian Hospital. “Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and especially while inside a hospital,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X, formerly Twitter.  Indonesia’s foreign minister condemned the attack on the hospital, which was built in 2016 and funded by Indonesia, and called it a “clear violation of international humanitarian laws”. “All countries, especially those that have close relations with Israel, must use all their influence and capabilities to urge Israel to stop its atrocities,” Retno Marsudi said. “We are very concerned about the fate of our colleagues and the fate of wounded and patients as well as [displaced] people who may have still [been] sheltering there. No ambulances can reach them, and we’re afraid the wounded will die,” said Nahed Abu Taaema, director of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza. Like most hospitals and clinics in the northern half of the Gaza Strip, the Indonesian Hospital has largely ceased operations but is sheltering patients, staff and displaced people who have sought shelter at the site after Israel launched its assault on Gaza last month. As fighting continues between Israeli forces and Hamas in Gaza, US and Israeli officials said a Qatari-mediated deal to free some of the captives held in the Palestinian enclave and pause fighting temporarily to enable aid deliveries to stricken civilians was edging closer. About 240 hostages were taken during a deadly assault on southern Israel by Hamas on October 7. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, according to Israeli tallies. After the attack, Israel promised to topple the armed group, which has governed Gaza since 2007, and it launched a devastating bombardment and ground offensive on Gaza. At least 13,000 Palestinians have been killed, including at least 5,500 children, according to Palestinian officials.",
Analy­sis: Can the US and Is­rael stop the Houthis from seiz­ing more ships?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/analysis-can-the-us-and-israel-stop-the-houthis-from-seizing-more-ships,"Short of risking an escalation, there’s only one reasonable way the US can accomplish this — by quietly taking Iran’s help. On Sunday, Houthi fightershijacked a cargo shipin the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen. The 189-metre-long (620ft-long) Galaxy Leader car carrier, travelling from Turkey to India, was intercepted by small fast boats and boarded by uniformed, armed personnel. Other people rappelled from a helicopter to the deck, ordering the crew to alter course to the Yemeni port of Hodeida. No shots were fired, and the seized ship is a civilian vessel sailing between neutral countries, but the incident still has the potential to trigger a serious escalation in the latest Israel-Palestine conflict. In the worst-case scenario, it could be the first move in drawing the United States and Iran into direct involvement in the war. Houthi spokesman Yahya Sare’e confirmed that the ship was seized for “being Israeli-owned” in line with his earlier announcement that the group would “not hesitate to target any Israeli vessel in the Red Sea or any place we can reach”. Israel has denied any link with the vessel although ownership details in public shipping databases suggest it is owned by one of Israel’s richest men. Most of the Red Sea is wider than 200km (124 miles), but its southern end, the Bab al-Mandeb passage, is a chokepoint less than 20km (12 miles) wide from the Yemeni island of Mayyun across to the coast of Djibouti and Eritrea. Every year, more than 17,000 ships pass through it. That’s nearly 50 a day. Many of them have a legal status like the Galaxy Leader, which flies the flag of the Bahamas, isoperated by a Japanese company, and had a Bulgarian master and a crew from at least five other countries, none of them Israel. In the complex world of shipping, the ownership of a ship is less important than the flag of the vessel, which signifies its country of registration, and its operating company. The Bahamas offers what is known as a “flag of convenience”. It’s a country with low taxes and less stringent labour policies, which attract operators to register their ships there. The operating company is Japan’s Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, known as the NYK Line, which runs 818 ships. Among almost 1,500 ships transiting the straits every month, there may be scores that could be linked to Israel and that are thus vulnerable to further Houthi hijackings. Shipping must go on come what may, so will all “Israel-linked” ships just be left at the mercy of the Houthis? Probably not, but the options to prevent further hijackings are limited to three: sending armed ships to accompany commercial traffic, destroying or severely limiting the Houthi offensive capacity at sea, and persuading them to refrain from attacking. For the first option, the question is who could provide armed naval patrols in the Red Sea? Saudi Arabia and Egypt, countries bordering the Red Sea, have strong and sophisticated navies. But Saudi Arabia is in anuneasy truce with the Houthis, which they are loathe to disturb. Egypt is trying to remain neutral and would not want to get dragged into tensions with the Houthis either. Israel cannot spare any ships for the task. The only force left to deal with the Houthi threat would be the United States navy. Since October 7, the US has deployed many assets to the Middle East, centred around two carrier strike groups (CSGs).The one in the Mediterranean, the CSG 12, is led by the newest and most modern nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford. The CSG 2, currently in the Gulf of Oman, is fronted by the USS Dwight D Eisenhower. Each aircraft carrier is accompanied by a guided missile cruiser, two or three destroyers and a flotilla of auxiliaries, such as tankers, store ships and mobile repair bases. Each of the two CSGs has a clearly defined task: The CSG 12 is to monitor the wider area of Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq and act against any threats that could escalate the conflict. The CSG 2 is there to watch Iran and act against it if the situation escalates. The Eisenhower CSG is being kept outside the Strait of Hormuz as a direct message to Iran that the US has no hostile intentions, yet. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made it clear that his country would continue to support Hamas and the Palestinian people but it does not want to go to war itself. Thus, the CSG 2 is demonstrating a less-than-warlike intention, staying in the Gulf of Oman, from which its aircraft could still reach targets inside Iran if the need arises or it could move into the Gulf in the unlikely case that the US should want to escalate its threat. Outside of the CSGs, the US navy also has individual ships monitoring Houthi missile launches. On October 19, the USS Carney shot down several Houthi missiles and drones targeting Israel. With all these assets having specific tasks, American options are limited. The only ships that can be used to escort commercial shipping are those grouped around the amphibious carrier USS Bataan, currently just south of Suez. Moving it south would weaken US potential to respond to any escalation around Gaza. Which brings us to the second option. The Houthis are known for their readiness to take on even stronger enemies. The US targeting them directly could risk a major escalation. Washington could ask Israel to target Houthi ports with long-range missiles, but even that is risky. So we come to the third option, de-escalation. It seems that again Iran is the key. If the taking of the Galaxy Leader was an independent Houthi actionnot instigated by Tehran, the US could engage in quiet diplomacy to nudge Iran into reigning in its proxy and avoiding new hijackings at sea. This might be the most realistic way out but only if all parties involved show restraint. The stakes are high. Another hijacking could have a snowball effect, pulling in other countries more actively into an already devastating conflict and pushing it to the point of no return.",
What Is­rael’s video of ‘Hamas tun­nel’ un­der al-Shi­fa tells us,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/what-israels-video-of-hamas-tunnel-under-al-shifa-tells-us,"The structure of the tunnel raises questions about whether it is indeed a Hamas-built pathway. The Israeli military released astatementon Sunday saying it had found a Hamas tunnel shaft under Gaza’sal-Shifa Hospital. It also released footage of tunnels taken on November 17. Here is what the footage tells us: On November 15, Israel launched an aggressiveraidon Gaza’s largest medical complex, al-Shifa Hospital. Lasting for days, the raid was described by Israel as a “precise and targeted” operation to find an alleged underground tunnel system that led to a Hamas military control centre. The allegation that Hamas was operating a control centre under the hospital was backed by Israeli andUnited States intelligence. Hamas and medical staff at al-Shifa have denied this allegation. The Israeli military also released a 3D animatedvideoon October 28, visualising an extensive network of tunnels that led to an elaborate, multi-storey control centre. On Sunday, Israelannouncedthat a 55-metre-long (180ft), 10-metre-deep (32ft) tunnel was found under the hospital. The statement said that the tunnel was found “in the area of the hospital underneath a shed alongside a vehicle containing numerous weapons including RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades], explosives, and Kalashnikov rifles”. The Israeli military also released a video that was recorded using two separate cameras on November 17. Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters the entrance was uncovered when a military bulldozer knocked down the outside wall of the hospital, revealing a metallic spiral staircase that descended 10m (32ft) and led to a blast door, which is typically a metallic door with strong closures and hinges, designed to resist explosions. Such doors are usually found on facilities such as bomb shelters. But military analyst Zoran Kusovac quoted a civil engineer from Gaza who suggested that the video is actually clips of two different tunnels spliced together. The first section of the video shows the vertical shaft that goes down. It shows features such as load-bearing concrete columns. They seem to be built with regular civil engineering techniques, which would have required large and loud machines such as concrete mixers. Such a construction could not have been done in secret, the way Hamas tunnels are usually built. The purpose of this construction remains unknown. The second part of the clip shows the horizontal tunnel. This displays features characteristic of Hamas tunnels — pre-fabricated pieces connected together section by section. A control centre has not been found so far. Israeli troops have not yet tried to open the blast door at the end of the tunnel that they claim was under al-Shifa, fearing it could be booby-trapped, said Hagari. Kusovac said that many different types of traps can be placed to prevent tunnel interceptions. Typically, they are improvised explosive devices (IEDs) connected with detonators that can be triggered by tripwire or even light or pressure. They detect the presence of a person entering the tunnel, setting off the explosive. “IEDs are basically like toys the big boys make. The more creative you are, the more successful you are,” said Kusovac. If armies suspect the presence of such traps, typical regulations are to call explosion experts who arrive and assess the situation. Kusovac said that this usually takes a few hours, not over a day. This time delay brings the veracity of the Israeli military’s claims into question. “You say smoking gun, you get to it and then you don’t show the smoking gun,” he said. CNN, among other news outlets, visited the exposed tunnel shaft and confirmed the presence of a tunnel, but could not establish whether or not the tunnel led to a command centre. Tunnels in Gaza werefirst builtin 1980 at a time when the enclave was under Israeli occupation, and before the formation of Hamas in1987. They were constructed under the Egyptian border for smuggling all sorts of goods, including weapons, fuel and black market goods. Over time, Palestinians realised that tunnels could have a military use. Thefirst signof the military use of tunnels was in 2001 when an Israeli military post was blown up with an explosive from underground. The tunnels entered Israeli public consciousness when Palestinian fighters emerged from a tunnel shaft and kidnapped Israeli soldierGilad Shalitin 2006. Israel placed a blockade on the Gaza Strip after Hamas gained control of it in 2007. Tunnels became the means to bypass the siege and to transport food, goods and weapons. Under Hamas, the tunnels expanded strategically. The tunnels are also used by Hamas for wired communications, since Israel can intercept wireless communications. After attacking Gaza in 2014, Israel realised the extent and sophistication of the tunnels, then believed to have surpassed 100km (62 miles). Atunnel warwould entail a whole lot of destruction. The magnitude of explosives would belargerand deadlier than usual due to the smaller area of the tunnels. For the same reason, the use of regular ammunition might be too “clumsy” and hence unviable. Al-Shifa is not the only hospital that Israel has alleged is used by Hamas as a military base. On November 8, Al Jazeera’s verification unit SanaddisprovedIsrael’s claim that there was a Hamas tunnel under the Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Hospital for Rehabilitation and Prosthetics, commonly known as the Qatari Hospital. Satellite images and archival photos showed that the hatch that Israel claimed was the tunnel entrance was actually part of a water reservoir system that was used to fill therapeutic pools for amputees, water the grounds, and also was an emergency water source.

Is­rael tar­gets Gaza’s In­done­sian Hos­pi­tal: Here is what’s to know,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/israel-targets-gazas-indonesian-hospital-here-is-whats-to-know,"There are about 700 people including medical staff and injured people inside Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital. There was intense fighting reported around Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital on Monday. Israelitanks surroundedthe hospital in northern Gaza after artillery fire killed at least 12 Palestinians in the complex. Here is what’s to know: A shell struck the second floor of the Indonesian Hospital, killing at least 12 people, according to a medical worker inside the facility and the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Ashraf al-Qudra, Gaza’s Health Ministry spokesperson, told Al Jazeera that “the situation is catastrophic.” “The Indonesian Hospital staff are insisting they will stay to treat the wounded. There are about 700 people, including medical staff and injured people, inside the hospital,” he said. Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry said it had lost contact with three Indonesian volunteers at the hospital who are part of the group that set up the facility in 2016 with the country’s funding. Marwan Abdallah, a medical worker at the Indonesian Hospital, said that Israeli tanks were operating less than 200 metres (656 feet) from the hospital, and that Israeli snipers could be seen on the roofs of nearby buildings. Another medical worker told Al Jazeera that the shelling is intense and indiscriminate on the hospital building, at the entrance and at the windows. According to the medic, everyone in the hospital has gathered at the centre of the main building. Located in Beit Lahiya, a city of about 90,000 people in north Gaza, the hospital sits on some 16,000 square metres (172,200 square feet) of land donated by the government of Gaza in 2011. Thehospitalhas been sheltering hundreds of displaced people who sought asylum there. It’s also close to the Jabalia refugee camp. The area around the hospital has been struck multiple times by Israeli forces, with at least two civilians killed in those strikes between October 7 and October 28, according to Human Rights Watch. The hospital cost almost $8m to build. It was funded by donations from Indonesian citizens in conjunction with groups including the Indonesian Red Cross Society and the Muhammadiyah Society, one of Indonesia’s largest Muslim organisations. Israel has long accused Hamas of using hospitals and other civilian sites to establish command posts and hide weapons. The army has previously said that it believes the Indonesian Hospital was built on a Hamas tunnel system, in allegations that mirror those that Israel has made against al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Al-Shifa, the Gaza Strip’s main hospital,has been in the spotlight for weeksafter coming under Israeli bombardment. Six weeks into its war on Gaza,Israel’s attackson hospitals have emerged almost as a motif of the conflict. At least 21 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals – including the Strip’s solo cancer centre – are completely out of service, and others have been damaged and are short of medicines and essential supplies. Commentator Taghreed El-Khodary said that Israel “convinced” the world that al-Shifa Hospital was the headquarters of Hamas because it was the easiest route for them to invade Gaza. “They know it is the safest part to go and impose a kind of military headquarters for them in Gaza City. They couldn’t come from the east. Now this is what they’re doing, going to the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya to also impose another headquarters for them to attack and kill more civilians,” El-Khodarytold Al Jazeera. According to Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Doha-based Middle East Council on Global Affairs, this is aform of psychological warfare. “Attacking hospitals tells the population that nowhere for [Palestinians] is safe,” Rahman told Al Jazeera, adding that Israel acts with “total impunity”. Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the act of making Palestinians feel unsafe in every facility in the Gaza Strip is to quell any form of resistance. “This is part of a long-standing pattern of harassment of medical staff and services, in which Israel demonstrates to Palestinians that no one and no space is safe,” Mustafa told Al Jazeera.",
Fam­i­lies of Gaza cap­tives re­ject talk of death penal­ty for Hamas de­tainees,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/families-of-gaza-captives-reject-talk-of-death-penalty-for-hamas-detainees,"Capital punishment bill advanced by the party of Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Relativesof some of the captives taken by Hamas in theOctober 7 attackhave urged far-right Israeli lawmakers not to pursue a bill that would make it easier to use capital punishment against Palestinian detainees. A number of suspected attackers were detained after members of the Palestinian armed group from Gaza killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and kidnapped about 240, Israel said. The proposal was advanced by the party of far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who posted on X on Monday: “The death penalty law for terrorists is no longer a matter of left and right. … [It’s] a moral and essential law for the State of Israel.” Relatives of some of the people held by Hamas told a parliamentary panel that even discussing the death penalty could have catastrophic consequences for their loved ones held in Gaza. “It would mean playing along with their mind games, and in return, we would get pictures of our loves ones murdered, ended, with the state of Israel and not them [Hamas] being blamed for it,” Yarden Gonen, whose sister Romi isamong the hostages, told Ben-Gvir and his party colleagues. “Don’t pursue this until after they are back here,” she said. “Don’t put my sister’s blood on your hands.” The families of the hostages worry that even discussions of executions pose a danger to their relatives who have themselves already been threatened with execution at the hands of Hamas. Gil Dilkma, a cousin to one of the captives, pleaded with Ben-Gvir to drop the legislation. “Remove the law if you have a heart,” he said. Striking a similar note, the Missing Families Forum said in a statement that such discussion “endangers the lives of our loved ones without promoting any public purpose”. Another family member of one of the captives echoed this concern,shouting, “Stop talking about killing Arabs. Start talking about saving Jews!” Some right-wing politicians responded to these objections with consternation. Almog Cohen, a member of the Israeli far-right Otzma Yehudit party shouted back, “You have no monopoly over pain.” “You are silencing other families,” another far-right politician said. Some Israeli politicians have argued in the past that more executions would serve to deter “terrorism”. When a task force was established by Israel’s Ministry of Justice this month to find punishments “befitting the severity of the horrors committed” for those tried and convicted, the death penalty was refloated as an option. Ben-Gvir called for capital punishment to be implemented, saying that doing this was “more critical now than ever … for the sake of those murdered and who fell in the line of duty and, no less, so that there will be no more people kidnapped”. The conservative Likud party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has shown little interest in advancing the bill during its long rule. The only court-ordered death sentence in Israel took place in 1962 when convicted Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann was executed by hanging. Israeli military courts, which often handle cases involving Palestinians, have the power to hand down the death penalty by a unanimous decision of three judges, but this has never been implemented. Linor Dan-Calderon, three of whose relatives are being held captive, accused Ben-Gvir’s party of having “confused priorities”. “You’ve gotten mixed up because we are a nation that pursues life not one that pursues revenge – even if in the past we did something to Eichmann,” she said. “I am simply asking you to drop this from the agenda.”",
"In Brazil’s fave­las, ac­tivists find com­mon ground with Pales­tini­ans in Gaza",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/in-brazils-favelas-activists-find-common-ground-with-palestinians-in-gaza,"Residents of Brazil’s poorest neighbourhoods say they see their struggles reflected in Israel’s treatment of Gaza. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil –Cosme Felippsen’s nephew was 17 years old when he was killed by Brazil’s military police in a Rio de Janeiro alley nicknamed theGaza Strip. “Almost every favela in Rio has an area residents call Gaza,” Felippsen said, pointing to the bullet holes along the alley walls. Residents have used the name for at least 15 years, he added. “It designates the area where most of the gunfire is concentrated at any given time.” The neighbourhood where Felippsen’s nephew, José Vieira, died in 2017 is called Morro da Providência. It is one of hundreds of impoverished communities — orfavelas— strewn across the city. Activists and residents saythe violencethey have seen in the favelas has given them unique insight into the urban warfare currently unfolding in Gaza, a Palestinian territory underIsraeli siege. And the parallels they perceive are motivating them to take action. “Militarisation, armed groups executing inhabitants — many things that happen in Palestine also happen in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro,” said Felippsen, a local politician and tour guide who specialises in Black history. Leftist groups, some of whom have ties to Brazil’s favelas, have organised protests across the country since the Israel-Hamas war began onOctober 7. In the weeks since, more than 13,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed amid an Israelibombingcampaign and ablockadethat cut off essential supplies to the densely populated territory. About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attacks that started the war. UN experts have warnedthat the Palestinian people are at “grave risk of genocide”. Adriana Odara Martins, who lives in the Baixada Fluminense neighbourhood on the outskirts of Rio, was among the protesters calling for a ceasefire in front of the local United States consulate in October. Her community, she explained, was frequently the target ofpolice operations, and she found her experiences reflected in recent media coverage of Gaza. “We are here in solidarity because we have empathy. We know what it is like to live under violence,” said Martins, who is part of the feminist group Articulation of Brazilian Women and a coordinator for the Unified Black Movement. Police in Brazilkilled more than 6,400 people last year, 83 percent of them Black, according to the nonprofit Brazilian Public Security Forum. The violence is particularly acute in the favelas,tightly packed urban environmentswhere a majority of residents are Black or mixed race. Palestinians and residents of favelas are commonly perceived as “racially subaltern populations”, said Bruno Huberman, a professor of international relations at the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo. They share a history of systematic repression, expulsion from their homes, confinement in segregated spaces, subjugation and exploitation, he told Al Jazeera. “Both populations are subjected to infinite wars: the Palestinians to the war on terror and the favela populations to the war on drugs,” Huberman said. While hesitant to compare the violence afflicting the two groups, Fatima Ouassak, a French political scientist, author and activist, said she too had noticed similarities in how favela residents and Palestinians were treated in their respective homelands. “These populations are made to feel illegitimate where they live, as if they were not at home or welcome where they are,” she told Al Jazeera. This feeling, Ouassak added, extended to other Arab and African diaspora communities in places like France. The perceived similarities have led some social movements in the favelas to identify explicitly with the Palestinian struggle. Every year since 2016, activists in Rio organise “Black July”, an event that brings together populations facing racism and militarisation for activities and discussions. The issue of Palestinian rights often features in these events. This year’s Black July included a webinar from two Brazilian activists — Gizele Martins and Thais Siqueira — who had recently returned from a trip to the occupiedWest Bank. “I thought we were the only ones suffering in the favelas,” Martins said during the webinar. A resident of Rio’s Maré favela, she first visited the West Bank in 2017. “As soon as I got there, I saw that everything was very similar — but much more tense.” One of the similarities she pointed out was thesecurity wallIsrael constructed through Palestinian communities in the West Bank. In August, Rio de Janeiro state Governor Claudio Castro announced the construction of a wall bordering certain favelas, also in the name of security. “Wall of shame! Rio’s apartheid wall,” Martins said on Instagram after the announcement, evoking the West Bank barrier. But the identification between the two groups has its limits. Mike, a pro-Palestinian protester who declined to give his surname, said there was more talk in support of Israel than Palestine in the favela where he resides, Barreira do Vasco. “I sometimes feel a bit alone in backing Palestine,” Mike told Al Jazeera at the demonstration in front of the US consulate in Rio de Janeiro. In recent years, favelas have seen a rise inevangelical Christianity, a religious movement that identifies strongly with Israel. Though Brazil has the largest Catholic population in the world,evangelicalismis believed to be its fastest-growing religious group. Roughly 30 percent of the population identifies as evangelical. Favelas in particular are seen as hotbeds for the church’s growth, as religious leaders reach out to impoverished residents with social services like job opportunities and education. Guilherme Casarões, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university, explained that evangelicals are more likely to sympathise with Israel due to their view that the country is a holy place to be protected. “The idea is that Jesus Christ will only return to Earth to save humanity when the people of Jerusalem have converted to his word,” Casarões said. That view, Casarões added, has translated into “unconditional alignment with Israel” politically. “Even if there is some criticism of the killing of innocent Palestinians in Gaza, the predominant view is that Israel has the right to defend itself in this battle between good and evil,” he said. That viewpoint clashes with the stance of current left-wing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Over the past month, Lula has been sharply critical of Israel’s relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip, denouncing the Palestinian bloodshed. “This is not a war. This is a genocide,” Lula told journalists at the Planalto presidential palace in Brasilia on October 25. He also used a social media address on Tuesday to call Israel’s actions “equivalent to terrorism”. In his previous two terms in office, from 2003 to 2010, Lula was likewise outspoken in his defence of Palestinian rights. Latin America’s biggest democracy has for decades called for a two-state solution to the conflict, one that would allow the creation of a separate Palestinian state alongside Israel. In 2010, Lula took a step towards that goal, recognising Palestine as an independent state based on 1967 borders. The Israeli government responded with a statement expressing its “sadness and disappointment” about the decision. Experts say Lula’s rhetoric echoes that of otherleft-leaning Latin American leaders. Bolivia cutofficial tieswith Israel over the war in Gaza, while Chile and Colombia have recalled their ambassadors in Tel Aviv for consultations. By contrast, right-wing Latin American leaders have sympathized more openly with Israel, according to Casarões. They also tend to enjoy more evangelical support. Former far-right PresidentJair Bolsonarostopped short of changing Brazil’s longstanding support of the two-state solution, though he did make public statements denying Palestine was a country. When Bolsonaro and Lula went head to head in the 2022 presidential race, the favela vote became key, given how narrow the margins between the two leaders were. Residents in the favelas constitute a major voting bloc. An estimated 16 million people live in poorly resourced urban areas like favelas, and in Rio de Janeiro alone, at least a quarter of the population lives in areas considered favelas. Lula ultimatelyedged outBolsonaro in the final vote. In the weeks before the election, the nonprofit G10 Favelas/Favela Diz found that Lula held a seven-point lead over Bolsonaro among favela voters, with 38 percent support to the far-right leader’s 31 percent. Whether Lula’s foreign policy stance will affect that support remains to be seen. But Huberman, the international relations professor, said Brazil’s economy and quality of life are the biggest factors to sway the vote. However, some Palestinian rights supporters would like to see Lula do more to address the ongoing conflict. Fransergio Goulart, a coordinator for the Right to Memory and Racial Justice Initiative in Rio de Janeiro, said he observed Lula’s popularity decreasing among his fellow activists. They felt the left-wing president was not taking a strong enough stance against Israel’s military offensive. “Lula should position himself against Israel, and he hasn’t done that,” Goulart said. Part of the issue is Brazil’s ongoing ties to Israel’sdefence industry. Brazil has long purchased weaponry and armoured vehicles from Israel to bolster its own security capabilities. In 2013, for instance, the state of Rio de Janeiro signed an agreement with the Israeli company Global Shield to buy armoured vehicles for its military police, local newspaper Estadão reported at the time. And in October, Sao Paulo’s military police showcased 7.62mm calibre Light Negev machine guns bought from Israel Weapon Industries Ltd in 2020, the local news organization Ponte reported. This kind of weaponry has been used in the favelas in the name of combating gang violence. “For years, military technologiestestedon Palestinians have been used in Brazil,” Goulart wrote in an article in March, referencing efforts to crack down on gangs in the favelas ahead of major sporting events. Huberman noted that tiesbetween Israel and Brazilhave actually deepened when Lula’s Workers’ Party was in power, particularly in the area of security cooperation. Last month, for instance, Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies — with the backing of the Workers’ Party — voted to renew three cooperation agreements with Israel, including one to combat organised crime. This creates a contradiction, Huberman said, between Lula’s stance on Israel’s military offensives and his embrace of Israel as a domestic security partner. “Palestinians have asked for an end to military relations [between Brazil and Israel],” Huberman said, “because there is no point in Brazil asking for peace but buying Israeli weapons that sustain the occupation.”",

‘No end in sight’: Gaza’s trau­ma­tised chil­dren need psy­cho­log­i­cal aid,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/no-end-in-sight-gazas-traumatised-children-need-psychological-aid,"Doctors at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital say children are showing signs of trauma and distress after seeing parents, relatives killed. Deir el-Balah, central Gaza Strip –Within the busy courtyard of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza Strip, psychologist Mohamed Abushawish has carved a space to provide early psychological assistance to children seeking refuge there. Beneath Israel’s relentless bombardment of Gaza, Abushawish provides activities for the children in the hospital’s hallways and open spaces. Since thefirst days of the war, about 300 families have sought shelter in the hospital. Numbers have steadily increased following orders from the Israeli authorities for residents of Gaza City in the north to relocate to the southern side of the Strip. Timidly, the children tentatively join an active circle organised by Abushawish, who gently invites them to come in. Among them, 10-year-old Hamsa Irshi, with a bright smile, claps along with the other children in the circle. She recounted to Al Jazeera the story of her family’s departure from their home in the al-Daraj neighbourhood of eastern Gaza City. “Last Friday, my mother and three siblings accompanied me to my uncle’s house in Deir el-Balah,” she said. “However, that same night, Israeli air raids targeted my uncle’s house, killing their entire family.” For a brief moment, Hamsa fought back tears, then continued. “We were in a room somewhat distant from the direct strike. My mother sustained minor injuries, and they managed to rescue us from beneath the rubble.” Of the people who were at her uncle’s house that night, only her mother, three brothers and two cousins survived the bombing. Her three uncles and their families were killed. Hamsa’s father and other siblings are still in Gaza City. Despite her shock, Hamsa actively takes part in the mental support activities, talking about her fear of war. She says she is desperate for it to end, stating: “I don’t feel safe”. Meanwhile, 12-year-old Malak Khatab, who normally lives in the Deir el-Balah camp, expressed her delight after taking part in the activities. She said the children yearn for more such activities to help lift their spirits. Malak recounted a horrifying night from a week ago when she, along with her family, were terrified by the bombing of their neighbour’s house. She described how they were abruptly awakened by falling debris, followed by a huge explosion. Malak found herself trapped under rubble, her father frantically trying to keep her safe. Civil defence teams later rescued them. The Khatab family’s home suffered extensive damage from the bombing, as did other nearby homes. Consequently, they were forced to seek refuge at the hospital, where they now sleep on the ground. There are no more beds. Nearby in the hospital yard, 12-year-old Anas al-Mansi is lying on a mattress on the ground, seemingly uninterested in the children’s activities unfolding around him. After initial resistance, Anas eventually agreed to speak to Al Jazeera following a persuasive conversation with his uncle. He explained his lack of interest in the activities, saying: “I don’t have a desire to do anything.” Then, Anas recounted the tragic loss of his father and aunt in an air attack on their home in Deir el-Balah a week ago. He described a night when they were sound asleep and, suddenly, a massive explosion shattered the peace. Anas couldn’t recall the specific details, except for his father’s final words, instructing them to recite “Shahadatain” (declaration of faith). “My father’s voice slowly faded away, and I found myself buried under debris and dust. I called my father, but he didn’t answer,” Anas said. “I knew he might be killed.” As he spoke, Anas bared his back, revealing a multitude of bruises and wounds. The family was trapped beneath the rubble for a period before being rescued. “My brother also suffered severe back injuries, leaving him unable to walk, and my mother is still in the hospital after she got injured in her legs.” Anas said he wishes for a swift end to the war but added he has no desire to return to a semblance of a normal life. “There is no life,” he said firmly. The hospital’s mental health unit has made a special commitment to support these children, Abushawish said. Many of them have relatives who are wounded or deceased, or have been displaced and are now taking shelter in the hospital, all of which have taken a significant toll on their psychological wellbeing, he added. Abushawish said the children are also suffering from distressing psychological and physical symptoms as a result of the trauma. “These symptoms, such as abdominal pain, headaches, foot pain, involuntary urination and rapid heartbeats, were direct consequences of the relentless bombings in the Gaza Strip,” he said. Abushawish added that many children are exhibiting clear signs of post-traumatic stress after losing their parents and being rescued from rubble after days stuck beneath it. “These were harrowing and overwhelming events that exceeded what children, the most vulnerable members of society, should endure,” he said. “The therapeutic activities serve as crucial initial psychological aid and swift intervention to alleviate the traumatic effects on the children, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict. “There is no immediate horizon for a near end to the war. Therefore these activities help them withstand, endure and adapt to what is happening around them,” Abushawish concluded.",
Russ­ian diplo­ma­cy lever­ages Gaza con­flict for moral high ground,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/russian-diplomacy-leverages-israel-hamas-war-for-moral-high-ground,"The latest Middle East conflict could help Russia escape punishment for aggression and war crimes in Ukraine, say experts. The European Union and the United States have framed their defence of Ukraine as a principled stance against an aggressor and a war criminal, Russia. But Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza is undermining their moral high ground and weakening criminal prosecutions against Russia, international relations and law experts say. “When attacks on public infrastructure happened in Ukraine, it led to a discussion in terms of how they violated the Geneva Convention,” said Christian Bueger, a professor of international relations at the University of Copenhagen. “Now we’re facing a situation where inthe Gaza hospitaland so on, we are clearly beyond the borders ofinternational humanitarian law,” he told Al Jazeera, referring to Israel’s siege and subsequent raid of al-Shifa Hospital, where the lack of electricity, water and medicine has put patients’ lives at risk. “That opens up a discussion of what justified warfare looks like in terms of our contemporary age,” he said, and “shatters what we thought was the set of norms of how military operations should be carried out”. For Ukraine’s Western allies, “the moral high ground is shrouded in fog”, said an editorial by Chatham House, a British think tank. This has political and legal ramifications, complicating the task of holding Russia accountable for its crimes in Ukraine. UN and European investigators have been documenting the suspected torture, rape and summary executions of civilians in Bucha, Izyum and elsewhere in Ukraine. These alleged war crimes and atrocities will be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction Ukraine accepts. In March, the ICC indicted Russian President Vladimir Putin and his commissioner for children’s rights for allegedly ordering the abduction of Ukrainian children, a war crime. The ICC is also documenting alleged war crimes in what the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, on Friday referred to as the State of Palestine. Israel does not recognise Palestine or the ICC’s jurisdiction on what it considers its territory. “The US and UK support the Israeli view. So it would be very difficult for these states now to argue, ‘Yes, the ICC has jurisdiction over Russians who commit crimes in Ukraine, but no, it does not have jurisdiction over Israelis who commit crimes in Palestine,'” said Marko Milanovic, a professor of public international law at Reading University. The US-UK view is clearly opposed by several Muslim-majority nations and some countries in the Global South. Five of them – South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti – asked Khan to investigate and prosecute suspected crimes in Gaza. The Global South’s more ambivalent view of Russia’s actions has further ramifications for Ukraine. For a year, Ukraine has led an international effort to set up aspecial courtthat will try Russia for its war of aggression – a crime under the UN Charter. To create this court, Ukraine needs to win a two-thirds majority in the UN General Assembly. “For that court to have any chance of being remotely legitimate and successful, it needs to get support not just from Western allies of Ukraine but also from the nonaligned/Global South countries,” Milanovic told Al Jazeera. “And now, after Gaza, most of these countries are not going to be willing to play ball… The West has lost whatever moral leverage it had in pushing for this new institution … the more the Gaza [war] goes on and the US supports Israel, the less other states will support this.” Russia has been quick to capitalise on the moral and legal murkiness Israel’s counterattack on Hamas created. Two days after the Hamas October 7 attack on Israel, Russiarefusedto endorse a US-sponsored United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the attack, which killed about 1,200 Israelis. “Their goal is to portray themselves as peacemakers, and they can’t be seen as following the US lead,” said Maxim Alyukov, a researcher at Manchester University’s department of Russian and East European studies, who monitors Russian official language and propaganda. Russia’s narrative, he said, is that “terrorists have to be punished … but you don’t blame the nation for a few individuals, and you don’t bomb Gaza for an Islamist group”. That could be seen as indirect criticism of the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq after al-Qaeda’s attacks on 9/11. Russian President Vladimir Putin pinned some blame on the United States regarding the latest Middle East conflict. “I think that many people will agree with me that this is a vivid example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East,” Putin said in late October. Russia claimed to support “a multilateral approach to the Middle East settlement issue” in a November 7 Foreign Ministry statement that also criticised Israeli settlements in the West Bank. “Nobody criticises Israel, and there are double standards here because when it comes to Ukraine, they openly criticise the fact that civilians are dying, but they don’t seem concerned that Palestinians are dying,” said Alyukov, summarising the Russian position. He called the Gaza war “a gift to the Kremlin”. Russia’s position potentially weakens the rules-based international order Western states say they are trying to uphold, said experts, and many countries agree with Russia’s accusations of double standards within it. On November 18, US President Joe Biden asked, in an op-ed published in The Washington Post: “Will we relentlessly pursue our positive vision for the future, or will we allow those who do not share our values to drag the world to a more dangerous and divided place?” Earlier this year, Russia held a summit with African countries, a part of the Global South it is making particular efforts to cultivate with promises of cheap oil and grain, despite the fact that its war in Ukraine has raised the prices of both. “African nations clearly signalled to Russia: ‘Yes we are interested in cheaper supplies, but we are not willing to play the game of translating that into diplomatic support for Russia,’” said Bueger. “The countries in the Global South know what game Russia is playing there.”",
"Why does Is­rael tar­get Pales­tin­ian hos­pi­tals? Psy­ops, say an­a­lysts",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/20/why-does-israel-target-palestinian-hospitals-psyops-say-analysts,"Targeting hospitals is psychological warfare Israel can get away with with the US’s tacit approval, say analysts. Israeli tanks close in on a Palestinian hospital. Doctors and medical staff are warned that they must leave — with or without patients in need. Artillery assaults follow, even if thousands of people are still inside. On Monday, it was the turn of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, Gaza. At least 12 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on the facility, even as armoured vehicles edge closer and closer to the hospital. But it was only the latest medical centre to face the wrath of the Israeli army. Six weeks into its war on Gaza, Israel’s attacks on hospitals have emerged almost as a motif of the conflict, even thoughrefugee camps,schoolsandchurcheshave not been spared either. At least 21 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals — including the strip’s solo cancer centre — are completely out of service, and others have been damaged and are short of medicines and essential supplies. On Sunday,31 premature babies were evacuatedfrom al-Shifa Hospital to Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip after weeks of being fed formula mixed with contaminated water, without incubators that shut off from a lack of fuel caused by Israel’s near-complete siege on the enclave since the October 7 Hamas attack. At least eight babies had already died. Israeli forces have, in effect, occupied al-Shifa since last week after bombarding parts of the hospital. As with Gaza’s other hospitals, al-Shifa was sheltering thousands of civilians displaced by Israeli bombing, in addition to patients and medics. On Friday, Israel’s military extended its approach in Gaza to the occupied West Bank, where armoured vehiclessurrounded at least four hospitals. The Ibn Sina Hospital, one of the largest in the West Bank, was raided. And in early November, Israeli forces arrested some patients and their attendants from anEast Jerusalem hospital. But why does Israel target Palestinian hospitals given that this also brings significant criticism from leading human rights organisations, which haveaccused it of war crimes?

Officially, Israel insists that it is targeting facilities that house Hamas fighters or infrastructure. Israelclaimed Hamas was using al-Shifa as a command centre, for instance. But Hamas has denied that claim, and days after taking control of the facility, Israel has been unable to provide strong evidence to back its assertions. The real reason Israel targets hospitals is different, according to Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Doha-based Middle East Council on Global Affairs. It is a form of psychological warfare, he said. “Attacking hospitals tells the population that nowhere for [Palestinians] is safe,” Rahman told Al Jazeera, adding that Israel acts with “total impunity”. Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the act of making Palestinians feel unsafe in every facility in the strip is to quell any form of resistance. “This is part of a longstanding pattern of harassment of medical staff and services, in which Israel demonstrates to Palestinians that no one and no space is safe,” Mustafa told Al Jazeera. “It is a systematic attempt to intimidate local populations and undermine their will to resist,” she added. Throughout the war, Israel has targeted a number of ambulances and medical facilities in the West Bank and Gaza, claiming that Palestinian fighters use them to move around and shelter, without providing evidence for these claims, the analyst said.

Israel also targets civilian buildings like hospitals because it can get away with it, said Trita Parsi, the executive vice president at the Washington-headquartered Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. “The only scrutiny and the only imposed limits that matter are the ones that come from the United States,” Parsi told Al Jazeera. “Israel’s calculation is that international outcry doesn’t matter as long as theUnited States refuses to put any limitson Israeli actions,” he added. In the absence of this pressure from the US, combined with the “most extremist” and right-wing government Israel has ever had, “Israelis are taking the opportunity to do things they otherwise could not do”, Parsi explained. Still, as the war wages on, the US may be compelled to urge its ally to dial down the ferocity of its attacks, as its image wears down around the world. “The US’s global standing and credibility is plummeting as a result of its green light for Israeli actions of this kind,” said Parsi. “It’s possible [this may not] continue for much longer, because the damage this is doing to the United States is simply not tolerable.”",
Is­raeli tanks be­siege Gaza’s In­done­sian Hos­pi­tal,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/israeli-tanks-surround-gazas-indonesian-hospital-after-killing-12-people,"The situation in northern Gaza’s sole remaining medical facility is ‘catastrophic’, the Health Ministry says. Israeli tanks have surrounded northern Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital after artillery fire killed at least 12 Palestinians in the complex, according to the war-torn enclave’s Ministry of Health. Ashraf al-Qudra, Gaza’s Health Ministry spokesperson, told Al Jazeera on Monday that “the situation is catastrophic” in the Indonesian Hospital, where hundreds of people remain trapped. “The Indonesian Hospital staff are insisting they will stay to treat the wounded. There are about 700 people, including medical staff and injured people, inside the hospital,” he said. The Israeli military, which rarely publicises troop movements, had no immediate comment. The Palestinian news agency Wafa said the facility in the northeast Gaza town of Beit Lahiya had been hit by artillery fire. Palestinian health officials said there were frantic efforts to evacuate civilians out of harm’s way. Hospital staff denied there were any armed militants on the premises. Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi condemned Israel’s actions and urged Tel Aviv’s partners to “stop its atrocities”. “The attack is a clear violation of international humanitarian laws. All countries, especially those that have close relations with Israel, must use all their influence and capabilities to urge Israel to stop its atrocities,” she said in a statement.

The advance on the facility, set up in 2016 with funding from Indonesian organisations, came a day after the World Health Organization evacuated 31 premature babies from al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. They were among more than 250 critically ill or wounded patients stranded there since Israeli forces entered the compound. The territory’s largest health facility is beingevacuatedat gunpoint after being under siege for several days with 7,000 people inside. The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA has reported the “collapse of services” at hospitals across northern Gaza following widespread air strikes and the lack of fuel and medical supplies. The Israeli military claims Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, has built underground infrastructure below hospitals for military usage, which Hamas and medical officials deny. Marwan Abdallah, a medical worker at the Indonesian Hospital, said Israeli tanks were visible from the windows. “You can see them moving around and firing,” he said. “Women and children are terrified. There are constant sounds of explosions and gunfire.” Abdallah said the hospital had received dozens of dead and wounded in air raids and shelling overnight. Israel launched its offensive against Gaza after a wave of cross-border raids by Hamas on October 7 killed more than 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The Hamas-run government says the death toll from Israel’s aerial bombardment and ground operations in the Palestinian territory has reached 13,000, thousands of them children.",
Japan seek­ing talks with Houthi hi­jack­ers of Red Sea Is­raeli-linked ship,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/japan-in-direct-contact-with-houthi-rebels-on-highjacked-ship,"Japan has approached Yemeni rebels in a bid to secure the release of the Galaxy Leader, hijacked in Red Sea. Japan says it is “directly approaching” the Houthi rebels who havehijacked a cargo ship in the Red Sea. Tokyo said on Monday that it is also “communicating with Israel” as it seeks to secure the release of the Galaxy Leader. The ship is owned by an Israeli businessman and operated by a Japanese firm. The Yemeni rebel group attacked the vessel the previous day while it was to India from Turkey in response, it said, to the “heinous acts” being committed by Israel in Gaza. The Japanese government has “strongly condemned” the seizure of the ship, which is operated by Nippon Yusen (NYK Line). Tokyo hasurgedother concerned countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, to participate in persuading the rebels to release the vessel and hostages soon. Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said Tokyo was “communicating with Israel, and in addition to directly approaching the Houthis, we are also urging Saudi Arabia, Oman, Iran and other countries concerned to strongly urge the Houthis for the early release of the vessel and crew members”. “Our government will continue to take necessary measures in cooperation with the countries concerned while taking into account the situation,” she added. Israel was quick to blame the attack on an “Iranian act of terrorism”, saying it will be echoed with consequences for international maritime security. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani on Monday denied Iran’s involvement in the seizure of the ship, which Israel has claimed is British-owned and Japanese-operated. After the attack, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree posted on X, “If the international community is concerned about regional security and stability, rather than expanding the conflict, it should put an end to Israel’s aggression against Gaza.” The vehicle transport ship was manned at the time of the attack by a 25-person international crew, including Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Filipinos and Mexicans, but no Israelis, according to Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was not involved in the ship’s ownership, operation or the makeup of its international crew, although the parent carrier company belongs to Israeli businessman Abraham “Rami” Ungar, according to records. The Houthis have launched several missile and droneattacks against Israelsince October 7, when an attack by Hamas inside Israel prompted an Israeli ground and air offensive on Gaza. Last week, the Iran-aligned Houthis said they could target Israeli ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. Saree renewed the warning that any ship belonging to Israel or those who support it will be a legitimate target for Houthi forces.",
Bet­ter than a tent: The Gaza fam­i­ly liv­ing in ru­ins of their bombed home,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/20/better-than-a-tent-the-family-living-in-ruins-of-their-home-in-gaza,"The Naji family decided to stay in their home, which was destroyed in an Israeli air attack, rather than being displaced Deir al-Balah –On the third day of Israel’s offensive on the Gaza Strip, Siham Naji was sitting opposite her husband Khaled in their living room when she remembered to take her daily medication. She walked to the kitchen and opened the door to the refrigerator to get some water. The next second she found herself in hell. “I was knocked to the floor and felt something hot over me,” the 48-year-old said. The air around her had darkened and filled with dust, the sounds of destruction ringing in her ears. An Israeli missile hit her neighbour’s house, flattening it completely and damaging the Naji home. Siham screamed out her husband’s name repeatedly before she heard his faint laboured breathing. Crawling on her hands and knees, she made it back to the living room and saw the lower half of Khaled’s body buried under the rubble. Blood trickled out of his mouth. Her son Mustafa lay in shock in his bedroom, thinking he had lost all feeling in his body. Eventually, mother and son managed to free Khaled from the rubble and the three staggered out of their ruined home, hurt but alive. The Naji family home, where 15 members were staying, had been a labour of love – Khaled built it himself over the years. It boasted two living rooms, three bedrooms, a kitchen, a large bathroom and a partially-finished apartment for his married son on the second floor. “It was like living in my own palace,” Khaled, 51, said. “All my life and dreams were in this house.” “I was in the process of building a balcony overlooking the garden,” he added. “I had plans to make a small swimming pool for the younger children in the summer.” A day after the attack, Khaled returned to survey the damage to his beloved house. “All those years of working were poured into the effort of building this house with my own hands, with the help of my wife,” he said. “I mixed the concrete and designed the layout and picked the best furniture.” The family had received word that a house in their neighbourhood would be targeted but did not know which one. For about 10 days, the family tried sheltering at a school but found the conditions unbearable. “There’s no water, electricity, or privacy,” Siham said. “It’s very crowded. So we went toAl-Aqsa Martyrs Hospitalbut the situation there was more or less the same.” The Naji family decided to return to their home and live among the ruins, seeing it as a better option. After removing rubble from one room and cleaning it as best as they could, they laid mattresses down for sleeping. The room had no doors or windows. “Where else would we go, on the streets under a tarp?” Khaled asked rhetorically. “So that if my children don’t die in anIsraeli attack, they’ll die from freezing to death or from any of thediseasesthat have broken out? I’d rather die in my home with dignity than live in a tent.” According to the Ministry of Public Works and Housing in Gaza, Israeli bombing has damagedmore than halfof all residential units – more than 222,000 homes – in the Gaza Strip. At least 40,000 homes have been completely destroyed but the ministry has not been able to update these statistics since November 6 when it collapsed. The now-ruined Naji home is littered with debris. Metal pipes poke out of broken concrete and there are gaping holes where walls once stood. The kitchen has remained mostly intact. Through a small corridor, past the damaged washing machine, is the room where the family sleeps. Layan Naji, 15, hangs up the hand-washed laundry on ropes tied over the ruins. “The room we sleep in gets very cold,” she said. But she is grateful her seven-year-old cat, Sondos, survived the Israeli air raid. “I thought I lost Sondos and was so happy when my father found her,” she said. “She always sleeps by my feet.” Because all of their bedding was lost, her mother had to borrow a blanket and pillow from a neighbour. “My daughters hang out in the room but I find myself needing space so I sit alone, with my hand on my cheek,” Siham said. She thinks mostly of their ruined garden, which had guava, fig, lemon and date palm trees. “I loved our garden,” she said. “We would sit there and enjoy drinking tea, and talk. I hope we will be able to rebuild our house and make it even better than before.”",

Chi­na-Mid­dle East sum­mit told ‘Is­rael seeks to end Pales­tini­ans’ pres­ence’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/israel-seeks-to-end-palestinians-presence-on-their-land-pa-minister,"Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki’s comments come at a Beijing meeting seeking solutions to end the war. Israel seeks to end the Palestinian people’s presence on their “historical land,” Palestine’s foreign minister has said. Riyad al-Maliki’s comments came as diplomats from Arab and Muslim-majority nations met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Monday. Beijing is hosting a delegation of foreign ministers from the Palestinian Authority, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan for talks aimed at finding a solution to end the war in the Gaza Strip. The summit, during which China pledged to work to “restore peace in the Middle East,” is seen as part of a push by Beijing to step up its international role. The Palestinian Authority’s al-Maliki accused Israel of seeking to “bring to an end the Palestinian people’s presence on what remains of its historical land,” AFP reports. A spokesperson for Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip will threaten peace, security and stability in the region and the world. “Egypt is making every effort to bring aid into the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, but Israel’s policy of obstructing the entry of aid is a systematic policy aimed at pushing the Palestinians to leave the strip under the weight of bombing and siege,” the spokesperson said. China, the host of the summit, has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinians. Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the visiting diplomats that his country could see that “a humanitarian disaster is unfolding in Gaza” and that it must be stopped. “The situation in Gaza affects all countries around the world, questioning the human sense of right and wrong and humanity’s bottom line,” he said, before urging the international community to “act urgently” to prevent the war from spreading. Following the outbreak of the war last month, Wang reportedly told his Saudi counterpart Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud in a phone call that “Israel’s actions have gone beyond self-defence”. Wang and other Chinese officials called for an immediate ceasefire and a “cooling down” of the situation. Beijing has repeatedly called for a two-state solution to end the war, which has now killed more than 13,000 Palestinian people in Gaza and some 1,200 in Israel. Beijing’s Middle East envoy Zhai Jun visited the region last month seeking a solution to end the war and has been in talks with Russia to work together to help Israel and Palestine reach a two-state solution. At the summit, Wang highlighted again that Beijing is “a good friend and brother of Arab and Muslim countries”.  “China firmly stands with justice and fairness in this conflict,” he said. “We are willing to work together with our brothers and sisters in Arab and Islamic countries to make unremitting efforts to settle the war in Gaza as soon as possible,” he added. The meetings are a sign that China is stepping up its international role by filling a power vacuum left by the US, according to political analyst Ibrahim Fraihat. “The US has shot itself in the foot by throwing all of its weight behind Israel’s side and by doing so, it has diminished its role as a credible third party intervener,” Fraihat, of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera. “They [Chinese authorities] are very interested in this role – they have strong ties with Israel, they have the trust of the Palestinians and weight in the international system,” he added, referring to China’s veto power at the UN Security Council.",
Macron tells Ne­tanyahu ‘too many civil­ian loss­es’ in Gaza bom­bard­ment,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/macron-tells-netanyahu-too-many-civilian-losses-in-gaza-bombardment,"French president spoke to Israeli prime minister as Paris prepared more humanitarian aid for Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu there were “too many civilian losses” in Israel’s war in Gaza, as Paris readied more humanitarian aid for the besieged enclave. Israel has said it wants to destroy the Palestinian armed group after it killed about 1,200 people and took hundreds morecaptivein a surprise assault on October 7. More than 13,000 people in Gaza, some 70 percent of them women and children according to the United Nations, have beenkilledin the air and land offensive.Hospitals, schools and refugee settlements have also come under sustained attack. According to a statement from Macron’s office on Sunday, the French president reminded Netanyahu of the “absolute necessity to distinguish terrorists from the population” and “the importance of achieving an immediate humanitarian truce leading to a ceasefire”. Macron also condemned violence against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, the statement said. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed there since Israel began its war in Gaza. The French leader told Netanyahu about his “great concern over the escalation in violence against Palestinian civilians” in the occupied West Bank and called for calm. Macron also spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who is from the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank. He told Abbas of “the need for the Palestinian Authority and all countries in the region to unequivocally and with the greatest firmness condemn the terrorist attack carried out by Hamas in Israel on October 7”. Earlier on Sunday, Macron announced new humanitarian assistance for Gaza where there are growing fears of starvation. The president said France would send an aircraft with more than 10 tonnes of medical supplies at the start of the week, and will contribute to European Union medical aid flights on November 23 and 30. It is also preparing a second hospital ship, the helicopter carrier Dixmude, which will arrive in Egypt in the coming days. The French helicopter carrier – the Tonnerre, which has about 60 beds and two operating theatres – has already been deployed to the region. The statement added that “France is mobilising all its available means to contribute to the evacuation of wounded and sick children requiring emergency care from the Gaza Strip to its hospitals”. Macron said later on X, formerly Twitter, that up to 50 children could be flown for treatment in hospitals in France “if useful and necessary”. Earlier this month, French planes delivered 54 tonnes of aid for Gaza via Egypt.",
Qatar PM says only ‘mi­nor’ chal­lenges to Is­rael-Hamas cap­tive deal,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/qatar-pm-says-only-minor-challenges-to-israel-hamas-captive-deal,"More than 200 people are thought to have been taken to Gaza after Hamas’s assault on Israel on October 7. Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has said that only “minor” challenges remain to a deal to release some of the more than 200 peopletaken captive into Gazaafter Hamas’s attack on Israel last month. Sheikh Mohammed, a former foreign minister, gave few additional details or a timeline. “The challenges that remain in the negotiations are very minor compared to the bigger challenges. They are more logistical; they are more practical,” he told a joint press conference with the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. Qatar has been acting as anintermediary in negotiationsto free those taken captive in Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel on October 7, in which at least 1,200 people were killed. After the attack, Israel launched arelentless air and ground campaignon the besieged Gaza Strip, bombarding the densely-populated territory in an effort to destroy Hamas. More than 13,000 people have been killed in the weeks since. Borrell, who was due to meet Qatar’s emir before travelling to Jordan, called for the “unconditional release” of all captives and condemned Hamas for the attack. “There’s no hierarchy between horrors, one horror doesn’t justify another horror,” he said, urging an end to the escalating violence and the creation of “sustainable peace” in the region. The Reuters news agency reported on November 15 that Qatari mediators had been seeking a deal between Israel and Hamas to exchange 50 captives in return for a three-day ceasefire that would help boost emergency aid shipments to Gaza civilians, citing an official briefed on the talks. At the time, the official said general outlines had been agreed, but that Israel was still negotiating details. On Saturday, the Washington Post newspaper reported a tentative agreement had been reached to free the women and children among the captives in exchange for a pause in fighting. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said all parties would halt combat operations for at least five days with the captives to be released in small groups. The US newspaper’s report was denied by the White House, which said discussions on a deal were continuing. On Sunday, United States President Joe Biden told reporters he was not in a position to say when the captives might be freed. “I want to make sure they’re out and then I’ll tell you,” he said at an event in Virginia. Sheikh Mohammed said on Sunday that such reports were “counterproductive” and that the negotiating process went through ups and downs. “I think that I’m now more confident that we are close enough to reach a deal that can bring the people safely back to their homes,” he said. The talks are continuing as Israel prepares to expand its ground offensive against Hamas into Gaza’s southern half. The US, Israel’s main ally, has urged caution, as Gaza’s 2.3 million people struggle to find anywhere safe to stay out of the line of fire. The civilian death toll in Gaza was “staggering and unacceptable,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday as he renewed his appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. Israel has so far refused all calls for a ceasefire.",

This self-defense strike resulted in several enemy KIA [killed in action]”. Further details on the casualties were not immediately available, and officials did not give the exact location of the strike. US officials say bases housing US personnel in Syria and Iraq have been targeted dozens of times since the Israel-Hamas war began, raising the possibility of wider escalation in the fighting.

Literally the entire northern part of Gaza City right now is under heavy bombardment and air strikes. Confrontations with the Israeli military are also taking place right at the centre of Gaza at the axis where the Israeli military pushed their armoured vehicles. Where we are reporting from, in Khan Younis, has also been a major target of Israeli air strikes. We are talking about both sides – the eastern side of Khan Younis and the western side of the city. People from the eastern side who were told to move to the western side have found themselves the target of Israeli air strikes. We are talking about more residential homes and an apartment [which] was also targeted in one of the residential towers. Palestinians living in tents and other makeshift shelters are bracing for a cold and wet winter, with theWHO warningrain could also further spread disease. More than 1.7 million people – more than 70 percent of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million – are estimated to have now been forced to leave their homes, according to the UN’s latestflash update.

The charity Medical Aid for Palestinians said that after six weeks of Israel’s siege on the territory, food is running out. “We must stand together to protect Gaza’s children, who will go to bed tonight hungry,” the group said in a social media post, urging an immediate ceasefire.   Ghassan Abu Sittah, a doctor who worked at both Gaza’s al-Shifa and al-Alhi Arab hospitals, says Israel’s destruction of Gaza’s health sector is part of a military strategy that aims to wipe out Palestinians. “What has been different in this war than all the other wars I have been at – not just in Gaza, but all around the region, in Yemen, Iraq and Syria – is that the destruction of the healthcare system has been the main thrust of the [Israeli] military strategy,” Abu Sittah told Al Jazeera. He said 800,000 people now do not have access to healthcare, including wounded Palestinians who are “only being bandaged up the best that they could be” due to a lack of supplies. “We had over 500 wounded in the grounds of al-Ahli [Arab] Hospital when we ran out of medication,” he said. “I honestly and truly believe that this is part of the military strategy. Those patients are going to die. Anybody who was lucky enough to survive the initial assault and the Israeli strategy was to destroy the healthcare system so that they do not survive their wounds. “It is obvious that this is a genocidal war.”  In an openletterpublished in The New York Review of Books, the scholars expressed their “dismay and disappointment at political leaders and notable public figures invoking Holocaust memory to explain the current crisis in Gaza and Israel”. They pointed to recent comments from Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, who compared Hamas to Nazis, as well as US President Biden, who said the Palestinian group had “engaged in barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust”. “It is understandable why many in the Jewish community recall the Holocaust and earlier pogroms when trying to comprehend what happened on October 7,” said the open letter’s signatories, which included professors in Canada, Germany, Israel, the US and the UK. “However, appealing to the memory of the Holocaust obscures our understanding of the antisemitism Jews face today, and dangerously misrepresents the causes of violence in Israel-Palestine,” they said, adding that the Israeli occupation and blockade of Gaza are among those root causes. “Israeli leaders and others are using the Holocaust framing to portray Israel’s collective punishment of Gaza as a battle for civilization in the face of barbarism, thereby promoting racist narratives about Palestinians,” the scholars wrote. “There is no military solution in Israel-Palestine, and deploying a Holocaust narrative in which an ‘evil’ must be vanquished by force will only perpetuate an oppressive state of affairs that has already lasted far too long.”  This is a modal window.

Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch (HRW), said it was the second time a speaking arrangement had been cancelled by the US university. He said the planned talk, which was organised by the activist group Students for Palestine, had been cancelled 30 minutes before it was set to start after Columbia said “security approvals not raised before were required”. The incident comes as universities across the US have cracked down on pro-Palestine groups. Columbia University previously suspended two student groups – Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace – saying they had violated university policies related to campus events. In a post on social media, Shakir said the planned talk at Columbia would happen “soon”. “Those suppressing discussion of Israeli apartheid are on wrong side of history,” he said.    ",
Is­raeli army says it found a 55-me­tre tun­nel un­der Gaza’s al-Shi­fa Hos­pi­tal,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/israeli-army-says-it-found-a-55-metre-tunnel-under-gazas-al-shifa-hospital,"Military publishes video of what it describes as a tunnel, running 55 metres in length and dug under the medical facility. The Israeli army claims it has uncovered a tunnel shaft under the beleaguered al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza. In a statement on Sunday, the army said it found a 55-metre-long (180 ft), 10-metre-deep (32 ft) tunnel under Gaza’slargest medical facility, which has been under siege by Israeli troops for several days. The army published a video on its official Telegram channel showing a soldier lowering himself into the tunnel. The footage was shot with two separate cameras on November 17, it said. The videos show a staircase leading to an arched concrete passage that ends in what appears to be a door. The army says it is the entrance of the tunnel shaft with “a blast-proof door and a firing hole”. According to the statement, the tunnel was found “in the area of the hospital underneath a shed alongside a vehicle containing numerous weapons including RPGs, explosives, and Kalashnikov rifles”. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters the entrance was uncovered when a military bulldozer knocked down the outside wall of the hospital complex and found a fortified shaft with a spiral staircase descending 10 metres. “It’s a huge one which has metal [spiral] stairs, then it goes along for 55 metres… and reaches a blast door,” said Hagari, indicating that troops had not yet tried to open the door for fear it would be booby-trapped. Beyond the door, intelligence suggested either the tunnel would split or there would be “a big room for command and control”, he added, saying troops would continue searching the area as there could be access shafts from nearby houses. Israel has made al-Shifa Hospital a focal point of its operations since the army entered it on Wednesday, claiming it harbours a Hamas command centre – a claim Hamas as well as staff working at the hospital have denied. “It’s probably one out of dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of tunnels. We all know there are tunnels in Gaza,” Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said. “The problem is not finding a tunnel. The problem is the Israeli excuse – and their supporters in London and Washington too – that there was ‘a city under a city’.”  The Israeli army on Sunday also said that a captive soldier was executed and two foreign captives held at al-Shifa Hospital. The army is searching for some 240 people Hamas kidnapped to Gaza after the October 7 cross-border assault. One of the hostages was a 19-year-old Israeli army conscript, Noa Marciano, whose body was recovered near al-Shifa last week. Hamas said she died in an Israeli air strike and issued a video that appeared to show her corpse, unmarked except for a head wound. The Israeli military said a forensic examination found she had sustained non-life-threatening injuries from such a strike. “According to intelligence information – solid intelligence information – Noa was taken by Hamas terrorists inside the walls of Shifa hospital. There, she was murdered by a Hamas terrorist,” Hagari said without elaborating. In his televised briefing, Hagari said Hamas attackers had also brought a Nepalese and a Thai captive, among foreign workers seized in the October 7 raid, to al-Shifa. He did not name the two hostages. Hamas did not immediately comment on Hagari’s statements. It previously said it took some hostages to hospitals for treatment. At least 13,000 Palestinians, 5,500 of them children, have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its air and ground assault, the Gaza health ministry said. The siege of al-Shifa Hospital, the focal point of the six-week “genocide”, has sparked international outcry, with the World Health Organization describing it as a “death zone” when its team visited the facility on Saturday. More than 7,000 people, including patients in critical condition and newborn babies fighting for their lives, were sheltered inside al-Shifa before those who were able to move were forced out this weekend. Thirty-one premature babies were evacuated on Sunday and taken to the European and Nasser hospitals in the south of the Gaza Strip. According to reports from medical staff inside al-Shifa, some patients remain at the hospital and were interrogated earlier on Sunday.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

When will Is­raeli army ex­plain in­con­sis­ten­cies in al-Shi­fa Hos­pi­tal videos?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/when-will-israeli-army-explain-inconsistencies-in-al-shifa-hospital-videos,"No explanation yet as to why the occupation army removed a video from X and reposted a shorter, edited version the next day. It has been nearly five days since the Israeli army deleted a social media post that alleged Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital was used as a control and command centre by Hamas before it was occupied. The army removed the original post on Wednesday, replacing it with a shorter versionrepostedwith an edit the next day. No explanation for the deletion of the post was given by the Israeli military. “We are going to do a one-shot video, one shot, no editing of all the evidence that we have found just now in this building of al-Shifa Hospital,” army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said at the beginning of both versions of the video. However, it is clearly visible that the footage was edited in the frame that is six minutes and 26 seconds into the latest and shorter version of the video. In the video, Conricus walks the viewers through what the Israeli military says is evidence of the presence of Hamas fighters in Gaza’s largest health facility, featuring combat gear and weapons among other items. Plastic bags purportedly containing what the army describes as “hospital equipment” are among the items displayed in the video.  However, a close analysis of the contents of the plastic bags shows that what the Israeli army referred to as “hospital equipment” are actually bandages and ointments. Their presence at the hospital, according to the Israeli military spokesman, renders Gaza’s dire need for medical supplies and equipment a fabrication. He also shows the viewers a laptop along with a few CDs, claiming they contain valuable intelligence. In the new version of the video, however, the same laptop is blurred. In the original video, one could see its screen in focus, revealing the computer’s model: Lenovo ThinkPad L460, a laptop that comes without a CD reader. Television footage published by BBC andFox Newsreporters, embedded with the Israeli army in Gaza, reveal further inconsistencies, documenting how the scene at the hospital was apparently altered. The reporters were escorted to the facility’s MRI room and filmed what they were told was evidence that Hamas fighters had been there. In their videos, one can see two AK-47 rifles at the scene – instead of the one AK-47 in the original video shared by the Israeli army.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

The BBC’s ownfact-checking analysisalso highlighted that its reporter was only allowed into the scene a few hours after the Israeli army recorded its video – as was evident from the time on the Israeli army’s spokesman’s wristwatch. In a statement reported by Israel’s national media, the military denied claims that it had manipulated the scene at al-Shifa. “In certain areas, explosives had to be relocated, managed and mines and charges had to be taken away. Only after that could they be brought back to the same room to show the international media,” it said. The inconsistencies in the videos raise serious questions over alleged changes made to the scene. It is vital that these questions are answered as Israel uses such so-called evidence as justification to target hospitals in its war on Gaza. Furthermore, the so-called evidence still falls short of confirming the Israeli army’s claim of a Hamas command-and-control headquarters inside al-Shifa Hospital.  This is a modal window.

‘Saw death in every colour’: Pales­tini­ans flee­ing north Gaza re­count hor­ror,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/19/saw-death-in-every-colour-palestinians-fleeing-north-gaza-recount-horror,"In Pictures Central Gaza Strip –Thousands of displaced Palestinians have been forced to leave Gaza City and northern Gaza, making their way to the central region of the coastal territory under attack by Israel. But many Palestinians described the so-called “safe corridors” that Israel announced to allow for their evacuation as replete with horror. Ahmad al-Ruweishi had been staying at Al Fakhoura school in the Jabalia refugee camp when the Israeli army bombed it on Saturday, killing at least 100 civilians. He said he helped move the remains of at least 20 people killed, as their bodies were torn into pieces. “I had to leave to protect my family,” he said. “It was a tough journey and the soldiers shot at me just because I was pushing my mother in her wheelchair.” Al-Ruweishi said the Israeli soldiers made the men strip naked and arrested some of them. “You could not look behind you, and if you dropped anything, they would shoot if you bent down to pick it up,” he said. The United Nations says at least 1.6 million Palestinians have been internally displaced, with a majority of them staying at UN-run schools. Others are staying with host families or in hospitals. For weeks, the Israeli military has called on the Palestinians in northern Gaza to flee to the south, but has continued to target and bomb civilians even there. “We saw death in every colour on Salah al-Din Street,” said Mahmoud al-Madhoun, referring to the main arterial road that connects the north with the south. “We saw burned-out cars and dead bodies on the road, with dogs eating away at their flesh,” he said. “We couldn’t even dignify them by covering them up with blankets.” Al-Madhoun was staying at al-Shifa Hospital before he managed to leave on Saturday. He narrated the terror that patients and displaced people at the hospital felt when Israeli soldiers raided the complex and targeted it with bombs. “When we were able to finally leave the hospital, there were Israeli snipers stationed at the roads,” he said. “They had erected dirt barriers and used surveillance technology that took our eye print. It was frightening. We never thought we would see the soldiers in the heart of our city where we lived and worked.” As there were no cars or even ambulances for the sick and injured, al-Madhoun said, they covered the long journey on foot. He said the Israeli soldiers ordered them to hold their IDs in hand. He also saw men, women and children being taken away by the soldiers, their fate unknown. “These are not ‘safe corridors’, these are ‘deception corridors,’” he said. “They humiliate us, take us away, or shoot at us.”",
Yemen’s Houthi rebels seize car­go ship in Red Sea,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/yemens-houthi-rebels-seize-cargo-ship-in-red-sea-israel-blames-iran,"Houthi spokesperson says the group’s fighters have hijacked the ship, reportedly owned by an Israeli businessman. Yemen’s Houthis say they have taken control of a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea as thewar in Gazasends tensions soaring in the region. The Houthis, who control northern Yemen and its Red Sea coast, said the ship was Israeli, but Israel described it as a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo vessel with no Israeli nationals on board. Some 25 people are believed to have been on board the Galaxy Leader – reported to be partly owned by an Israeli businessman and sailing under the flag of Bahamas – when it was seized en route from Turkey to India. Ownership details in public shipping databases associated the ship’s owners with Ray Car Carriers, founded by Abraham “Rami” Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel. Ungar told The Associated Press news agency he was aware of the incident but could not comment as he awaited details. A ship linked to himexperienced an explosionin 2021 in the Gulf of Oman. Israeli media blamed it on Iran at the time. International shipping often involves a series of management companies, flags and owners stretching across the globe in a single vessel. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the seizure of the ship was in response to the “heinous acts against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza and the West Bank”. “If the international community is concerned about regional security and stability, rather than expanding the conflict, it should put an end to Israel’s aggression against Gaza,” he wrote on X. The Houthis have launched several missile and droneattacks against Israelsince October 7, when an attack by Hamas inside Israel prompted an Israeli ground and air offensive on Gaza. Last week, the Iran-aligned Houthis said they could target Israeli ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. Saree renewed the warning that any ship belonging to Israel or those who support it will be a legitimate target for Houthi forces. “We confirm our continuation of military operations against [Israel] until the aggression and ugly crimes against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza and the West Bank stop,” said Saree.

Iran un­veils up­grad­ed hy­per­son­ic mis­sile as Khamenei touts Is­rael ‘fail­ure’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/iran-unveils-upgraded-hypersonic-missile-as-khamenei-touts-israel-failure,"The Iranian show of force comes amid heightened US military presence in the region after Israel began bombing Gaza. Tehran, Iran –Iran has unveiled an upgraded version of its hypersonic missile in a military exhibition for the country’s supreme leader. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday visited a university run by the aerospace division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Tehran, where a more advanced version of theFattah hypersonic missilewas put on display along with an array of arms, including the Iranian-made Gaza drone. A new version of theShahed series of unmanned aerial vehiclesand an upgraded version of the 9-Dey missile defence system, capable of launching short to medium-range projectiles, were also unveiled. The IRGC in addition displayed a new missile defence system called Mehran, which is said to employ solid-fuel missiles. Iran had first unveiled the missile in June, joining a small club of countries, including China and Russia, which have weapons capable of travelling long distances with strong maneuverability. The Iranian state media said the Fattah II missile is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), a projectile that glides to its target after the initial launch, offering substantially more maneuverability compared to a ballistic warhead travelling in a more predictable arc pattern.

No more information was provided on the upgraded version on Sunday, but Iran had said Fattah is capable of moving at a speed of up to Mach 15 (5.1 km or 3.2 miles per second) with a range of 1,400km (870 miles). IRGC officials had said in June that the elite force couldlook to improve its range of hypersonicsto 2,000km (1,242 miles), which would effectively cover the distance to Iran’s regional archenemy, Israel. The Iranian supreme leader on Sunday again condemned Israel and its Western allies for their war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 12,000 Palestinians, nearly half of them children. Khamenei said “the Zionist regime is a symbol of racism”, adding that Western backing for the weeks-long bombing of the enclave means Western leaders “also believe in racism and see nothing wrong with it”. He saidbrutal attacks on hospitals in Gazaindicate anger on the part of Israeli leaders due to their “failure” in defeating Palestinian fighters. “The Islamic governments must sever their political relations with the Zionist regime at least for a limited time,” Khamenei said, also calling on the Muslim states to cut the flow of energy and goods to Israel. The Iranian military show of force came as the United States moved considerable military assets, including two carrier strike groups and a nuclear submarine, to the region. Under the umbrella of the Iran-backed “resistance axis” of political and armed groups across the region, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthis have been engaged in cross-border fighting with Israel since last month in solidarity with Hamas fighters. Israel on Sunday said the Houthis seized a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship in the southern Red Sea, describing the indent as an “Iranian act of terrorism”. ",
Ba­bies evac­u­at­ed from al-Shi­fa Hos­pi­tal to south­ern Gaza amid Is­rael war,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/babies-evacuated-from-al-shifa-and-transferred-to-southern-gaza,"Thirty-one premature babies, trapped in hospital without life-sustaining equipment, have been evacuated by ambulance. The most vulnerable patients atal-Shifa Hospital– dozens of prematurely born babies in critical condition – have been evacuated to the south of the Gaza Strip. Of the39 babieswho had been left without incubators when al-Shifa Hospital was left short of fuel and medical supplies afterIsraeli forces raided on Wednesday, 31 have made it out. Mohammed Zaqout, director-general of hospitals in Gaza, told journalists that “all 31 premature babies in al-Shifa Hospital … have been evacuated” along with three doctors and two nurses, and “preparations are under way” for them to enter Egypt. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, said the babies were on their way to southern Gaza hospitals. Six Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances transported them, in an effort coordinated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the group said in a post on its Facebook page. Israeli forcesordereddoctors, patients and displaced people at Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital to evacuate the medical compound, forcing some to leave by gunpoint, doctors and Palestinian officials told Al Jazeera on Saturday. A WHO team that visited the hospital on Saturday reported that there were still hundreds of patients there, including many in extremely critical condition, trauma patients with severely infected wounds, and others with spinal injuries who are unable to move. “Patients and health staff with whom they spoke were terrified for their safety and health, and pleaded for evacuation,” the agency said, describing al-Shifa as a death zone. Doctors said that four babies had died during the raid. The babies were transferred to the south of Gaza “in preparation for their transfer to the Emirates Hospital in Rafah”, the PRCS said. Later in the day, Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza, told a news conference that the babies had been moved to Tal al-Sultan Hospital in Rafah and will be sent to Egyptian hospitals with their families tomorrow.",
‘Boy­cott Is­rael’ breathes new life into 100-year-old Egypt­ian soda brand,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/19/boycott-israel-breathes-new-life-into-100-year-old-egyptian-soda-brand,"Campaign to boycott Western producers linked to Israel has reignited demand for soda brand founded by Greek beekeeper. Cairo, Egypt– Spiro Spathis, Egypt’s oldest carbonated drinks company, is having a sensational comeback. Founded in 1920 by a Greek beekeeper from Kefalonia whose name it bears, “Spathis” has been part of life for generations of Egyptians. Now, thanks to a nationwide campaign to boycott Western producers supportive of Israel, the century-old brand is causing a stir as the poster child for Egyptian solidarity with Palestinians. Spiro Spathis, which has always been proud of its role as Egypt’s first soft drink brand, is rolling out slogans like “100% Made in Egypt” and “Egypt’s original gazouza”, using an Egyptian term thought to derive from the French “gazeuse” (carbonated) and widely used to refer to fizzy drinks. “I’ve been selling their drinks for four years. There were always a few consumers who preferred Spiro over other drinks, but not many,” Mohammed, who owns a grocery store in Sharqia governorate, said. “But now, their bottles run out almost instantly. Before the boycott, I would sell four, maybe five, boxes of Spathis in a week, now I can sell as many as 50 boxes in a day if I have that many in stock,” he continued, adding that the surge in demand is “massive”. “Demand has tripled over the past month,” Morcus Talaat, the company’s head of marketing and one of three siblings who own the firm, told Al Jazeera. Talaat spoke to Al Jazeera between back-to-back meetings at the no-frills, two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment in an upscale Cairo neighbourhood where Sprio Spathis has its headquarters. “We’ve received hundreds of calls from new clients… offers from restaurants.” Spiro Spathis has gone on a recruitment drive and received more than 15,000 applicants for jobs it advertised to try to meet the demand. In Cairo’s neighbourhood of Nasr City, a kiosk owner says he has not been able to source enough Spathis to meet the demand. “I’ve only had four deliveries in the past month, and it gets sold out on the same day. Previously, Spathis’ stocks lasted longer.” Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, which began on October 7 and has so far killed more than 11,500 Palestinians, has prompted mass protests around the world. It has also caused many toboycott international brands like McDonald’sand Starbucks. In Indonesia, consumers began boycotting Mcdonald’s and other businesses in mid-October after McDonald’s Israel announced on social media that it had handed out thousands of free meals to the Israeli military during its war on Gaza. The announcement prompted several organisations, including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS), the United People Front (FUB) and the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), to call for a boycott of McDonald’s and other businesses perceived to be pro-Israel, including Burger King. As protesters flood the streets of major cities around the globe, from Washington, DC, to London and Cape Town, branches of franchise restaurants, coffee shops and stores that were once bustling in the Arab World are largely empty. “Boycotting is a form of popular tool for people to make themselves heard, and is the most powerful means to pressure Western colonialism and capitalism-fuelled states,” said Jamal Zahran, political science professor at the University of Suez. “Boycotting these products also creates opportunities for local products.” Since the start of the war, Egyptians have been using social media to exchange information about which brands are considered supportive of Israel and should be avoided. Some apps are also listing alternatives to Western brands, highlighting local producers of equal or similar quality. “Is it with us, or not?” is a question frequently asked on Meta posts about various brands, as people research which to give up. The result has been the rediscovery of local substitutes like Spiro Spathis, which was once the only soda drinks manufacturer in the Arab world’s most populous country. But, as other international brands entered the market about 70 years ago, then flooded the local market, it was sidelined. Spiro Spathis even shut its doors altogether in 2014, Talaat said. “We’re the second generation of Egyptians to own the firm. Our father bought the company in 1998 and ran it up until he passed away in 2009. In 2014, we closed down Spiro Spathis, before returning again in 2019, and have been present in the market every single day since,” he added. Although it is not the only local soda drinks company in Egypt, Spathis is being lauded by many online users in Egypt as the best. Trending on social media, the company’s history and logo have gained attention and stirred the curiosity of younger generations not familiar with the brand. “Why is there a fly in its logo?” some asked on social media. According to Talaat, the century-old logo is, in fact, a bee, not a fly, marking the founder’s original profession as a beekeeper on the Greek island of Kefalonia. Social media users also joked about the difficulty of finding a Spathis soda because of the increased demand and limited supply. “I’m trying to find myself, and Spiro Spathis,” quipped one Meta user. “We’re working around the clock to meet the surge in demand,” said Talaat. “Since October 7, we’ve been executing a year’s plans of expansions, growth and distribution in a period of a month to meet the market’s needs.” Besides expanding geographically, increasing production of its eight flavours and hiring teams to address consumer feedback and manage distributors’ orders, Talaat also said the company is planning to add a new cola flavour that customers asked for to replace the colas being boycotted in Egypt. Since the war, Egyptian social media users have noted offers and discounts for Western-made products they have turned their backs on. Many have also engaged in online debates about the efficiency of such boycotts which some see as harming the livelihoods of Egyptian workers employed by franchises. Sahar Azazi, 31, who lives in Cairo, said boycotting brands is the most obvious action to take. “It’s the least we can do to support Palestinians under attack, and it is not a temporary action on my part. I won’t be eating or drinking something that has made the murder of an innocent Palestinian possible,” she said, adding that Spiro Spathis as a local product is just as good as the drinks she’s given up. “They’re not as available, though, since the boycott began,” she noted. For Talaat, Spiro Spathis is very much back in business. “We plan to be there for Egyptian consumers always, even if the boycott doesn’t last. We’re here to stay,” he said.

"Dis­eases spread in Gaza amid wa­ter and sewage cri­sis, cholera feared",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/diseases-spread-in-gaza-amid-water-and-sewage-crisis-cholera-feared,"Gastrointestinal diseases and respiratory and skin infections are rising amid Israel war, UN agencies say. Khan Younis, Gaza –Sewage flows in the streets of Gaza as all keysanitation serviceshave ceased operating, raising the alarming prospect of an enormous surge of gastrointestinal and infectious diseases among the local populations – including cholera. For Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, finding drinkable water has become close to impossible. At a school run by the United Nations relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Khan Younis, 33-year-old Osama Saqr attempted to fill some bottles with water for his thirsty children. He took a sip and grimaced in disgust at the saltiness of the fluid, before letting out a long sigh. “It’s polluted and unsuitable, but my children always drink it, there’s no alternative,” he told Al Jazeera. Saqr’s one-year-old son has diarrhoea but he cannot find medicines in hospitals or pharmacies to treat him. “Even if I find it, the problem remains, the water is polluted and salty water, not suitable for drinking,” he said. “I’m afraid that eventually, I’m going to lose one of my children to this poisoning.” The World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded more than 44,000 cases of diarrhoea and 70,000 acute respiratory infections, but real numbers may be significantly higher. On Friday, the UN agency said it was extremely concerned that rains and floods during the approaching winter season will make an already dire situation even worse. “We are hearing about several hundred people per toilet at the UNRWA centres and those have been overflowing, so people are doing open defecation,” Richard Brennan, regional emergency director for the Eastern Mediterranean region at WHO, told Al Jazeera. “They have to find a place to go to the bathroom in the grounds where they are staying. That’s a huge public health risk and also very humiliating.” Brennan said overcrowding, lack of solid waste management, poor sanitation and open-air defecation were all contributing to the spread of diseases including diarrhoea, respiratory infections and skin infections, including scabies. UN agencies have warned that the collapse of water and sanitation servicescould even spark bouts of choleraif urgent humanitarian aid is not delivered. If nothing changes, “there will be more and more people falling sick and the risk of major outbreaks will increase dramatically,” Brennan said. Gaza’s essential water and sanitation infrastructure has either been destroyed by Israeli bombardment or has run out of fuel. In the southern governorates of Deir el-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah, all 76 water wells have stopped functioning, as well as two main drinking water plants and 15 sewage pumping stations, according to the UNRWA. WHO estimates that the average person in Gaza is currently consuming just 3 litres of water per day for drinking and sanitation. This compares with the minimum of 7.5 litres recommended by the agency in emergency situations. The halt of key services including water desalination plants, sewage treatment and hospitals has led to a 40 percent increase in diarrhoea for people taking shelter in UNRWA schools, the agency said. It estimated that about 70 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people – more than half of whom are children – no longer have access to clean water. On Wednesday, Israeli authorities allowed just over 23,000 litres (6,000 gallons) of fuel to be brought into the Strip via Egypt. But they restricted the use of this fuel to trucks transporting the little aid coming in. The UNRWA said it needed 160,000 litres (42,000 gallons) of fuel a day for basic humanitarian operations.

This seriously paralyses our work and the delivery of assistance to the Palestinian communities in Gaza.” The Ministry of Health in Gaza has warned that the lack of clean water caused by fuel shortages has put the lives of 1,100 patients with kidney failure, including 38 children, particularly at risk. Among them is Samer Abdeen’s 22-year-old brother, Muhammad, who has been suffering from acute renal colic due to the poor water quality. “When he is in great pain, he screams,” Abdeen, 40, told Al Jazeera as he searched the streets of Khan Younis for bottled water to buy. While bottled water is now expensive and very hard to find, he refused to give up the search. “I don’t want to lose him in this unjust war,” he said. Sixty-year-old Samir Asaad, from Deir el-Balah camp, suffers from high blood pressure, which is exacerbated by drinking salty water. “I heat up the water over a fire to drink it so I don’t feel its saltiness,” he said. “They are killing us from thirst or forcing us to drink any water so that we die anyway,” he said, referring to the Israeli siege on Gaza. Humanitarian officials are calling for more aid to enter Gaza. The World Food Programme warned on Thursday that supplies of food and water were almost non-existent in Gaza and that civilians were facing the immediate possibility of dehydration and starvation. Some residents resorted to digging wells to extract water, despite it being contaminated by the sewage and solid waste piling up untreated on the streets. Asaad said his family prefers to line up for hours to fill bottles at filling stations, but they are under no illusion that the water there will be any safer to drink. Umi al-Abadla, deputy director general of primary care at Gaza’s health ministry, said water reaching the filling station used to be treated before being pumped, but this is no longer possible due to the lack of fuel. “As a result of the power outage, water is distributed from random wells whose water is contaminated,” he said. “This has caused diarrhoea among children, more than the annual average.” He added that the lack of personal hygiene as a result of the mass displacement was causing a spread of skin diseases as well as viral diseases including chickenpox, and raising the threat of epidemics of diseases including cholera. Desperate to quench their thirst, some in Gaza have resorted to drinking seawater. But, with sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants out of operation due to the lack of fuel, more than 130,000 cubic metres of wastewater are being discharged into the Mediterranean Sea each day. Salwa Islim, 45, said she and her familygo to the sea to batheand sometimes drink from it. “I am forced to drink seawater and people here also do that,” she told Al Jazeera. “Where is our right to water? What is this war that prevents all citizens from eating, drinking and all the other necessities of life?” she said. “Is this a punishment for the children, who ask every day when the war will end? They stand in the streets and ask for bottles of water to drink. But there is no drinking water in Gaza”.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

"‘Hor­ri­fy­ing’: Dozens re­port­ed killed in Is­raeli at­tacks on camps, schools",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/horrifying-dozens-reported-killed-in-israeli-attacks-on-camps-schools,"At least 31 people killed in Israeli attacks on the Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps, officials say. Israeli air raids have killed dozens of people, including children, in northern, central, and southern Gaza, Palestinian officials and media have said, as the besieged territory endures its44th dayof bombardment. At least 31 people were killed in Israeli attacks on the Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps in central Gaza, the Ministry of Health in the Hamas-governed enclave said on Sunday. A woman and her child were also killed in strikes in southern Khan Younis city, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Israeli forces also shot dead two people, including a disabled man, during incursions in the occupied West Bank, Wafa reported. Issam al-Fayed, a 46-year-old disabled man, was killed at the entrance of the Jenin refugee camp, while 20-year-old Omar Laham was killed at the Dheisheh refugee camp south of Bethlehem, Wafa said.

The killings come on the heels ofdevastating assaultson schools and refugee camps in northern Gaza. At least 50 people were killed in an attack on Al Fakhoura school in the Jabalia refugee camp on Saturday, Gaza’s Health Ministry said, while dozens of casualties were reported from an attack on a second school in Tall az-Zaatar. “The scenes were horrifying. Corpses of women and children were on the ground. Others were screaming for help,” Ahmed Radwan, a wounded survivor of Al Fakhoura attack, told The Associated Press news agency. “Dead bodies [are] scattered … pieces of flesh”, an unnamed witness told Al Jazeera. “No one can recognise their sons. Our life is hell.” Marwan Bishara, a senior political analyst for Al Jazeera, said Al Fakhoura school could be described as the “al-Shifa of schools” as it has been repeatedly hit by Israeli forces like al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical facility, which has been a major target of Israel’s military campaign. “There is nothing discriminate about the fact that a school that shelters thousands of people has been bombed from the air; that is meant to create damage, human loss, suffering and death,” Bishara said.

Meanwhile,al-Shifa Hospitalcontinued to be the focus of humanitarian concerns as hundreds of people fled the facility on foot on orders from the Israeli army, according to its director. Columns of sick and injured – some of them amputees – were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors, and nurses on Saturday, as loud explosions were heard around the complex. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, described “horrifying images” of the scene, while Egypt called the bombing a “war crime” and “a deliberate insult to the United Nations”. A World Health Organization assessment team on Sunday said 291 patients were left at the hospital. They included 32 babies in extremely critical condition, trauma patients with severely infected wounds and others with spinal injuries who are unable to move, the UN health agency said. Since Palestinian group Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israeli territory on October 7, Israel has waged a devastating air and ground assault on Gaza,killingat least 11,500 people, more than a third of them children, according to Gaza officials. The 44-day war has displaced some 1.5 million Palestinians, wrecked much of the territory’s infrastructure and sparked a desperate humanitarian crisis, aid workers say.",
‘Giv­ing up is not an op­tion’: Vol­un­teer doc­tors at Al-Aqsa Mar­tyrs Hos­pi­tal,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/giving-up-is-not-an-option-volunteer-doctors-at-al-aqsa-martyrs-hospital,"Volunteers experience gruelling hours, face lack of medical supplies and a collapse of healthcare system in the Gaza Strip. Deir el-Balah, Gaza –Abdelrahman Abu Shawish did not expect to be making life-altering decisions for his patients so soon after graduating from medical school at Gaza’s Azhar University. The 25-year-old, who lives with his family in the Nuseirat refugee camp, began volunteering in the surgical department of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital on October 10 and found himself deciding whether a wounded person requires a full or partial amputation of their limbs. “The injuries that I saw in the [May] 2021 war more or less looked the same,” he told Al Jazeera. “But this time around, I’ve seen so many different types, from varying degrees of burns to amputated limbs, to deep lacerations and different types of shrapnel.” The hospital, which was meant to serve the central town of Deir el-Balah, has become the Gaza Strip’s main treatment facility due to the complete collapse of hospitals in Gaza City and northern Gaza. Nearly two-thirds of the strip’s hospitals – 26 out of 35 – have stopped functioning following weeks of bombardment by Israeli forces on the territory, which began on October 7. At least 1.5 million Palestinians have been displaced from their homes and the massive aerial and ground assault on Gaza has destroyed much of its infrastructure, including more than half the homes. Furthermore, the total siege imposed by Israel on the enclave means hospitals have run out of fuel, electricity and clean water. “We have very limited medical supplies,” Abu Shawish said. “When dozens of wounded people come to the hospital as a result of an Israeli attack, we often can’t treat them all at once because we need to sterilise our tools as we don’t have enough.” The lack of resources means doctors can do little more than the minimum required to keep their patients alive. Proper treatment is out of the question. “We’re unable to remove all the shrapnel from a wounded person’s body, only the pieces that threaten their lives,” Abu Shawish explained. “That’s still dangerous, as shrapnel can cause infections that lead to multiple organ failure, but we hope they can follow up once the war is over.” The young doctor, who had studied German in preparation for going to Germany for his residency, said he has had to downgrade his aspirations for his career. “I had big dreams before the war but now I just hope for me and my family to stay alive,” he said. After his family home was destroyed in the Israeli shelling of the al-Zahra neighbourhood south of Gaza City, Mohammad Abu Salem began volunteering at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital on October 19 and has only seen his family twice since then. Also just 25 years old, Abu Salem, who specialised in physiotherapy at the Islamic University in Gaza City, said Israeli massacres of Palestinians have become an everyday reality in the Gaza Strip. “I knew working in a hospital in general would be hectic, but working in a hospital during a war is on a whole new different level,” he said. “You don’t know what is going to happen tomorrow, whether you will live or die. But giving up is not an option.” The physiotherapy department sees all patients after their initial treatment in the emergency room, after which they go on to other departments such as the surgical unit or paediatric wing. Abu Salem talks to patients about the nature of their wounds, the complications that might arise, and how to avoid such risks. “The other day my own brother came in injured – thankfully it wasn’t serious,” he said. “But the stress of treating people you know… can be very debilitating.” In the emergency room, Alaa Kassab points out patients whose limbs have turned blue, explaining that shrapnel has likely done so much damage that the limb isn’t oxygenating and may need to be amputated. Incidents like this, especially the large number of children she has seen lose limbs to amputation, have impacted her to the point where she is not able to speak sometimes. Instead of talking to her family at home, she needs to sit in silence to recover most days. Kassab finished her medical studies at the Ain Shams University in Cairo and returned to her hometown of Deir el-Balah last February. “I had this dream of finishing my medical internship year, then travelling overseas to complete my studies by specialising, before eventually going back to Gaza,” she said. “What I’ve seen in the past two weeks since volunteering has only made me more determined to be a doctor.” The hours are long and gruelling, and Kassab has never seen some of the wounds she is having to treat now. “There isn’t a day where we can rest,” she said, adding that she works from noon until 3am the following day. “The number of wounded people never lets up. It’s why I decided to volunteer, because I knew that doctors are under an immense amount of pressure and the situation is very tough.” Kassab said the hospital is nearing a total collapse of services. Without enough surgical tools, fuel, medical supplies or personnel, they will soon not be able to treat any more patients, she said. “Of course, I am here to serve my people, and I don’t regret that for a second,” she said. “But the situation in the Gaza Strip is very bad.”",

The Israeli attack on theAl Fakhoura schoolwas the most “grave attack that there’s been”, Maleiha Malik, the executive director of Protect Education in Insecurity and Conflict (PEIC), has told Al Jazeera. Malik described the attack on the school, which was being used a shelter, as a “flagrant breach of international humanitarian law” and called for an “independent commission to establish the truth of what’s going on and establish accountability”.

It’s just after 1am on Monday (23:00 GMT) in the occupied Palestinian territories and in Israel. Here’s a recap of the developments over the last few hours. Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem The Israeli army is essentially trying to prove the claims it has been peddling, not just in this war but for years, that Hamas is using al-Shifa and the area underneath it as a military headquarters. Essentially calling it the Pentagon of Hamas’s military operations. They showed an opening in the ground where they then descended a camera 10 metres (32 ft) down to show that the tunnel, according to them, was 50 metres (164 ft) long and ended with a door that is a protective barrier with a firing hole inside of it. Now the Israeli army has been releasing small bits of information in the form of photos and videos to try and prove their claims. But they have not shown sufficient evidence to back those up.

Hamas has responded after Israel released a CCTV video it claimed to show two captives being brought to al-Shifa Hospital on October 7. “The statements of the occupation army regarding the use of al-Shifa Hospital to detain Zionist prisoners are misleading and false. The occupation’s statements aim to cover up its security and military failures,” the group said in a statement. In an earlier briefing, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Hamas attackers brought a Nepalese and a Thai national into the medical facility. They were among the foreign workers seized in the raid. He did not name the two hostages.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

The comments come after Haaretz.com reported that an Israeli military helicopter responding to the Hamas attack at a music festival may have shot civilians. “I don’t think a serious investigation is taking place. There are so many things to be investigated. So many question marks, so many mysteries. Unprecedented behaviour of the army, of the police, everyone,” Levy told Al Jazeera. “Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t take any accountability and he’s not going to. He didn’t know, he didn’t see… But after the war, there’s no doubt public opinion will demand a serious investigation by a serious committee.”  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

At least 13,000 Palestinians have been killed and 30,000 wounded in Gaza since Israel launched its attacks following October 7. At least 5,500 of the dead are children and 3,500 are women, Gaza’s government media office said. Israel says about 1,200 people died in the Hamas attack on October 7. Gaza’s health ministry is the only official source for Gaza casualties. Israel has sealed Gaza’s borders, barring foreign journalists and humanitarian workers. In previous wars, the ministry’s counts have held up to UN scrutiny, independent investigations and even Israel’s tallies.

Updates on Khan Younis in southern Gaza, al-Shifa Hospital’s refugees, raids in the occupied West Bank and rumours of a deal for Israeli captives:  Reporting from Washington, DC We just got a response to this from the US National Security Council, the top body of advisers to the White House. “The Houthi’s seizure of the vessel Galaxy Leader in the Red Sea is a flagrant violation of international law. We demand the immediate release of the ship and its crew. We will consult with our UN partners for the appropriate next steps.” The US has beefed up its presence since the start of the war in the seas of the Middle East. They sent two aircraft carriers with accompanying warships in their words “to assist with the defence of Israel”. But they obviously haven’t been able to prevent this happening in this case.   ",
"Hamas had not planned to at­tack mu­sic fes­ti­val, Is­raeli re­port says",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/18/hamas-had-not-planned-to-attack-israel-music-festival-israeli-report-says,"First police investigation of Supernova festival also found Israeli forces responsible for some deaths. Hamas fighters whoattacked a music festivalin Israel on October 7, killing hundreds, likely did not know in advance about the event and decided to target it on the spot, Israeli media has reported citing police and security sources. According to a copy of the first Israeli police report into the attack, obtained this week by Israel’s Channel 12, Palestinian fighters had originally intended to attack nearby kibbutz Re’im as well as other villages near the Gaza border. They found out about the music festival with drones and from the air as they parachuted into Israel. Some 4,400 people had reportedly been at the event that Saturday when Hamas broke through Israel’s high-security barrier – which includes radar system and underground sensors – and attacked military posts and villages in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities. This Saturday, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the “growing assessment in Israel’s security establishment” based on the police investigation and on interrogations of captured Hamas members, is that the group had not planned to target the event. While police found maps of the target locations on the bodies of killed Hamas members, none was of the festival location. An additional finding supporting the assessment, according to Haaretz, was that Hamas militants did not approach the festival from the direction of the border but from a nearby highway. In addition, the event had originally been scheduled to take place on Thursday and Friday, with Saturday added to the programme only on Tuesday that week. The report also found that most of the festival goers had managed to leave the event by the time Hamas showed up and the massacre began. “The large majority of [people who were at the event] managed to flee following the decision to disperse the event made four minutes after the rocket attack,” according to a senior police source quoted by Haaretz. The police investigation also found that an Israeli military helicopter opened fire on the assailants but also hit some people attending the festival. No further details were provided, Haaretz reported. “An investigation into the incident revealed an [Israeli military] combat helicopter that arrived at the scene from the Ramat David base fired at the terrorists and apparently also hit some of the revelers there,” the news report cited an unnamed police official as saying.

The police report also revised the death toll from the attack to 364, including 17 police officers, up from 270. It put the number of kidnapped festival-goers at 40. In response to the Hamas attacks, Israel launched aground and air assaulton the Gaza Strip that has killed more than12,000 Palestinians, including 5,000 children, according to Palestinian health authorities. Much of the Gaza Strip lies in ruins and a total blockade that Israel has imposed on the territory has left its residents unable to get enough food, water, fuel and medical supplies, all now at critically low levels.",
Fam­i­lies await freed pris­on­ers and cap­tives as West Bank raids con­tin­ue,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/25/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-officials-say-39-palestinians,"Thousands of people have gathered here. The crowds have increased throughout the evening in expectation of meeting these prisoners, greeting these prisoners and celebrating with them and their families. We have been speaking with some of the families throughout the night. As we have been reporting, many of them have been expressing great personal joy and relief at eventually being able to see their loved ones – many of whom have spent considerable time incarcerated in Israeli jails – but also mixed emotions. People here are very much aware that the war in Gaza seems nowhere near over and people of course, as you can imagine, are in great solidarity with their fellow Palestinians in Gaza. There are also concerns here about these ongoing Israeli military raids that are happening right the way across the occupied West Bank every night now. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has said she is “greatly relieved” that four German citizens are among the latest captives released by Hamas. Baerbock thanked Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Egypt and the Red Cross for helping secure their release in a post on X. “Over 200 women, children and men are still in the hands of Hamas,” Baerbock said. “Our thoughts are with their families. As much as this day gives us hope, it is not a day to rest our efforts. The release of all hostages, especially the German citizens, remains a top priority.” Baerbock said it was “crucial” that everyone honours their agreements and that the Red Cross is given access to the captives to provide them with medical care. She also said that Germany recognised the plight of the people in Gaza and that the so-called humanitarian pause to allow the delivery of food and aid must “now last as long as possible”. “Our relief supplies are ready at the Rafah border crossing,” she said. “It’s good that Israel & Egypt are now allowing for more humanitarian access.” I am greatly relieved that four German citizens are among the hostages released from#Gazatoday. I would like to thank everyone who has made this possible in recent weeks.

Emily Hand, a nine-year-old Irish-Israeli girl, is among the latest captives released by Hamas, Ireland’s prime minister has confirmed. “This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family,” Leo Varadkar said in a statement on Saturday night. “An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned, and we breathe a massive sigh of relief. Our prayers have been answered.” Irish Deputy Prime Minister Micheál Martin said the people of Ireland had been touched by “Emily’s story, her innocence and the quiet dignity and determination of her father, Tom”. Thomas Hand, who was born in Ireland before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, had initially been told that his daughter was killed in Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel before learning that she had likely been taken captive. During a press conference earlier this month, he said that his daughter’s mental and physical recovery was his “prime focus, my reason for living and getting up in the morning every day”. Emily, who spent her ninth birthday in captivity, was taken by Hamas fighters while at a sleepover at her friend’s house in Kibbutz Be’eri. Palestinian families are waiting to meet a second group of 39 Palestinian prisoners who were freed late on Saturday night. We’ll bring you more on this story soon. The Palestine Red Crescent (PRSC) is reporting that the Israeli army is besieging the Jenin Governmental Hospital and the Ibn Sina Hospital in the occupied West Bank.

"Hamas re­leas­es 13 Is­raeli, four Thai cap­tives af­ter hours-long de­lay",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/hamas-releases-thirteen-israeli-captives-after-hours-long-delay-qatar-confirms,"Israel is now expected to release 39 Palestinian prisoners from its jails under the Qatar-mediated truce. Hamas has handed over 13 Israeli captives and four Thai nationals to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) after a delay of seven hours as the group claimed that Israel had violated the terms of a truce. The impasse was resolved following mediation by Qatar and Egypt on Saturday, thesecond dayof the pause in hostilities in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel is now expected to release 39 Palestinian prisoners from its jails. Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a post on X that 13 Israelis and four foreign nationals had been handed over to the ICRC. They were on their way to the Rafah border crossing between southern Gaza and Egypt before travelling to Israel. The 17 captives had arrived in Israel, the Israeli Army posted on X. “After undergoing an initial medical assessment, they will continue to be accompanied by IDF [Israeli Army] soldiers as they make their way to Israeli hospitals, where they will be reunited with their families,” it said. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said that the 17 released were “taken to an airbase in southern Israel for an initial check where they will then be flown to several different hospitals throughout the Tel Aviv area for additional medical and psychological checks”. The Israeli captives included six adult women and seven children and teenagers, according to a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office. The hostages were released after spending 50 days in captivity, it said.

Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan had said earlier that the aid deliveries permitted by Israel had fallen short of what had been promised and were not reaching northern Gaza, which was the target of Israel’s offensive. Only 65 of 340aid trucksthat had entered Gaza since Friday had reached northern Gaza, which was “less than half of what Israel agreed on”, Hamdan said from Beirut. Israel has said 50 trucks with food, water, shelter equipment and medical supplies had deployed to northern Gaza under United Nations supervision, the first significant aid delivery there since the start of the war seven weeks ago. The Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, earlier said Israel had failed to respect the terms of thePalestinian prisonerrelease. Qadura Fares, the Palestinian commissioner for prisoners, said Israel had not released detainees by seniority, as was expected. The row over the second swap of captives for prisoners quashed hopes after 13 Israeli women and children were freed by Hamas on Friday. TenThai nationalsand one citizen from the Philippines were freed as part of a separate agreement, and 39 Palestinianwomen and teenagerswere released from Israeli jails. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the government was committed to complying with the truce agreement with Hamas but that there were many parties and factors involved. “And every day brings with it its complexities,” he added. Yet,at least two Palestinianswere reported to have been killed by the Israeli military and 11 wounded as they attempted the trip to northern Gaza on Friday. A large number of displaced people weretrying to return home across Gazaas the four-day truce brokered by Qatar took effect on Friday. However, Israel has warned people that they will not be allowed to enter the north of the war-torn enclave. Many Palestinian families were, meanwhile, waiting for the release of their loved ones from Israeli prisons. Safaa Merie, who was among hundreds of people who gathered to receive the prisoners in Beitunia, told Al Jazeera she was waiting for a 14-year-old boy on behalf of his family members from Jenin, a city in the north of the occupied West Bank. “Because of the military checkpoints by the Israelis, it’s very difficult to come here, almost impossible,” she told Al Jazeera. “I don’t know him but we are all here to welcome all the prisoners.” Manal Tamimi told Al Jazeera in el-Bireh, also in the occupied West Bank, that she was waiting for her teenage nephew Wisam to be released after seven months. “Our brothers and sisters in Gaza – our hearts are bleeding for them,” she said. “But we believe that joy is resistance too and [we should not] let the occupier break us, break our happiness.”  This is a modal window.

Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt’s State Information Service (SIS), said in a statement that Cairo was holding extensive talks with all parties to reach an agreement that would mean “the release of more detainees in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails”. Israel has said the truce could be extended if Hamas continues to release hostages at a rate of at least 10 per day. A Palestinian source has said up to 100 hostages could go free. For now, 50 of about 240 hostages are to be exchanged for 150 Palestinian prisoners over four days under the truce, the first halt in fighting since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas, raining bombs and shells on the enclave and launching a ground offensive in the north. Israel’s relentless bombardment has killed more than 14,800 people, roughly 40 percent of them children, Palestinian health authorities said on Saturday.",
Lon­don pro­test­ers at pro-Pales­tin­ian march de­mand per­ma­nent Gaza cease­fire,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/london-protesters-at-pro-palestinian-march-demand-permanent-gaza-ceasefire,"Current pause brings little respite after 15,000 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks during seven weeks of war. Central London was packed with tens of thousands of people who turned out to demand a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The National March for Palestine on Saturday took place on the second day of atruce between Israel and Hamas, which has seen the release of hostages held by the Palestinian group since October 7 and Palestinians jailed in Israel. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign estimated a turnout of 300,000 people calling for “an end to the siege of Gaza”. Protests and solidarity marches have been held inLondonandcities across the worldsince the start of the Israel-Palestine conflict seven weeks back. The Metropolitan Police said at least five people were arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred, including for distributing “literature featuring a swastika inside a Star of David”. The force said 1,500 officers were deployed to police the march.  Officers also handed out leaflets at the march “to provide clarity on offences and behaviour that won’t be tolerated”, police said. The peaceful protesters carried banners that read, “Ceasefire Now!” and “Stop the War on Gaza”. This month, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak sacked Home SecretarySuella Braverman, who drew anger for accusing police of being too lenient with pro-Palestinian protesters. She also made unauthorised comments about the country’s pro-Palestine demonstrations, which she called “hate marches”.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Tens of thou­sands ral­ly in Tel Aviv amid de­lay in re­lease of cap­tives,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/tens-of-thousands-rally-in-tel-aviv-amid-delay-in-the-release-of-captives,"Demonstration at what has become known as ‘Hostages Square’ marked 50 days since Hamas attack on Israel. An estimated 100,000 people demonstrated in Tel Aviv to call for the release of all captives held by Hamas, on the second day of atrucebetween the Palestinian group and Israel. On Saturday, friends and family of the captives and many supporters came together in trepidation in what has become known to Israelis as “Hostages Square”, near the Ministry of Defence, amid a delay in the release of the second group of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. “It certainly is the biggest number we’ve seen since this war started,” Al Jazeera’s Sara Khairat reported from Tel Aviv. “One of the factors is the release yesterday [Friday], they wanted people to come together and spread a message of hope, but also to say that they will continue with these rallies until all of the captives are brought back from Gaza,” she said, adding that there was a feeling of “cautious optimism” among the demonstrators as they waited for hours to hear news of the deal. Hamas had delayed the release of the second group of captives, accusing Israel of violating the truce, which started on Friday and is expected to last for four days. A spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs subsequently announced that “the obstacles were overcome through Qatari-Egyptian” mediation and the exchange was likely to go ahead on Saturday night, when 39 Palestinians and 13 Israeli captives would be released, in addition to seven foreigners. “People felt a lot more relieved knowing that this has now been resolved and that they will be seeing more of [the captives] released,” Khairat said. The event in Tel Aviv also marked 50 days since the October 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel, in whichabout 1,200 peopledied, according to Israeli officials.  This is a modal window.

The Israeli aerial and ground assault onGazahas since killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,000 children. On Friday, Hamas released 24 captives and Israel freed 39Palestinian women and childrenheld in its jails. “Returning hostages is the biggest mitzvah there is,” singer Ehud Banai told the crowd from the stage, The Times of Israel newspaper reported. “With Hanukkah coming, we’ll light many candles during this dark time. Our hearts are broken until we see all of them home.” Many people at the rally were wearing “Bring Them Home” campaign T-shirts, and holding placards with the names and pictures of the captives. Alon Hadar, whose grandmother Yaffa was released by Hamas on Friday, told Israeli newspaper Haaretz that “she gives us the hope that all will return, but we know we have to fight for the release of all”. “My grandmother wanted to come here tonight, but we thought, ‘too soon’ – but I’m sure she’s watching now and is proud of all of us,” Hadar said. Israelis havetaken to the streetsevery weekendin their thousandsin the last few weeks to put pressure onPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying the government was ignoring their pleas to prioritise bringing their loved ones home. Druze community leaders attending the rally on Saturday were warmly welcomed with enthusiastic applause from the crowd. Demonstrators also gathered in front of one of Netanyahu’s private residences in Jerusalem, calling for his immediate removal from office. ",
UN peace­keep­ers in Lebanon say pa­trol hit by Is­raeli fire,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/un-lebanon-peacekeepers-say-israeli-fire-hits-patrol,"United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon condemns attack as ‘deeply troubling’, no troops were injured. The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon has said that Israeli fire hit one of its patrols in the country’s south, despite atruce between Israel and Hamaslargely quietening the Lebanon-Israel frontier. “At around 12:00 pm, a UNIFIL patrol was hit by [Israeli army] gunfire” in the vicinity of Aitarun, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon said in a statement on Saturday. “No peacekeepers were injured, but the vehicle was damaged,” it said, adding that “this incident occurred during a period of relative calm” along the border between Israel and Lebanon. Since theIsrael-Palestine conflict began on October 7, thefrontier between Lebanon and Israelhas seen intensifying exchanges of fire, mainly between Israel and Shia movement Hezbollah, but also Palestinian groups, raising fears of a broader conflagration. The scope of the border fighting has gradually increased over the weeks, but it has not turned into an all-out war yet. At first, the two sides started hitting each other with artillery attacks, and Israel also brought in its drones. Afour-day trucebetween Israel and Hamas began on Friday, and a source close to Hezbollah told the AFP news agency that the Iran-backed group would also adhere to the truce if Israel did. UNIFIL said “this attack on peacekeepers, dedicated to reducing tensions and restoring stability in south Lebanon, is deeply troubling,” adding, “we condemn this act.”  Last month, shelling lightlywounded a UN peacekeepernear the border village of Hula, just hours after UNIFIL said a shell hit its headquarters in Naqura near the Israel-Lebanon border. The force said it was investigating those incidents. “We strongly remind the parties of their obligations to protect peacekeepers and avoid putting the men and women who are working to restore stability at risk,” Saturday’s UNIFIL statement said. Cross-border fire has killed 109 people in Lebanon, including 77 Hezbollah fighters and 14 civilians, three of them journalists, according to an AFP count. Six Israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed on the Israeli side, according to the authorities. Even as many Lebanese may feel for the plight of Palestinians, they alsofear getting entangled in a new conflict, many having already experienced the 2006 war in which more than 1,200 people were killed in Lebanon, many of them civilians. At least 165 Israelis were also killed. Since the pause went into effect on Friday, calm has largely returned to Lebanon’s southern border. UNIFIL was set up in 1978 to monitor the withdrawal of Israeli forces after they invaded Lebanon in reprisal for a Palestinian attack. It was bolstered after the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, and its roughly 10,000 peacekeepers are tasked with monitoring the ceasefire between the two sides.  This is a modal window.

Pales­tini­ans stock up on es­sen­tials amid surge in Gaza food prices,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/palestinians-stock-up-on-essentials-amid-surge-in-food-costs,"October saw ‘unprecedented’ spike in cost of water, wheat flour as Palestinians flock to markets on second day of truce. Food prices skyrocketed in Gaza last month, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics has said, amid Israel’s bombardment of the enclave and suffocating siege. The bureau on Saturday called the surge in October “unprecedented”, at a time when Palestinians are taking advantage of some respite in the fighting to stock up on essential items, on the second day of afour-day truce dealthat includes the release of some of the Israeli captives held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange forPalestinian prisonersin Israeli jails. Thousands of people were seen crowding around stalls and shops at the Nuseirat market in the central Gaza Strip, looking to secure much-needed food supplies. Across the Gaza Strip, people stood in long queues in order to buy wheat and other basic items. The bureau said food and beverage prices had increased by 10 percent in October, while vegetables and wheat flour saw a 32 and 65 percent rise, respectively. The price of water increased by 100 percent. Israel had suspended aid deliveries into the enclave after the conflict broke out on October 7, and restricted fuel supplies, with even bakeries rendered inactive due to the lack of wheat flour, water and fuel. The United Nations and humanitarian organisations have long warned of the “immediate possibility of starvation” and the spread of disease. The UN said that thetrucebetween Israel and Hamas has enabled it to scale up the delivery of food, water and medicine to the largest volume since the resumption of humanitarian aid convoys to Gaza on October 21. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said on Saturday it had delivered a convoy of 61 trucks carrying aid assistance to Gaza City and northern Gaza, whose residents were ordered by the Israeli military to evacuate. The UN said earlier this month that people who remained in the north were resorting to “negative coping mechanisms due to food scarcity, including skipping or reducing meals and using unsafe and unhealthy methods for making fire”. The PRCS said Saturday’s delivery was the largest since the war began. The trucks were “loaded with food and non-food items, water, primary health care medicines, and emergency medical supplies,” it said on X.  As part of the four-day deal between Hamas and Israel,137 aid trucksentered Gaza on Friday, with the pause in hostilities. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 129,000 litres (34,000 gallons) of fuel crossed into Gaza, along with four trucks carrying cooking gas for the first time since October 7. However, aid agencies say much more is needed to assist the 2.3 million people living in the besieged enclave, calling the conditions on the ground “catastrophic”. More than 1.7 million people have now been forcibly displaced across the Gaza Strip, with many sheltering in UN schools, which are experiencing severe overcrowding. According to the UN, 2.2 million people need food assistance to survive. More than 44,000 cases of diarrhoea and 70,000 cases of respiratory infections have been reported.  This is a modal window.

"Gaza’s In­done­sian Hos­pi­tal in ru­ins af­ter Is­raeli raid, days-long siege",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/gazas-indonesian-hospital-in-ruins-after-israeli-raid-days-long-siege,"Nurses recall horror of Israeli raid, interrogations, saying troops beat and humiliated them as they refused to leave patients behind. TheIndonesian Hospital, one of northern Gaza’s largest healthcare facilities, was so severely damaged in Israeli attacks that it may never open again. On Saturday, Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, told Al Jazeera, “We are in shock and horrified at the scenes left by Israeli forces at the Indonesian Hospital.” Israeli tanks and snipers had laid siege to the hospital in Beit Lahia for days, before targeting its main generator and raiding it in the early hours of Friday, shortly before afour-day trucebetween Israel and Hamas came into effect. The ministry said on Friday that the hospital was undergoing “heavy bombardment” by the Israeli army and that there was fear for the lives of 200 injured people and medical staff. It added that intense Israeli fire killed a wounded woman and injured at least three others. Now in ruins, the hospital is overwhelmed with large numbers of wounded people amid severe shortages in medical supplies. “Corridors have become wards and surgeons operate on the floor,” said Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, who gained access to the facility. “Outside the hospital building, the stench of death forces people to cover their nose, as charred and decomposing bodies, children among them, pile up in corners. No burials have taken place for days because Israeli snipers targeted anyone who ventured out to dig a grave,” he said.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Reporting from the hospital after the raid, Anas al-Sharif, one of the few remaining journalists in northern Gaza, said, “The occupation forces have damaged and destroyed large parts of the hospital. There’s been major destruction here. Even equipment and supplies have been ruined by occupation forces.” Recalling the horror of the Israeli raid and interrogation of hospital staff, a nurse told Al Jazeera, “When they stormed the hospital we told them we are nurses, civilians, and that we have children and sick people here.” “They interrogated me and three other nurses. They asked me about the resistance and if there were any fighters here. They asked about the entrances and exits of the hospital. We were all panicking. We were very scared,” she added. Another nurse recalled how Israeli forces targeted the facility’s fourth floor with a missile and cut off electricity and solar power to the buildings. “We had 25 people with broken pelvises who couldn’t be moved. They blew up this entrance, they shot the patients inside. They searched us one by one and scanned everyone’s faces. I told them I’m a nurse,” the male nurse from the emergency department told Al Jazeera. “They took me to this corner and beat me, and asked me many questions about the hospital, the Israeli captives and hostages – whether I know anything about them. Every question was accompanied by a slap. “After they left, we could’ve gone but I promised I would never leave my patients alone and that I would be the last one to leave this hospital,” said the nurse. Hundreds of displaced people had previously sought asylum at the hospital, which is also close to the Jabalia refugee camp.

Analy­sis: Lessons from Day One of truce in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/analysis-lessons-from-day-one-of-truce-in-gaza,"Everyone stopped shooting, but can emotional reunions bring new understanding between warring sides? The guns indeed fell silent exactly at 7am (05:00 GMT) on Friday. The transition from loud explosions to a sudden calm that the Gaza Strip has not seen in seven weeks was quite eerie. Right up to the top of the hour, Israeli forces appeared to be taking advantage of every last minute to keep bombing and their Hamas opponents hit back as much as they could. To everyone’s relief, both sides stopped shooting right on cue. Not a shot was heard as the fighters took a much-needed respite. All hopes now are that the pause will hold as intended and the ambitious plans for the 96 hours of uneasy truce will be carried out. A column of Israeli armoured vehicles headed towards Israel, taking soldiers home for short chance to recover. They were not being fired at, so crews stood in open hatches or allowed themselves the luxury of sitting on the vehicles’ steel bodies, basking in the morning sun, obviously trusting the pause and not showing signs of anxiety or fear. Many smiled, demonstrating clear relief, as the plan looked like it was working. Palestinian fighters also headed outdoors. Many changed into civilian clothes and rushed south to see family members and check who survived the intense bombardment and indiscriminate shelling. Reporters saw aid agencies not waste a second, the first trucks carrying much-needed supplies crossing the Rafah checkpoint from Egypt minutes after Zero Hour. One hundred crossed into the Gaza Strip on day one, and more are scheduled. The first real test, the late afternoon exchange of 13 Israeli captives held by Hamas for 39 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, 24 women and 15 teenage boys, also passed smoothly. Proving how sensitive the affair is, and fully aware of the possibility that a minor glitch could delay or even stop the planned exchanges, the two sides opted not to handle the logistics directly. Instead, they chose the safest approach, using intermediaries and, in the case of Israeli captives, going through an indirect route. Hamas first handed 13 Israeli captives to the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent (ICRC), who took them across the border into Egypt in a convoy of vehicles, handing them over to Egyptian authorities. Egyptian “possession” was very brief, as all Israelis were quickly transferred to their country’s secret service, Shin Bet, who flew them by helicopter first to a military base in the Naqab Desert (also called Negev), and then to civilian hospitals where they were reunited with their families. But this captive release procedure with all its intricacies was not Friday’s first. About half an hour before the liberation of Israeli captives, another group unexpectedly served as proof-of-concept: 10 citizens of Thailand and one Filipino were released, under the same procedures that would be used for the most anticipated group. The Thai captive deal was apparently negotiated separately, with Egypt as an intermediary. The suddenness with which it surfaced out of complete secrecy proves the nature of the complex negotiations for the release of the captives. Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners in a much simpler procedure – no go-betweens or roundabouts: the women and teenagers had first been transferred to Israel’s Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank. At the agreed time, the gates opened, and they were released to their waiting families and then on to East Jerusalem where thousands of Palestinians joined in an impromptu emotional celebration of their return to freedom. At the same time, most Israelis were anxiously watching live coverage of the return of the first batch of their compatriots. An Israeli colleague told me on Saturday that it was only when his family realised how stressed and worried they had been during the seven weeks of collective concern for the captives that they thought of the Palestinians’ anxiety for their own, held for many years. “After this, we may see them with different eyes”, he said. There was no doubt that both sides were overwhelmed by emotions and some observers hoped that the realisation of how much pain both societies are in might somehow bring them together after the war ends. But the good news of civilians being set free was marred by less-publicised news of others being killed in spite of the fighting being on pause. While the two militaries refrained from shooting at each other as agreed, the Israelis demonstrated that, in their mind, the truce extends only to the two armed sides. Israeli forces confronted hundreds of Palestinian civilians trying to return to their homes in north Gaza during the pause. They were defying Israeli orders to remain in the south, distributed in the media and air-dropped leaflets, and Israeli soldiers fired at them. Two people killed and 11 wounded by direct, aimed, assault-rifle fire is a sad reminder that, as welcome as it is now, the agreed pause has its definite limits, in duration and in scope and a warning against getting euphoric and too hopeful too soon.",

‘Noth­ing stand­ing’: Pales­tini­ans re­turn to find Gaza homes de­stroyed,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/nothing-standing-palestinians-return-to-find-gaza-homes-destroyed,"Amid the truce, some Gaza Palestinians returned to their houses in north and central Gaza – only to find rubble and debris. Some Palestinians returned to their homes in the central and northern parts of the Gaza Strip after afour-day trucecame into effect. But for many, only rubble waited where their homes once stood. Al Jazeera’s Hisham Zaqout visited the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on Saturday, where he spoke to several Palestinians who used the pause in fighting to return to their neighbourhoods – only to find utter destruction. “Our home is destroyed, nothing remains standing. And most of the ducks and chickens were eaten by hungry street dogs,” an elderly woman said. “This is not a war; it is a genocide,” she added. “It’s unprecedented crimes.” Zaqout said many residents of the Bureij camp had been forced to head to the Nuseirat refugee camp, further west, due to the constant, intense shelling by the Israeli military since last month. Upon returning, they found their homes levelled to the ground and some of the dead buried under the debris. The elderly woman said she used to “come every now and then, despite the ruthless shelling”. “It was very dangerous, but I have to come and check on my chicken livestock. I am not afraid. If I am destined to be killed, I will die. My life is not in the hands of the Zionists.” Another resident of the camp talked about the unimaginable destruction that awaited him upon his return. “Honestly, I never imagined the scale of destruction; not even 1 percent of it,” the young man said. “My home was shelled. It suffered damages and is not fit to live in any more. It must be rebuilt all over again,” he added. When asked how he could stay there again, he said he would prefer to live in a house without walls “than get humiliated in overcrowded UN schools”. “We drink seawater and pretend it is freshwater. What can we do?” Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forced to take shelter inside United Nation-run schools since the start of the war. But they have not proven safe either, and many Israeli attacks targeting them have left dozens of civilians dead. Thetruce, which runs until Monday, involves the release of dozens of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel in exchange for Israelis and other nationals held in Gaza. It may beextended, the United States and others have signalled, but Israel and its Western allies have not supported a ceasefire in the besieged strip. Another Gaza resident speaking to Al Jazeera said they “wish for eternal peace, not just four days, because people have gone through too many pains and are still suffering”. “I hope the ceasefire can last forever. Why? Because we are tired, we are tired of a life like this.” Another displaced Palestinian, a resident of Khuza’a in southern Gaza, said the scale of destruction left them shocked after returning home to the north. “The destruction is very large, tears come down alone. God suffices us and that’s all I can say.”",
Pho­tos: Aid brings re­lief in Gaza amid Is­rael-Hamas truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/25/to-make-lives-easier-aid-brings-relief-in-gaza-amid-israel-hamas-truce,"In Pictures Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are experiencing a brief period of calm after nearly 50 days of relentless bombardment by Israeli forces. The United Nations said thefour-day trucebetween Israel and Hamas, which went into effect on Friday, has enabled it to scale up the delivery of food, water and medicine to the largest volume since the resumption of humanitarian aid convoys to Gaza on October 21. The UN was also able to deliver 129,000 litres (34,078 gallons) of fuel – just over 10 percent of the daily pre-war volume – as well as cooking gas, for the first time since the war began. In Rafah in southern Gaza on Saturday, many waited to fill gas canisters for cooking. “All the people are hoping and ready for it to make their lives easier,” said one resident, Ezzeddine Abu Omeira. For the first time in over a month, aid also reached northern Gaza, the focus of Israel’s ground offensive. A UN convoy delivered flour to two facilities sheltering people displaced by the fighting. Prior to the war, 500 trucks crossed into Gaza daily, according to OCHA, the United Nations humanitarian agency. The UN estimates that 1.7 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced by the fighting which began on October 7.",
Is­rael vs Hamas: Bat­tle for nar­ra­tive su­prema­cy,https://www.aljazeera.com/program/the-listening-post/,Content loading timed out,
Is­raeli-owned ship tar­get­ed in sus­pect­ed drone at­tack: Re­ports,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/israeli-owned-ship-targeted-in-suspected-iranian-drone-attack-reports,"The vessel reportedly had its tracker turned off, a sign that crew members likely expected a threat in the region. A suspected drone attack has hit a container ship owned by an Israeli businessman in the Indian Ocean, according to a United States defence official. The attack was likely carried out using an Iranian-made Shahed-136 drone on Friday, an unnamed US defence official told The Associated Press news agency on Saturday. Pan-Arab satellite channel Al Mayadeen also reported that an Israeli ship had been targeted in the Indian Ocean. The drone targeted the Malta-flagged, French-operated CMA CGM Symi vessel while in international waters. The ship reportedly suffered damage after the drone exploded, but no crew members were injured. The US official did not provide any evidence of an Iranian link to the attack, and said “we continue to monitor the situation closely”. Iran has not commented on the reports. Maritime security company Ambrey said in the days before the attack, the ship’s tracking transmissions had stopped shortly after departing port in the United Arab Emirates. “The vessel was managed by an Israeli-affiliated company, which was assessed to be the reason why it was targeted,” Ambrey said. According to the AP, the vessel’s crew had been behaving as though they believed the ship may face a threat as they had switched off its tracking system since Tuesday, after leaving Dubai’s Jebel Ali port. The ship had done the same earlier when travelling through the Red Sea past Yemen. From Yemen, the Iran-aligned Houthis havelaunched several rounds of missile and drone attackson southern Israel since Israel declared war on Gaza last month in the wake of a Hamas attack that killed more than 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. So far, the Israeli bombardment has killed about 15,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,150 children, Palestinian officials say. Earlier this week, the Houthis alsotook control of a ship on Yemen’s Red Sea coastwhich they said was Israeli. But Israel described it as a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo vessel with no Israeli nationals on board. Iran and Israel have been engaged in a shadow war for years that has also included past claims of Iranian involvement in attacks on Israeli-owned ships. Tehran has officially denied orchestrating such attacks in the past. If the attack on the Symi vessel came late on Thursday, it would mean it happened just hours before a truce between Israel and Hamas came into effect. Israel had also ramped up its attacks on Gaza in the hours preceding the truce, according to the United Nations. Israelis and some other nationals held captive in Gaza were released on Friday in exchange for dozens of Palestinian women and children imprisoned in Israel. More exchanges are expected to take place until the end of the four-day truce on Monday, that may be extended.",
"‘Bul­let­proof’: The brief, beau­ti­ful life of Danielle Wald­man",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/25/bulletproof-the-brief-beautiful-life-of-danielle-waldman,"Danielle was just 24 when she and her partner, Noam Shay, were brutally killed by Hamas at Supernova Festival. As the daughter of Israeli tech billionaire, philanthropist and peace ambassador Eyal Waldman, 24-year-old Danielle inherited her father’s belief that Jews and Arabs could work together. He hired more than 200 Palestinian engineers at Mellanox, the tech firm he co-founded in 1999 and led until 2020, believing that working together could lead to peace. “Danielle was the same as me. She believed we must strive for peace. She worked with me as often as she could,” Eyal, who raised $360,000 for an oncology ward at a Gaza hospital in 2020, recalls. “She always thought that doing good things for other people was the best way to be. She knew many of my Palestinian friends and was friends with them, too, and she was always thinking of other people without thinking of herself. She helped so many people during her short life.” Danielle was with her boyfriend, 26-year-old Noam Shay, at the Supernova music festival which was taking place close to kibbutz Re’im near the Gaza border when it was attacked by Hamas on October 7. Some364 people were killedand 40 were taken hostage by Hamas, according to the first Israeli police report into the attack. Danielle and Noam had met six years earlier when they were both serving in the Israeli military and had been inseparable ever since. “They had just started talking about getting married,” Eyal explains. “But instead of a wedding, we held a funeral and buried them together.” Many of the hundreds of Israeli, Palestinian citizens of Israel and foreigners murdered by Hamas fighters at the Supernova music festival sent their loved ones text and voice messages saying goodbye. But Eyal didn’t even have that. “I didn’t get to say goodbye to her. She sent a text message to say she was OK at 6:30am. That was the last we heard of her. At least I have that,” he says. “I also have a video of when they were in the car before they were murdered and an audio recording from one of her friends who was wounded. But by that time, she was probably already dead.” “Danielle was amazing. She couldn’t hurt a fly and she loved everyone. Anyone who came into contact with her loved her, too,” he says. “My ex-wife [Danielle’s mother] called me the other day to tell me she had a dream about their wedding,” Eyal says, choking up with tears. Despite his unbearable loss, Eyal says he does not regret working with Palestinians and remains optimistic that the day will come when the two people will coexist in peace. He also has reason to believe the current war may turn out to be a catalyst or trigger for reconciliation: “After the [Yom Kippur] war of 1973, we started the peace process with Egypt and signed an agreement with them. There’s no reason that cannot happen again. We need to resolve this conflict. We’ve been killing each other for 75 years.” When asked about the memory of his daughter he holds most dear, he recalls a skiing holiday in France when Danielle began dancing spontaneously. “She loved to dance. She was dancing all the time,” he says. “I just posted a video from that day when she was dancing in France and my three kids joined in. It was the song, Titanium, that says ‘I’m bulletproof’. It’s the best memory I have.”",
US Pres­i­dent Biden says ‘chances are real’ for ex­tend­ing Is­rael-Gaza truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/us-president-biden-says-chances-are-real-for-extending-israel-gaza-truce,"Captives are expected to be released each day until Monday during pause in fighting. United States President Joe Biden has said there is a “real” chance that a four-day pause in Israel’s war on Gaza could be extended. “I think the chances are real,” he told reporters on Friday, while also refusing to speculate on how long the war that started on October 7 after a surprise Hamas attack inside Israel could last. “My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can,” Biden said, while reiterating his support for Israel. He stressed that “eliminating” Hamas remains a “legitimate” mission for Israel. He only said he has “encouraged” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuto try to limit civilian casualties. About 15,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed so far in Israeli bombardments following the Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel. Under the terms of the truce, which came into effect early on Friday, 50 women and children held in Gaza are to be released over four days, in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children who are among thousands imprisoned in Israeli jails. On Friday, 39 Palestinians were released in the occupied West Bankin exchange for Hamas releasing 24 captives, including 13 Israelis. More are expected to be released on Saturday afternoon. After the release of the first Hamas-held captives, Biden said: “It’s only a start, but so far it’s gone well.” Both Israel and Hamas have promised that they will continue to fight, but Israel has signalled it is open to extending the truce if more captives are released at a rate of 10 per day – something Biden said he hoped would come to pass. Hamas has said the non-civilian Israelis it is holding will only be exchanged for the thousands of Palestinians who arelanguishing in Israeli prisonsin harsh conditions, many of them held without charge. About 200 trucks with humanitarian aid also made their way into the besieged enclave as part of the truce on Friday, with the first deliveries into northern Gaza since the start of the war arriving on Saturday. But the level of destruction remains high both in the north and in the south of the Gaza Strip, and the United Nations confirmed on Friday that Israel significantly ramped up its attacks in Gaza before the truce came into effect.",
‘A place to fly’ – Jenin Free­dom The­atre stands de­fi­ant amid Is­raeli raids,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/25/a-place-to-fly-jenin-freedom-theatre-stands-defiant-amid-israeli-raids,"One of the more disturbing things that Ranin Odeh has observed during the activity sessions she runs for children at the Freedom Theatre in the West Bank’s Jenin camp is that their play often turns violent. Children frequently become overly rough and even hit each other. It is a typical trauma response, she says. “They don’t understand why they do it, but I do.” She has often seen children coping with the trauma of Israeli incursions into the camp through violent play. She doesn’t allow that kind of play in her setting, offering instead cultural and artistic activities as an alternative way to focus their fear and rage. With short, black hair and a welcoming presence, Odeh, 30, has the brightness and energy of a young person, but also the tough look of someone who has seen and lived through a great deal. Her job is particularly important to her as someone who remembers growing up during the second Intifada, or uprising. She identifies strongly with the need that children have to heal from trauma through art and play. Children need safe spaces where they can feel good, she says. “They need a place where they can fly.” Life for children in Jenin is traumatic. One day, the kids are having fun with an activity in the Freedom Theatre, says Odeh, and the next, there is an armed raid by Israeli forces on the camp – an event which has become far more frequent since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza on October 7. The Freedom Theatre itself is no stranger to danger and violence. Originally called the Stone Theatre, it was founded in 1987, after the first Intifada, by Arna Mer-Khamis, an Israeli activist who died in 1995. Mer-Khamis was born into a Jewish family in 1929 and became a lifelong supporter of the rights of Palestinians, especially children. With her theatre, she hoped to offer children a space for healing and to empower women through the theatre and arts. The first building which housed the theatre was destroyed in 2002 by Israeli forces during the second Intifada. In 2006, Juliano Mer-Khamis, Arna’s son by her Palestinian Christian husband, Saliba Khamis, reopened the theatre on a new site in Jenin, doubling as a community centre. Not everyone was in favour, however. In 2009, an unidentified person threw two Molotov cocktail bombs at the theatre while it was empty. Juliano wasshot deadby a masked attacker in Jenin in 2011 at the age of 52. His murder was never solved. Amid the latest crisis, Mustafa Sheta, the tall, broad director of the theatre, says he begins each day in the knowledge that probably nothing he has planned will actually happen. Sheta has an inviting smile, engaging intensely with you when he talks about his theatre or about Israel’s war on Gaza and frequent raids on the occupied West Bank. These days, that is nearly every time the 43-year-old speaks to visitors at the Freedom Theatre in the Jenin refugee camp, situated in the West Bank. Two weeks ago – between November 6 and 10 – multiple Israeli military incursions took place in and around Jenin. On November 9, a Thursday, Sheta and theatre staff were inside whena massive raidby Israeli forces took place from midnight until Friday dawn and resumed mid-morning. There was heavy fighting, accompanied by Israeli drone attacks. Before the big push into Jenin began on Thursday night, there had already been some attacks by Israeli forces during the day. In the evening, the electricity to the camp was cut off and Israeli forces used loudhailers to announce a two-hour window for civilians to evacuate the camp. That night, children, women and men with flashlights or the light of their mobile phones walked to the Jenin hospital, waiting for the raid to restart. During the night, many children were trapped inside schools in the camp, waiting for the incursion to end so they could be reunited with their families. Fourteen Palestinians, some of whom were fighters, were killed. Given the likelihood of armed incursions, therefore, the theatre staff begin each day trying to find out if there is going to be an attack on the camp; Sheta says he needs to know if his audience, his four children – two boys and two girls – his staff and their families will be safe. It is very difficult to organise regular programmes and he always has to have a plan B. But this is his method of resistance, he says. Indeed, “resistance through art” is the motto of the theatre. “We also struggle in the fight to free Palestine,” Sheta says. He believes there are many ways to contribute to Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation – armed struggle is just one. Sheta considers himself a “cultural fighter” but he has not escaped the effects of violence. His father, a high school teacher, was killed by Israeli troops in 2002 in Jenin just one month before Sheta graduated from college – one of his dreams for his children. Sheta has also been arrested in the past, and has spent eight months in two Israeli prisons, accused of “inciting violence”. He saw that as an opportunity to learn more about the plight of Palestinian prisoners. “The violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, particularly in Jenin, did not start on October 7,” he says. Mostly, however, he believes in the importance of preserving Palestinian culture and establishing an identity for his people which goes beyond the occupation. “It is time to invest in Palestinian culture. The struggle has to come with many steps, not only with guns.”",
"Gaza truce holds into sec­ond day, more cap­tives to be re­leased",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/gaza-truce-holds-into-second-day-more-captives-to-be-released,"Palestinians are temporarily safe from bombardment, but the UN said Gaza saw an ‘intensification’ of Israeli strikes ahead of truce. Palestinians in the war-stricken Gaza Strip are experiencing a second day of relative calm absent of Israeli attacks as a temporary pause in fighting holds. After almost 50 days of constant Israeli bombardment that has killed nearly 15,000 Palestinians in the enclave, afour-day truce came into effectfrom early Friday and appeared to be proceeding unhindered on Saturday. But the United Nations said on Friday that “the 24 hours prior to the pause witnessed an intensification of Israeli strikes from air, land and sea” throughout Gaza. The temporary truce has allowed the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza – whereno place has proven safein the past seven weeks – to experience their first night of sleep without the fear of being killed in an Israeli air raid. It also provided some time for families to try to secure supplies of food and water, which have become scarce amid the unrelenting assault on the besieged enclave. Some chose to go back to the northern parts of Gaza – which have seen the worst of the fighting between the Israeli army and Hamas – amid a ground invasion of the area by Israeli troops supported by heavy machinery and air strikes. Several Palestinians were killed on their way north as Israel ordered them to stay in the south. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said some Palestinians had a chance to visit surviving family members. “It’s also an opportunity for those who lost loved ones and friends or family members to pay them respects and offer them a prayer, as funeral processions and proper burials were not permissible under heavy bombardment and relentless air strikes,” Mahmoud said. Palestinian journalist Ismail Abu Omar on Saturday shared a video – verified by Al Jazeera – that shows a man searching for his family’s clothes from under the rubble of their Gaza home, which was destroyed in the Israeli onslaught. Palestinian photojournalist Magdi Fathi has documented the testimonies of several displaced women who say nothing is left of their homes in Khan Younis amid Israel’s bombardment of the enclave. “I came to my house to take out some things, but I did not find anything. The Israeli army destroyed the place in a way that we did not expect,” said one woman, who was among the thousands who returned to their neighbourhoods after the start of the truce yesterday. Another woman, a resident of Khuzaa in eastern Khan Younis, said she was “shocked” by what she found. “The destruction is very big,” she said. Khan Younis is one of the southern cities where residents of northern Gaza were ordered by Israel to evacuate to, but it has beenrepeatedly attackedby Israeli forces. As part of the truce,24 hostages held by Hamas in Gazawere released on Friday, 13 of whom are Israelis. More are expected to be let go, as the Israeli prime minister’s office said it had received a list of captives to be released on Saturday. Reports indicate 42 Palestinians are expected to be released in exchange for 14 captives in Gaza. Friday also saw the release of39 Palestinian women and childrenwho had been detained by Israel, some of them for years. They returned to their homes in the occupied West Bank. During the four days of the pause, at least 50 people are expected to be freed by Hamas, leaving an estimated 190 captives in Gaza. In exchange, 150 Palestinians are expected to be released by Israel. The truce, which could potentially be extended, allowed the first aid deliveries since the start of the war to arrive in northern Gaza.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Fam­i­ly cel­e­brates re­turn of freed Pales­tin­ian pris­on­er Marah Ba­keer,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/family-celebrates-return-of-free-palestinian-prisoner-marah-bakeer,"Bakeer is one of 39 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for 13 Hamas captives under a Qatar-mediated deal. Jerusalem– With tears of joy rolling down her cheeks, and a look of utter disbelief, Sawsan Bakeer ran down a flight of steps to greet her 24-year-old daughter, Marah, who had just been released after eight years in an Israeli prison. Marah Bakeer is one of 39 Palestinian women and children released from Israeli prisons on Friday in exchange for 13 Hamas captives under aQatar-mediated dealthat includes a four-day truce in Gaza. “I told you Marah is beautiful,” Sawsan told journalists, as she hugged her daughter and showered her with endless kisses. “Not because she’s my daughter, really, but Marah is beautiful, and you got to see for yourself.” Before her imprisonment, Bakeer was a 16-year-old high school student at al-Maimouna School in occupied East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood. Every day, she would make her way from the family home in Beit Hanina to school, crossing an expressway that runs between East and West Jerusalem. While on her way home on October 12, 2015, Israeli forces shot and arrested her for allegedly attempting to stab an Israeli officer. Bakeer and her family deny the accusations. When she was arrested, Bakeer was lying on the pavement with 12 gunshot wounds to her arm and hand which have left her with permanent damage. She was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison. A child when imprisoned, Bakeer was due to complete her sentence and return home in four months’ time. Newly freed, Bakeer told Al Jazeera that her time in prison was hard, but that she had endured it with her faith in God and the support of her family and fellow Palestinian prisoners. “There were many difficult times in prison, but just like anyone else going through life, they passed. “Prison was especially difficult because I was young [when I was jailed] and I needed my mother’s love and my family’s support. “Although there were many fellow prisoners who took care of me and helped me, nothing can replace a mother’s love,” she said as Sawsan held onto her. About 8,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli jails, including 3,000 who have been detained over the past seven weeks amid an increasing number of armed Israeli raids across the West Bank. Over the next four days, 150 Palestinian prisoners and 50 Israeli hostages are to be freed. Over the years of her imprisonment, Bakeer has become something of a political figure, representing all female prisoners before the administration at Damon prison in northern Israel, where female Palestinian prisoners and minors are detained. Following theHamas attack on October 7, Israel moved Bakeer, along with other prison leaders, to another prison, in Jalame, and placed her in solitary confinement. For more than six weeks, she was not permitted to communicate with her fellow inmates nor receive any information from the outside world. “It was a very difficult time because they kept me away from the rest, and it was during the war. I didn’t know what was happening to them and that really affected me,” she told Al Jazeera. “What was even harder, was that I didn’t know anything about my family. But I knew God would protect them,” she added. Bakeer was taken out of her cell on Wednesday but says she was not told what was happening. “When I didn’t go back to my cell, I knew there was a deal being negotiated, but I had no idea what the details were,” she explained. She was only informed on Friday morning that she was going to be leaving prison. Ahead of Bakeer’s release, her family said they did not have any information about when she would be coming home until Israeli forces stormed their home and asked all relatives and guests to leave. They warned against any show of joy or celebration upon Bakeer’s arrival, the family said. Bakeer’s father, Jawdat, was taken for questioning at a police station in Jerusalem and warned against the family showing any signs of joy about Marah’s release. “Marah came home to us today. We’ve just received her but they [Israeli forces] threatened to storm the house and arrest me if we celebrate,” he told Al Jazeera. Israeli forces also blocked all entry to the neighbourhood where Bakeer’s family home is located. They have stationed soldiers in front of the house, ensuring no groups can gather. Qadura Fares, who heads the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club NGO, said 33 prisoners were freed in the West Bank and handed over to a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross, while six others were released in Jerusalem. The NGO said in a statement that the Israeli government set several conditions forbidding the released prisoners and their families from speaking to the press, receiving guests at home or distributing sweets in celebration. Those who do not abide by the rules could be fined about 70,000 shekels ($18,740), the NGO added. Although Bakeer is happy to be home, she told Al Jazeera that her happiness was incomplete with the continuing bloodshed in Gaza. “I’m very happy of course, but I feel devastated by how that deal was reached … at the cost of our brothers’ and sisters’ lives in Gaza.” More than 14,800 people have been killed in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas’s attacks stands at about 1,200.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

"WHO con­cerned about al-Shi­fa chief de­tained by Is­rael, re­main­ing pa­tients",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/who-concerned-about-al-shifa-chief-detained-by-israel-remaining-patients,"Israel says the hospital director is being questioned as the WHO voices fears over the safety of dozens who are still in the facility. The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern about the fate of the head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital, Muhammad Abu Salmiya, who wasdetained by Israelthis week. The WHO said in a statement on Friday that the director of the biggest hospital in the besieged Palestinian territory had been arrested on Wednesday along with five other health workers, while they were taking part in a United Nations mission to evacuate patients. “Three medical personnel from the Palestine Red Crescent Society and three from the Ministry of Health were detained,” the WHO said. Since then, two of the six have reportedly been released, but “we do not have information about the well-being of the four remaining health staff, including the director of Al-Shifa hospital,” the statement added. The UN agency called for “their legal and human rights to be fully observed during their detention”. A spokesperson for the Israeli army said on Saturday that Abu Salmiya was being questioned. “We are currently moving forward with … questioning him over the fact that he was the head of a hospital that was really sitting on top of an entire terror network,” Israeli military spokesperson Doron Spielman said. “How could he not know what’s happening? We have hostages that were on, you know, CCTV in his hospital.” The Israeli army, which raided the hospital last week, hasallegedthat Hamas fighters used a tunnel complex beneath al-Shifa as a command centre – an assertion Hamas and hospital officials have repeatedly denied.

Abu Salmiya has frequently been quoted by international media about the conditions inside al-Shifa, a major focus of theIsraeli air raids and ground offensivefollowing attacks by Hamas fighters on October 7. A week ago, the Israeli army ordered anevacuationof al-Shifa, which had housed 7,000 people including patients and displaced Palestinians. But dozens of patients who could not be moved remained inside with a handful of medics. The WHO has carried out three evacuation missions to the hospital in the space of a week, the organisation said, on one occasion managing to transfer 31 babies from the hospital. During the third mission on Wednesday, which was carried out in cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent, 151 people were evacuated, including patients, their relatives and healthcare workers, according to the WHO. A WHO spokesperson said on Friday that the UN agency was working on further evacuations from northern Gaza hospitals as soon as possible as a truce gets under way, voicing fears for the safety of those remaining in al-Shifa Hospital. “We’re extremely concerned about the safety of the estimated 100 patients and health workers remaining at al-Shifa,” said WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier. He declined to react to comments from the Gaza health ministry saying it was suspending cooperation with the global health agency amid reports that Israel is holding medical staff for questioning.

Here’s a recap of Saturday’s key events: The Palestinian Red Crescent says one of its ambulances in the occupied West Bank was “targeted” near Ofer Prison. The attack “resulted in the rear window shattering, and our team is safe”, the PCRS said in a post on X. Dozens of Palestinians gathered outside the vicinity of Ofer awaiting the imminent release of the second round of Palestinian prisoners. The Israeli government has said six adult women and seven children and teenagers have been released by Hamas. The hostages were released after spending 50 days in captivity, a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office said. The Israeli military said the hostages have returned to Israeli territory. Army spokesman Hagari says 13 Israeli captives and four Thai nationals are with the Red Cross and on their way to the border crossing known as Kerem Shalom, or Karam Abu Salem.

Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, says in a post on X that 13 Israelis and four foreign nationals have been handed over to the Red Cross. Al Ansari said they were on their way to the Rafah border crossing. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said the Israeli military confirmed “just moments ago” that Hamas handed over the captives to the Red Cross. “They will then be handed over to the Israeli military. They will be taken to an airbase in southern Israel for an initial check, where they will then be flown to several different hospitals throughout the Tel Aviv area for additional medical and psychological checks,” she added. Hamas’s armed wing says it handed over 13 Israeli captives and seven foreign nationals to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The ICRC is expected to take them through the Rafah border crossing between southern Gaza and Egypt before travelling to Israel. The Palestinian Red Crescent (PRCS) says the whereabouts of Awni Khattab, the head of the Khan Younis Medical Centre, are “now unknown”. Israeli forces arrested Khattab on Thursday, along with three paramedics and a companion of a wounded person who were later released. They were involved in the evacuation of wounded and sick people from al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City – which remains occupied by Israeli forces – to the enclave’s south. “PRCS demand his immediate release along with other medical teams that are under arrest,” it said. Ammar Khalid Massarweh, whose grandson was taken seven months ago after he was injured by Israeli soldiers, says Palestinians had to pay a very high price for the release of their compatriots. “It was paid with the blood of our people in Gaza,” said Massarweh, an ambulance driver. “This is an incomplete joy that we are feeling right now.” “I hope that all the prisons will be empty and all our sons will be freed,” he told Al Jazeera. Is now really the best time to restart discussions about the elusive two-state solution for Israel and Palestine? International calls have begun to grow louder to pursue this.

In a statement on Friday, prosecutors said that police detained Atal, who plays for French club Nice, for questioning on Thursday as part of a probe into possible “justification of terrorism” over the post. He was released on bail of 80,000 euros ($87,500) on Friday, and placed under judicial supervision pending the trial. He is not allowed to leave France except for international games.

The Nice defender is one of several footballers who have faced criticism or penalties for social media posts amid theescalating fightingbetween Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas that has created simmering tensions in communities around the world. After French football starKarim Benzemacriticised “unjust bombings which spare no women or children” in a social media post about Israel’s assault on Gaza, which Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 6,500 children, France’s Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin accused him — without evidence — of having links to the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood. A French senator also called on Benzema to be stripped of previous football awards as well as his French citizenship. On Thursday, a council member of the Football Association (FA), English football’s governing body, resigned after comparing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. “Recent events have left me bereft of energy and hope. I have felt overwhelmed at how this has transpired,” Wasim Haq said in a resignation letter posted to social media, in which he said that he had meant to criticise a politician and not Jewish people more widely.

"Hamas frees 10 Thai cit­i­zens, one Fil­ipino un­der sep­a­rate deal: Qatar",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/12-thai-one-filipino-captive-released-in-separate-deal-mediated-by-qatar,"Their release was outside of truce between Israel and Hamas, in which 13 Israelis were freed for 39 Palestinians. Hamas has released a group of 10 Thai nationals and one citizen from the Philippines who were being held in Gaza, as part of a separate agreement to the one between Israel and the Palestinian group that saw Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners being freed. Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson of the foreign ministry in Qatar – which has played a key mediating role – said on Friday that the Thai nationals and Filipino were among a total of24 captives who were released. The Thai nationals, he said, were “currently on their way out of the strip” with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They were not covered by thetruce dealbetween Hamas and Israel, and Qatar and Egypt mediated a separate deal with Hamas, Thai officials said. That negotiation track was opened when Thailand’s foreign minister visited Qatar on October 31, which led to a specific agreement with Hamas to release the Thais, the officials added. Thai nationals were the single biggest group of foreigners taken captive. But Thailand’s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin posted earlier on X that he had received confirmation of the release of 12 nationals and that Thai embassy officials were to pick them up. The group was brought to Rafah and then to the Karem Abu Salem crossing, called Kerem Shalom by Israel, east of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. They were transported to a processing point at the Hatzerim Air Force base and were to be taken to the Shamir Medical Centre, southeast of Tel Aviv. “At this time, the gender and names of these Thais are not known,” the ministry statement said.

Apart from Qatar and Egypt, the ministry also thanked Israel, Iran, Malaysia and the ICRC. Iran and Thailand maintain friendly relations and prominent members of Thailand’s Muslim minority made unofficial trips to Tehran to seek the captives’ freedom, The Associated Press news agency reported. Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara had said that his Iranian counterpart, who was serving as Thailand’s intermediary with Hamas, had told him there would be “good news soon”, the report said. At least 23 Thai workers are believed to be among the estimated 240 people who were taken captive by Hamas during the October 7 attack. An additional 32 Thai workers were killed in the attack in southern Israel. According to the Thai ministry, some 30,000 Thais were employed mainly in Israel’s agricultural sector at the time of the attack. More than 8,600 Thai workers have been voluntarily repatriated since then. Under an agreement with Israel, Thai workers are paid a minimum wage of 5,300 shekels a month ($2,000), six or seven times more than they earn at home. Qatar has led weeks of intense negotiations, coordinating with the United States and Egypt, to reach an agreement for the freeing of 50 civilian hostages from Gaza in return for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a brief truce and access to humanitarian aid. Thirteen Israelis, including dual nationals, were released by Hamas on Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged that thecaptive release dealwould not spell the end of the war, saying Israel would continue its push to “eliminate” Hamas. Benny Gantz, a part of Israel’s war cabinet, reiterated at a solidarity rally for the families of captives in Tel Aviv that the army will resume fighting after the humanitarian pause. “I want to assure the families of all the hostages: We will not stop. We will resume the efforts and the military action in Gaza to retrieve the hostages and restore deterrence,” Gantz said. In his first statement since the Israeli captives were released, Netanyahu said that their return was “one of the aims of the war and we are committed to achieving all the aims of the war”.",
Who are the Pales­tin­ian pris­on­ers Is­rael re­leased on Fri­day?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/who-were-the-palestinian-prisoners-israel-released-on-friday,"Thirty-nine Palestinian women and children are expected to be released from Israeli jails on Friday during a pause in fighting. After seven weeks of war, thefour-day trucebetween Israel and Hamas began on Friday morning. Under this truce,39 Palestinianwomen and children were released on Friday. Here is what’s known about those released and those who might be released in the coming days. Of the 39 Palestinians released by Israel, 17 are minors. They are: Zeina and Noor are girls, the others are boys. The remaining 22 of the Palestinians released on Friday are women. They are: They were transferred from Israeli prisons to the Israel-controlled Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank in the early evening. At 8pm local time (18:00 GMT),they were releasedfrom Ofer in International Committee of the Red Cross buses. Israel has agreed to release 150 Palestinian women and children prisoners from its jails in exchange for Hamas releasing 50 of the women and children taken captive during theOctober 7 attack. But the Israeli Ministry of Justice presented a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners who it is considering for release. It is unclear whether this might be an offer for a potential second phase of exchanges since the dealallows forthe extension of a pause in fighting by one day for every 10 additional captives Hamas releases. The list of 300 comprises 33 women. The majority of the rest of the names are of boys aged 16-18. However, there are also boys as young as 14 on the list. Most of the prisoners on the list were arrested between 2021 and 2023. The prisoners arrested in 2023 were taken before October 7. However, it also includes individuals likeShorouq Dwayyat, who was arrested in 2015 and is serving the ninth year of her 16-year sentence. Dwayyat is currently serving the longest sentence among Palestinian female prisoners in Israeli jails. She was 18 when she was arrested and held in the Damon prison in Haifa, accused of stabbing an Israeli settler with a knife. Her family, anxiously anticipating her release, denies these accusations. “Shorouq is delicate and cannot harm an animal,” her father, Salah Dwayyat,toldAl Jazeera at the time. Like Dwayyat, many other prisoners have been convicted of crimes including carrying and manufacturing knives and daggers. Other common offences detailed in Israel’s list include: “The main alleged crime for these detentions is stone-throwing, which can carry a 20-year sentence in prison for Palestinian children,”saida report published in July by children’s rights organisation, Save the Children. Israeli publication Haaretz reported that Israel has refused to release people convicted of murder but those convicted of attempted murder could be released. Under the deal, Palestinian prisoners will be taken fromtwo Israeli prisonssoutheast of Haifa, namely Damon and Megiddo. They will then be taken to Israel’s military Ofer prison. There, they will be handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross and after they are received, “the ones from Jerusalem will go to Jerusalem, and the ones from the West Bank will gather in Betunia municipal council where their families will be waiting”, added Fares. Israel has barred celebrations in Palestinian communities over the return of prisoners. There are19 prisonswithin Israel and one inside the occupied West Bank holding Palestinian prisoners. Before October 7, there were about 5,200 Palestinians in Israeli custody. However, following the Hamas attack of October 7, the number of Palestinians arrested skyrocketed and 3,000 more were arrested. Of those arrested after October 7, 37 are journalists. Palestinian prisoner support and human rights association Addameer reported that most of these journalists were subjected to administrative detention, which means they are held indefinitely behind bars without facing trial or charges. Addameer also reported that the detainees are subjected to physical violence and medical negligence in prisons. The report cited an example of a prisoner who suffers from blood disease and asthma. The prisoner was assaulted, resulting in wounds and bruises on his head and eyes. The association reported that this prisoner has lost 10kg since his arrest. Some Palestinian prisoners have been in Israeli jails for more than 30 years, since before theOslo Accordswere signed. The term “deans of prisoners” is sometimes locally used to refer to them, reported Samidoun, an international Palestinian prisoner solidarity network. At least 700 Palestinian children under the age of 18 from the occupied West Bank are prosecuted every year through Israeli military courts after being arrested, interrogated and detained by the Israeli army. Children in Israeli detention often suffer physical, psychological and sexual abuse, and some are deprived of food, water and sleep, according to Save the Children.  This is a modal window.

Hamas re­leas­es 24 hostages from Gaza on first day of Is­rael truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/hamas-releases-24-hostages-from-gaza-after-truce-comes-into-effect,"Israel releases 39 Palestinian prisoners in exchange as part of deal that includes a four-day truce in Gaza. The Palestinian armed group Hamas has released24 hostagesheld captive in Gaza for almost seven weeks and Israel has released 39 Palestinian prisoners, hours after an Israel-Hamas truce mediated by Qatar came into effect. Among the captives released were 13 Israelis, 10 Thai nationals, and one Filipino citizen, Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry in Qatar, said on Friday. The ICRC in Israel and the occupied territories said that it transported the group of captives from Gaza to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. “We are relieved to confirm the safe release of 24 hostages,” the ICRC wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The release of the 24 captives — out of the roughly 240 taken hostage by Hamas during an assault on southern Israel on October 7 — comes after a deal betweenIsrael and Hamas, which includes a four-day truce and exchange of captives for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, took effect. The Israeli captaives were back in Israeli territory where they would undergo medical checks before being reunited with their families, the army said. They included four children and six elderly women, a list issued by the Israeli prime minister’s office showed. “Our citizens underwent an initial medical examination and their families were informed by the appointed officials that they were back,” it said in a statement. In a video recording, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his government is committed to the return of all remaining captives. Qatar said 39 Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli jails were released as part of the deal. Israel confirmed 39 prisoners had been released. Qadura Fares, who heads the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club NGO, said 33 prisoners freed in the West Bank were handed to a team from the ICRC. He said the remaining six were being released from a Jerusalem prison. Israeli forces fired tear gas at a crowd of Palestinians who had gathered for the release of the prisoners outside Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank.  This is a modal window.

According to the deal mediated by Qatar, Hamas will release 50 women and children, from about 240 peopletaken captiveby the group during its assault on southern Israel on October 7. In exchange, Israel will release a total of 150 Palestinian women and children held inIsraeli prisons, whom Palestinians have long characterised as victims of an Israeli occupation that sweeps them into prisons with little pretence of due process. The captives taken by Hamas on October 7 include Israeli soldiers and civilians, as well as people from dozens of foreign countries. In both Israel and abroad, the families of those held captivehave pleadedfor their release. Qatar’s al-Ansari said that the 10 Thai nationals and Filipino citizen were freed outside the framework of the truce deal. Earlier on Friday, Thailand’s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said 12 Thai nationals help in Gaza had been released. “It has been confirmed by the security side and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that 12 Thai hostages are already released,” he posted on X. According to Thailand’s foreign ministry, about 30,000 Thais were employed in Israel, primarily in the country’s agricultural sector, at the time of the attack, in which at least 32 Thai workers were killed. Thais seeking work overseas often come to Israel under an arrangement in which they are paid minimum wage of about $2,000 a month.",
Hamas re­leas­es 24 cap­tives amid Is­rael truce: Here’s what’s to know,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/hamas-releases-25-captives-amid-israel-truce-heres-whats-to-know,"The 24 freed include 13 Israelis, 10 Thai nationals and one Filipino, who were released via the Egypt border. After weeks of negotiations, Hamas on Friday released the first batch of captives it had agreed to set free under atruce dealwith Israel that came into effect in the morning. Fighters took 237 people into captivity from Israel after Hamas’s October 7 attack. Under the deal for a four-day truce, Hamas is to release 50 captivesin exchangefor the release of 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel and a pause in fighting. However, more than those numbers might be released, officials indicated. The deal was reached, and announcedby Qatar, on Wednesday, while the truceofficially startedat 7:00am local time (5:00 GMT) on Friday. Here is what we know about the captives released by Hamas and those who are still in Gaza. In all, 24 captives were freed by Hamas on Friday. While initially, the plan was for Hamas to release 13 Israeli captives — women and children — it eventually freed 24 people, including 10 Thai nationals. The prime minister of Thailand announced the release of 12 Thai citizens on X.  But later in the evening, the foreign ministry of Qatar — which has led the negotiations that have culminated in the truce and exchange of captives and prisoners — said the composition of the freed captives was: All 24 captives were transferred by Hamas to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who crossed them over from Gaza into Egypt through the Rafah crossing. The captives were handed over to Egyptian authorities. The first release reports suggest Thai captives were freed just before 4:00pm local time (14:00 GMT). About half an hour later, the other captives were released, Hamas officials told AFP. On the Egyptian side of the border, the freed Israeli captives met representatives of the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, according to the Israel Broadcasting Authority. Medical staff, soldiers and helicopters were also waiting for them. The released captives were taken in helicopters to hospitals in Tel Aviv for medical and psychological assessments. At the hospitals, captives will also reunite with their families, the Israeli army said earlier on Friday. The Thai captives who were freed on Friday are among 23 who were captured by Palestinian fighters during their attack on southern Israel on October 7. Late on Friday, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office released the names of the 13 Israelis freed by Hamas. They include four children and several elderly people, among others.    However, relatives of the first group have not commented on the release. The Israeli government has reportedly warned them to not speak with the media and asked news outlets to not publish names accessed through any leaks. The captives who were originally to be released today are among the 50 that Hamas has committed to freeing over four days under the truce agreement. But with the 10 Thai captives and one Filipino also being released, the total number of those whom Hamas frees during the truce is expected to exceed 50. Three US citizens and eight French citizens are among those who could be freed during the truce, according to officials from the two countries. The three American captives include two women and a three-year-old girl whose parents were killed in the initial Hamas attack. It is unclear if any of the American or French captives were among those released on Friday. Ghazi Hamad, member of Hamas’s political bureau, told Al Jazeera that they are focused on releasing civilians for now. Hamad added that a comprehensive release of captives, including Israeli soldiers, would require an exchange with all 7,200 Palestinians who are imprisoned. Palestinian fighters took 237 people into captivity during itsOperation Al-Aqsa Flood, according to Israel, although not all of them are currently with Hamas. Other resistance groups in the Gaza Strip, such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, are also holding some captives. The finalisation of the truce deal involved the agreement of all resistance brigades via phone call, said Hamas prior to the deal’s announcement. Hamas fighters abducted the captives during raids on an outdoor music festival, collective farms called kibbutzim, and military bases in Israel onOctober 7. Not all captives are Israeli. At least half are foreign and dual nationals hailing from approximately 40 countries including the US, Thailand, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, Germany, Chile, Spain and Portugal, according to the Israeli government. At least 33 captives are children, including preschoolers and a 10-month-old baby, according to Israel. They have also reported that others in the group include soldiers, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Hamas has said that the captives are housed in “safe places and tunnels”. Freed captives have reported sleeping on mattresses on floors of tunnels and being provided medical care. Hamas has previously released four captives that were being held in Gaza. Thefirst pairof captives freed was an American mother-daughter duo on October 20, following Qatari meditation. Three days later, twoelderly womenwere returned to Israel on “humanitarian reasons and poor health grounds”, following mediation led by Egypt and Qatar. Israel’s military has said that itrescued one abducted soldier,Ori Megidish, andfound the bodyof another near al-Shifa Hospital. Hamas has said that Israeli air attacks have killed 50 captives in Gaza, including their army conscript, Noa Marciano, near the hospital. On November 16, Israel’s military also said it recovered the body of acivilian captive,Yehudit Weiss, near al-Shifa. On Tuesday, the PIJ said one elderly woman, Hanna Katzir, died in captivity owing to Israel “stalling” her release after the group offered to return her for humanitarian reasons. Israel has not responded to these claims.",
Egypt’s el-Sisi says fu­ture Pales­tin­ian state could be ‘de­mil­i­tarised’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/egypts-el-sisi-says-future-palestinian-state-could-be-demilitarised,"El-Sisi spoke after a meeting with the Spanish and Belgian PMs as they try to shore up support for a peace conference. A future Palestinian state could be demilitarised and have a temporary international security presence, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has said. “We said that we are ready for this state to be demilitarised, and there can also be guarantees of forces, whether NATO forces, United Nations forces, or Arab or American forces, until we achieve security for both states, the nascent Palestinian state and the Israeli state,” el-Sisi said on Friday during a joint news conference in Cairo with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo. A political resolution which calls for a Palestinian state based on the June 4, 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, has remained out of reach, el-Sisi added. Arab nations have rejected suggestions that an Arab force could provide security in the Gaza Strip after the end of Israel’s current military operation there against the Palestinian group Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told reporters in London this week that Arab states would not want to go into a Gaza Strip that could be turned into a “wasteland” by Israel’s military offensive. “What are the circumstances under which any of us would want to go and be seen as the enemy and be seen as having come to clean up Israel’s mess?” he said. Shoring up support for an international peace conference The Spanish prime minister, whose new government was sworn in earlier this month, is visiting the region alongside his Belgian counterpart. Their two countries hold the current and upcoming rotating presidencies of the Council of the European Union, respectively. Sanchez has been trying toshore upmomentum for an international peace conference aimed at securing the establishment of a “viable” Palestinian state, he told Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. Last week, Sanchez said a Union for the Mediterranean summit in Barcelona on November 27-28 would be an “ideal place” to relaunch Israeli-Palestinian dialogue as the two sides would “sit on an equal footing” there. Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs limited parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, are members of the Mediterranean grouping along with neighbours Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. Later on Friday, Sanchez and de Croo visited the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, currently the only one providing access to the besieged enclave. De Croo called on Israel to open more of Gaza’s crossings “because innocent civilians are suffering and they need help.” Sanchez said during the visit to Rafah that the currentfour-day trucein Gaza is not enough and that a permanent ceasefire was needed. Combat between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters halted on Friday for the first time in seven weeks before the planned release of civilian hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The fighting erupted on October 7 when Hamas carried out an attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. Israel has responded with a devastating assault on Gaza, killing more than 15,000 people, including more than 6,000 children, according to Palestinian authorities.  This is a modal window.

"Amid Gaza war, ac­tivists in Ar­genti­na aim to ex­pel Is­raeli wa­ter com­pa­ny",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/amid-gaza-war-activists-in-argentina-aim-to-expel-israeli-water-company,"Protesters have denounced the state-owned Israeli company Mekorot for its human rights record as it expands in Argentina. Buenos Aires, Argentina –The upscale neighbourhood of Recoleta was pulsing with the sound of drums and chanting last month, as protesters gathered outside the Palestinian embassy in Buenos Aires to call for an end to Israel’s war in Gaza. But amid the sea of Palestinian flags, Silvia Ferreyra gripped a different symbol of solidarity. Above her head, she held a banner depicting a blue ribbon of water trapped behind a lock and chain. Printed above the picture in large red type was the phrase, “Fuera Mekorot”. Ferreyra, 52, had a simple message. She wantedMekorot, Israel’s state-run water company, out of Argentina. Since September 2022, seven Argentinian provinces have signed wide-ranging agreements granting Mekorot significant influence over how they allocate water resources. Yet, with Israel drawing outcry for its deadly military campaign in Gaza, Argentinian activists are looking to leverage the public attention to pressure the government into cutting ties with the company. “We are trying to [spread] the information that this is not only something completely foreign to our country, but that in our country there is a business … causing conflict in Palestine,” said Ferreyra, a longtime organiser who works in the Argentinian Chamber of Deputies’s environmental commission. Mekorot’s future in Argentina cannot be evaluated “without taking into account the current situation and the context of the conflict there in the Gaza Strip”, she added. “We have to discuss the origins of this conflict more deeply.” Though widely seen as a world leader in water management technology, Mekorot has drawninternational condemnationfor its policies in Gaza and the West Bank. It hascontrolled water suppliesin the two Palestinian territories since Israel occupied them in 1967. Though not directly named, the company’s activities were referenced in a2022 reportby United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights Michael Lynk, which accused Israel of implementinga system of “apartheid”against Palestinians. The report identified access to water as a major source of inequality. “The utilities and services which the [Israeli] settlements enjoy — water, power, housing, access to well-paid jobs, roads and industrial investment — are far superior to those available to the Palestinians,” it explained. The Israeli nonprofit B’Tselem also blamed “Israel’s deliberately discriminatory” policies forwater shortagesin the West Bank. In anApril report, B’Tselem found that only 36 percent of Palestinians in the area had running water throughout the year. There were also wide discrepancies in water usage. Israeli settlers in the West Bank consumed an average of 247 litres (65 gallons) of water per capita each day, while Palestinians used just 82.4 (21 gallons) — limiting their ability to meet their basic needs for hydration, hygiene, sanitation and everyday chores. “To make up for the shortage, the Palestinian Authority is forced to purchase water from Israel’s national water company, Mekorot, at a much higher cost,” the report explained. When Israel began its military campaign last month, it used Mekorot to cut the water supply to Gaza completely, forcing residents to drink polluted water. Hospitals, meanwhile, were left without proper sanitation. “Israel is using its strategic control over water resources on the one hand, and water distribution on the other, as a geopolitical tool and does so in highly unequal ways,” said Erik Swyngedouw, a geographer at the University of Manchester who researches the intersection of water and politics. Mekorot did not respond to a request for comment about its humanitarian record in Gaza and the West Bank, nor about concerns over its expansion in Argentina. The accusations that Mekorothas contributedto the oppression of Palestinians have prompted some groups to sever ties with the Israeli water company over the past decade. In the Netherlands, the water company Vitens announced in 2013 that it would end relations with Mekorot after consulting with the Dutch foreign ministry. The next year, in Portugal, EPAL — the company that provides water to the city of Lisbon — likewise ended a technology exchange deal over Mekorot’s actions in the Palestinian territories. And in 2014, the Argentinian province of Buenos Aires scrapped a deal with the company to build a desalination plant after public protests. However, Mekorot continues to enjoy partnerships around the world. Its projects range from a water system in Mexico to a desalination plant in Morocco. Further support comes from Argentinian governmental institutions, including the Ministry of the Interior. In February, Interior Minister Eduardo de Pedro led the country’s national water authority and a public-private investment body in signing agreements to transfer control over water administration in multiple provinces to Mekorot. With the world’s sixth-largest Jewish population, Argentina has traditionally been an ally of Israel, and the countries maintain strong bilateral relations through institutions like the Argentine-Israeli Chamber of Commerce. As Argentina faces a historic drought, government officials have praised Mekorot for its efficiency and technological prowess, with Interior Minister de Pedro saying that Israel offers an “example” for “managing a resource as scarce as water”. Yet organisers of “Fuera Mekorot” — the movement to expel Mekorot from Argentina — are concerned about the impact the company might have on the country. Marta Maffei, a former deputy in the National Congress, is among those who oppose Mekorot’s expansion in Argentina. She has advocated for a law to protect water access as a basic human right. “Why should a state enterprise that manages water as a form of social control come to Argentina?” Maffei said. “In our territories, there are also Indigenous peoples, there are poor peasant communities, who demand their water.” Maffei’s home province of Rio Negro signed an agreement with Mekorot in February to transfer a number of responsibilities to the company, including calculating the “economic value” of water and drafting a proposal for an authority to regulate drinking water and sanitation services. The area is already a hotspot for fracking, an industry that uses large amounts of water to extract oil and natural gas, and clashes have erupted between local groups and police over water access. Mekorot’s representatives have indicated they would approach water as a commodity to finance future growth, a prospect that has alarmed some advocates. “The water bill has to cover all costs plus the costs of future investment,” Diego Berger, Mekorot’s international coordinator for special projects, said in a March interview with the YouTube channel Alterrados. The commodification of water resources, however, comes with risks, according to Swyngedouw, the Manchester University geographer. It could have “profound negative social [and] ecological consequences for small peasants, Indigenous people and others who depend on water access for their livelihoods”, he said. A business-based approach to water access also threatens to conflict with traditional Indigenous views. “From the Western perspective, [water] is called a ‘resource’,” said Miriam Liempe, the Indigenous relations secretary for the Argentine Workers’ Central Union and a member of the Fuera Mekorot coalition. “However, [Indigenous] peoples call it a brother, like something that has life — like the trees, like the birds.” A member of theMapuche people, Liempe said what worries her most about Mekorot is what she calls the company’s failure to consult Indigenous groups when planning water management projects. If projects like diverting rivers lead to thedisplacementofIndigenous groups, Liempe said they could violate international law. According to the International Labor Organization’s 1989 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, Indigenous peoples “shall not be removed from the lands which they occupy”, and any attempt at relocation requires “free and informed consent” from the groups involved. As Mekorot continues to make advances in Argentina, Ferreyra said her organisation’s biggest obstacle has been a general lack of awareness among Argentinian people. After the war in Gaza broke out, she and other activists held a series of events about Mekorot’s activities in Argentina. “We have been in a process of trying to establish an awareness of what Mekorot is,” Ferreyra said. “It’s not a very well-known company.” Hasan Najjar, an Argentinian who was born in Gaza, said he only found out about Mekorot’s presence in Argentina when he attended a protest where Fuera Mekorot organisers were present. But the company’s actions did not surprise him. “They have experience against Indigenous people, in killing us slowly, like with food and water or with bombs,” Najjar said. Silvia Muñoz, who works at a food kitchen in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, said she heard about Mekorot for the first time at a panel discussion in the city’s historic San Telmo neighbourhood. “It’s a business for them, but a mafia business,” Muñoz said. “It makes me concerned.” Ferreyra believes she has made progress in raising awareness of Mekorot’s presence in Argentina. But she has no illusions that blocking the company’s business ambitions will be easy. “We know that this is not something simple, because we understand the involvement and weight that Israel has in a lot of aspects that make up the economic life of our country,” Ferreyra said. “We still have a lot to do.”",
Pales­tini­ans re­turn to de­stroyed homes in Gaza as Is­rael-Hamas truce be­gins,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/24/palestinians-return-to-destroyed-homes-in-gaza-as-israel-hamas-truce-begins,"In Pictures With children and pets in their arms and their belongings loaded onto donkey carts or car roofs, thousands of displaced Gaza Palestinians have set off for home as a four-day Israel-Hamas truce began. The din of war was replaced on Friday by the horns of traffic jams and sirens of ambulances making their way through crowds emerging from hospitals and schools where they had taken refuge. For nearly seven weeks, Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip had been relentless. Some 1.7 million of the territory’s 2.4 million people are estimated to have been displaced, and more than half of homes damaged or destroyed, the United Nations says. But on Friday morning, no shots were heard in Khan Younis, in the south of the Palestinian territory. Crowds of men, women and children travelled on foot, carts or tuk-tuks with the few belongings they had taken with them when the war started. Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air raids, and the territory faces shortages of food, water and fuel. Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets warning people in the south not to head back to the north, where it had previously told Palestinians to leave for their safety. “The war is not over yet,” they read. “Returning to the north is forbidden and very dangerous!!!”",
UN agen­cies hope truce will al­low aid into north­ern Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/un-agencies-hope-truce-will-allow-aid-in-gaza,"While welcoming pause in hostilities and entry of supplies, UN health agency chief says ‘much more is needed’. United Nations agencies have welcomed the entry of aid trucks into the Gaza Strip from Egypt after atrucegot under way between Israel and Hamas but said more needs to be done to deal with the massive humanitarian crisis in the enclave after seven weeks of war. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was working on more evacuations from hospitals, which have been repeatedly attacked by Israeli forces. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the entry of aid into Gaza was a “step in the right direction” but “much more is needed”. “We continue to call for a sustainable ceasefire to end further civilian suffering,” he posted on X.  Aid agencies have said they are aiming to deliver supplies to northern Gaza, where hospitals havecollapsedbecause ofIsraeli bombingand the lack of fuel and where there are major concerns about dehydration and disease outbreaks. Aid deliveries are so far only being allowed through Rafah, Gaza’s one border crossing with Egypt in the southern part of the enclave, and not through its crossings with Israel. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that on the first day of the pause, 200 trucks were dispatched from Nitsana to the Rafah crossing, while 137 trucks of goods were offloaded by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) reception point in Gaza making it the biggest humanitarian convoy received since October 7.  It also said that 129,000 litres (34,000 gallons) of fuel and four trucks of gas crossed into Gaza, adding that 21 critical patients were evacuated in a large-scale medical operation from the north of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people were assisted with food, water, medical supplies and other essential humanitarian items, OCHA said in its update. Asked earlier whether the UN had guarantees from Israel that it could deliver aid to the north, OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke said: “We proceed on the basis of the hope and the expectation that we will reach people in need where they are.”  Before the conflict started in October, nearly 10,000 truckloads of commercial and humanitarian commodities, excluding fuel, entered Gaza monthly, according to the UN. On Friday, OCHA said in a statement that 80 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies entered from Egypt on the previous day. Gaza resident Ashraf Shann told Al Jazeera that people were happy that “some sort of aid is coming” into the enclave. “My family is made up of 12 people, and we are internally displaced persons. This is the first time this has happened to us,” he said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said it received two ambulances and 85 aid trucks loaded with humanitarian aid, including food, water, medical supplies and medicines. While about 200 aid trucks are expected to enter Gaza during the four-day humanitarian pause, PRCS spokesperson Nebal Farsakh told Al Jazeera that it was a “drop in the ocean”. “The situation has gone beyond catastrophic at a humanitarian level and a medical level … The complete health sector now is collapsing during this ongoing escalation,” Farsakh said.  WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said the agency was working on further hospital evacuations as soon as possible. “We’re extremely concerned about the safety of the estimated 100 patients and health workers remaining at al-Shifa”, referring to the largest medical complex in Gaza, which was a major focus of Israel’s ground offensive. Lindmeier declined to react to comments from Gaza’s Ministry of Health that it was suspending cooperation with the global health agency amid reports that Israel was holding medical staff for questioning. Tommaso Della Longa, spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told the Reuters news agency that its local partner had a convoy of ambulances heading north to evacuate patients from Ahli Arab Hospital. “We do hope that this pause in the fighting will give us the possibility of reaching all the people in Gaza, including areas in the north where it was impossible to have access,” he said. PRCS posted on X that along with UN teams they evacuated 25 patients and wounded people, and 20 of their companions, from Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City to the European Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. About 120 other people, including medical staff and those injured, were still trapped in the hospital, the organisation said.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

‘We won’t leave’: Ar­me­ni­ans in Jerusalem push back against armed set­tlers,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/24/we-wont-leave-armenians-in-jerusalem-push-back-against-armed-settlers,"A controversial real estate project threatens the world’s oldest Armenian diaspora community. But they refuse to move. Old City, occupied East Jerusalem –After learning that settlers had returned to bulldoze in an area of the parking lot near his house in theArmenian Quarter, 80-year-old Garo Nalbandian, a professional photographer, joined a community sit-in in the area known as the Cows’ Garden with, of course, his trusty camera. “We won’t leave,” a determined Nalbandian said gruffly in between snapping photos of Armenians on one side of the makeshift barricade and Israeli police and hired security on the other. On October 26, the leader of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem announced it would cancel a once-secret 2021 land lease deal with a real estate company that has alleged links to settler interests. Since then, representatives from the company, Xana Gardens, have sent contractors, armed settlers and bulldozers to seize the land – which, along with the parking lot, includes Armenian Church property and the homes of Nalbandian and four other families. The 1,600-year-old Armenian community is concentrated in the confines of the Armenian Quarter, occupying 14 percent of the Old City of Jerusalem at its southwestern corner. “You know all your neighbours. If I don’t have milk at 1am, I just knock on their door. If I don’t have bread, I call my friend,” said Setrag Balian, 26, one of the leaders of the current movement to reverse the land deal. “We take care of each other’s kids, of our families.” This Armenian community – the oldest Armenian diaspora in the world – has seen itspopulation declinefrom some 27,000 people a century ago to about 1,000 today. Yet, with each attempted demolition, the community flocks in numbers at a moment’s notice, standing in the way of bulldozers while withstanding threats of arrest and armed intimidation. Nalbandian’s family risks losing the home they’ve lived in since 1969, under the deal. Garo’s wife, Hrout, whose family has been in Jerusalem as far back as the 8th or 9th century, describes her sweet memories of the decades of getting engaged, married and raising kids in their modest one-storey home. “Wherever we walk, it’s like we are in Armenia,” she said. “We have like a big family for the Armenians. After so many years … to become homeless, this is very hard.” Garo’s studio in Wadi al-Joz is adorned with breathtaking photos he has taken of streets and cities around the world, from Athens to Alexandria. “But our beautiful Armenian Quarter is like nowhere else,” Garo remarked. “We must protect it.” The community’s suspicions of Israeli settler aspirations in the Cows’ Garden started in 2019 when an Israeli company began construction on that same parking lot. At the time, the patriarchate told the community the aim was to renovate the lot, nothing more, but the parking lot’s April 2021 inauguration was curiously attended by Moshe Lion, the mayor of Jerusalem, and bedecked with enough Israeli flags to raise eyebrows. The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem – the community’s spiritual leadership, biggest employer and de facto landlord – struck a deal in July that year with Xana Gardens, a company incorporated that same month and led by the Australian Israeli investor Danny Rothman. For two years, church leaders kept the community in the dark about the terms or even existence of the deal, despite persistent rumours. On April 1 this year, witnesses say, Rothman – also known in documents as Danny Rubenstein and Danny Kaufman – came to the Cows’ Garden parking lot with security, breaking security cameras and dismissing patriarchate guards, claiming he was taking over. As years of rumours and suspicions about the deal spilled into the open, Setrag Balian and Hagop Djernazian, 23, led the younger generation of Armenians in fighting the land takeover. Balian, who works for his family’s ceramics business, joined Djernazian, a student at Hebrew University, for months of protests near Armenian Patriarch Nourhan Manougian’s offices. “I see myself creating my future here,” said Djernazian, who also leads the Armenian Scouts. “I study here, I work here, I live here. And this is my plan to continue living here. The deal threatens our continued existence here.” A report in July this year by an international team of Armenian lawyers finally exposed the deal publicly. In it, the patriarchate agreed to give Xana Gardens a 49-year lease – with an option to renew another 49 – of the Cows’ Garden to build a luxury hotel. Only Xana Gardens could cancel the agreement, which was for at least 11,500 square metres (123,785 square feet), but Xana could include “adjacent properties in the project”. A plan submitted by Danny Rothman to the Jerusalem Municipality in May sought 14,500sq metres – not 11,500 – for the hotel, with a “target area” of 16,000sq metres (172,222sq feet), according to the report on the deal. Such an area would encompass 13 percent of the entire Armenian Quarter. For this large swath of prized land on contested Mount Zion, Xana Gardens would pay only $300,000 in yearly rent. Miran Krikorian, 40, a restaurant owner born and raised in the Armenian Quarter, says he pays nearly a quarter of that amount for only 30 square metres (323 square feet) he rents nearby for his small restaurant in the Christian Quarter. “Either somebody got money under the table to pass this deal, or it’s just our people are so dumb that they don’t know the prices in this country,” said Krikorian. For months, newly installed security guards from Xana Gardens threatened to ban community members from using the parking lot if they attended the protests, adding to threats church officials allegedly made towards individuals who protested. But the community refused to relent. Pressure on the church to cancel the deal increased when Jordan and the Palestinian Authority withdrew their recognition of Patriarch Manougian in May, as they saw the deal threatening the status quo in the Old City, and amid concerns that stakeholders had not been consulted. The PA, Jordan and Israel are the three political authorities that endow recognition to the patriarchs in Jerusalem. The patriarchate did not respond to a request for comments. “A lot of the younger generation had to learn through this ordeal why it’s important to stay in Jerusalem and why presence matters,” said Kegham Balian, Setrag’s brother and a Jerusalemite Armenian who has written and reported on the issue for Armenian news outlets such as 301. Manougian’s decision to cancel the deal on October 26 put to rest the Armenian community’s internal divide on the issue. Later that same day, however, Israeli heavy machinery arrived at the disputed site to try to begin demolition. Armenians rushed to the Cows’ Garden, standing in front of machinery that was tearing up a pavement and a wall separating the patriarchate parking lot from the community parking lot. Ten days later, on November 5, representatives from Xana Gardens, including Rothman, returned. This time, they brought about 15 settlers with them, several of them armed and leading leashed dogs. “This is our land,” they reportedly told local Armenians. “Leave now.”  But the Armenians refused to leave. A tense standoff ensued for hours, with more settlers arriving and yet more Armenians joining, eventually overwhelming the armed settlers. Some of the settlers attempted to provoke community members, residents said. “You’re all goys, and when the Messiah comes, you will die,” one of them told them. “I will get you, one by one!” George Warwar, a Christian Arab from Jaffa who had been the face of Xana Gardens on the ground in the months leading up to the encounter, reportedly shouted. This was the first time most in the community had encountered Rothman, who, when approached by journalists, has refused to speak to the media. According to Setrag Balian, Rothman, who normally lives overseas, told police during the standoff the community wanted to cancel the deal because he is Jewish.  “It’s because now you’re bringing armed settlers and showing the true face of your company,” Setrag Balian recalled telling Rothman that day. “It’s because this deal is not a good deal for the patriarchate. “We’ve lived with our Jewish Quarter neighbours for 50 years without any major incidents,” he continued. The act of peaceful defiance forced Rothman and his group to withdraw after several hours. “Just by the look on Danny Rothman’s face,” said Kegham Balian, “you could tell he wasn’t expecting the events to unfold like they did that day.” Negotiations are under way for the church to provide greater transparency regarding the administration of community lands and affairs, a key demand from protesters. With the internal divide on the land agreement now set aside – and the war in Gaza drawing the world’s attention – Armenian residents say Xana Gardens’ tactics are shifting to outright armed confrontation. “They thought it would scare us,” said Setrag Balian of the armed threats. “But it didn’t scare us – it empowered us. We are more united than ever.” Manougian, often criticised by Armenians for an absence in leadership, has been present during standoffs this month. A November 16 communique by the Armenian Patriarchate described the situation as “possibly the greatest existential threat of its 16-century history”, condemning the 2021 contract as “tainted with false representation, undue influence, and unlawful benefits”. Armenians fear their small, tight-knit community won’t survive if they lose the Cows’ Garden, which comprises much of the Armenian Quarter outside the Armenian Convent – a private area originally intended for clergy, but now housing many Armenians who moved there about a century ago in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide. The prized land is seen as pivotal to Israeli settler plans, as a long-term lease would complete a path for Jewish worshippers to cross the Old City from Jaffa Gate to the Jewish Quarter without crossing Christian properties, followingprevious purchasesof the New Imperial Hotel and Petra Hotel along that route. Since the first armed confrontation by Rothman and settlers, Armenians have been taking shifts at the Cows’ Garden, where two bulldozers are parked. Contractors hired by Xana Gardens attempted to bulldoze the area early in the morning on November 12 and 13. Both times, the community sprang into action, putting up a metal barricade on the 12 and, on the 13, standing in a bulldozer’s path. The community has remained nonviolent throughout the confrontations, at the behest of movement leaders like Balian and Djernazian. As demolition attempts by the company continue – including an incident on November 15 in which Palestinians hired by Xana Gardens to dismantle the barricade left when they realised they had been hired by settlers – the community remains resolute. During the standoffs, police threatened to arrest Armenians, and several have been arrested for transgressions like shouting, according to community members. They were released the same day, but banned by police from returning to the area. Police have attempted to enforce the bulldozing efforts – although they have failed so far with Xana Gardens unable to present the required permits – before the land deal finds its way to court to be adjudicated, as stakeholders expect to happen. A rotating group of Armenians now sleeps in the Cows’ Garden at night, and community members provide volunteers with food, tea, couches and even a tent for 24/7 surveillance. “This has to do with the future of my kid,” said Krikorian of his four-year-old boy, his eyes welling with tears. “If I think about all those things that my kid is going to lose, like this community, like being with his friends … I grew up in that, and I want him to have the same experiences. “If I don’t do anything now, I’m going to lose it for him in the future.”",
‘The war is not over’: Is­rael blocks Pales­tini­ans’ re­turn to north­ern Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/displaced-people-attempt-to-return-home-across-gaza-as-truce-sets-in,"Israeli military warns people against returning to northern Gaza, saying ‘the war is not over’. Israel has said that northern Gaza is out of bounds as displaced Palestinians attempt to use the pause in fighting to return to their homes. Large numbers of displaced people were attempting to return home across Gaza as the four-day truce brokered by Qatar took effect on Friday morning. However, Israel has warned people that they will not be allowed to enter the north of the war-torn enclave. Videos obtained by Al Jazeera showed Palestinians returning to their homes in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, despite the Israeli army’s insistence that it is a combat zone. At least two Palestinians are reported to have been killed by the Israeli military, and 11 wounded, as they have attempted the trip to northern Gaza.  This is a modal window.

The Israeli military has said that it expects Hamas would try to encourage or push civilians to return to the northern part of the Gaza Strip and that it was prepared to prevent it from happening, Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom reported from occupied East Jerusalem. Israel dropped leaflets over southern Gaza, warning the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians who sought refuge there not to return north amid its ground offensive, reported the Associated Press. Still, hundreds could be seen walking north on Friday. Citing witnesses, Palestinian news agency Wafa said that seven people were wounded by Israeli forces as they attempted the trip to northern Gaza. Several have been injured and taken back to hospitals in the south of the territory, reported Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, from Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Two were shot and killed by Israeli troops and another 11 were wounded in the legs. An AP journalist reported seeing two bodies and the wounded as they arrived at a hospital. An Israeli military spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, released a statement in Arabic on X. “Residents of Gaza, the movement of the population from the south of the Strip to the north will not be allowed in any way, but only from the north to the south,” it read. “We invite you not to approach the military forces and the areas north of the Gaza Valley. Take advantage of the time to replenish your needs and arrange your affairs,” he said. “The area north of the Gaza Strip is a combat zone and it is forbidden to stay there. The war is not over and we urge you to obey the teachings and warnings for your safety,” Adraee added. Many people no longer have a home to go back to after seven weeks of Israeli bombardment and ground invasions that started on October 7. Gaza resident Ashraf Shann told Al Jazeera that he had mixed feelings about the truce. “I have nowhere to go back to even if [the Israelis] allow us to go back to Gaza City. My house was bombed and completely destroyed on the third day of the war,” he said. “At the same time, I’m happy for those people whose loved ones are missing. At least they can go and pick up the pieces and try to search for them.”  Zak Hania, a displaced Palestinian who fled the Shati refugee camp, said “everything is broken in Gaza”. “We don’t know whether to be happy or sad. Our houses are broken, our hearts are broken, everything is broken in Gaza now. We do not know how life will continue after this,” he told Al Jazeera from the southern city of Khan Younis. Asked if he was planning to head home during the truce, Hania responded: “We can’t go because the Israeli army said nobody’s allowed to go back to the north and people are afraid and hesitant to go. “I think it’s dangerous to go back because they’re still on the road separating the north and south of Gaza … We’re not sure about anything and we’re just praying that the ceasefire holds,” he said.

Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said the looming fact that the war will resume in a matter of days was a huge disappointment for people. “There is a sense of happiness, a sense of optimism, but it is a cautious optimism because after 48 days of relentless air strikes and killings, so many Palestinians have been surrounded by destruction and blood, and the bodies of loved ones and family members,” Mahmoud said. “The ceasefire comes when people want to take a moment and just check on each other and check on their homes and belongings,” he said. “There is also the looming fact that the war will resume in a matter of days, according to Israeli officials,” Mahmoud said. “That statement was very devastating and depressing for many Palestinians who believe this ceasefire is incomplete and unfair, as they want to go and check on their homes and see who is left among their family members,” he said. Israel’s war has killed more than 14,800 people in Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas’s attacks before the war stands at about 1,200.",

Is­rael-Hamas truce comes into ef­fect: How it could now un­fold,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/24/israel-hamas-truce-comes-into-effect-how-it-could-now-unfold,"With the truce the first break in fighting after seven weeks, several scenarios in the war are now possible. The mother of thelongest-serving female Palestinian prisonerin Israeli jails is gripped with anxiety, but for once, optimism too. The mother of another prisoner arrested just months after he turned 18, isbaking chocolate cakeand other pastries in anticipation of his release. In Israel, a grandfather wonders whether his three-year-old granddaughter will be released, the toddler among six other family members held captive by Hamas. A Tel Aviv developmental psychologist, meanwhile, worries about the post-trauma signs in children when they return from Gaza. On Friday morning at 7am local time (05:00 GMT), the truce between Israel and Hamas came into force, marking the first break in Israel’s continuousseven-week bombardment of the Gaza Stripfollowing Hamas’s October 7 attack on southern Israel. The four-day pause is expected to see theexchangeof 150 Palestinian women and children imprisoned in Israeli jails for 50 women and children hostages held by Hamas. It also offers an opportunity for aid to filter into the battered enclave where nearly 15,000 people have been killed in the bombing, including more than 6,000 children. Israeli officials, while adamant that the truce is not an end to the war, have also agreed to pause fighting for an additional day for every further 10 captives freed by Hamas. With the truce the first breakthrough in coaxing a cessation of hostilities after weeks of fighting, several scenarios are possible now that it has come into effect. Here is a look at some of them: First, the truce may very well hold, the agreement respected by both parties. While the prisoners and captives are exchanged, humanitarian aid may enter not just southern Gaza as it has in the past few weeks, but could also enter northern Gaza, where Israeli forces are staging aground assault, said Aboud Hamayel, a lecturer at Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank. But while humanitarian aid there will be welcomed, the truce will also prompt the question of what should be done with northern Gaza, as it has largely been emptied of Palestinians, said Sami Hamdi, the managing director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the Middle East. “There will be increasingly loud voices demanding that these Palestinian families be allowed to return to northern Gaza in order to reverse the Israeli attempt at ethnic cleansing,” Hamdi told Al Jazeera. Despite this, the pause in fighting would be a lifeline for many Palestinians, an opportunity for them to recuperate and “take out people from under rubble”, Hamayel told Al Jazeera. In Israel, the return of captives may deliver a small public relations victory for embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been facing mounting pressure from their families since their capture, the analyst said. But it was international pressure in addition to the families’ pressure which obliged the Israeli leader to accept the truce after weeks of refusing similar deals, said Hamdi. International pressure will therefore be critical to ensuring that both sides uphold the truce, agreed Hamayel, with Western actors particularly interested in maintaining regional stability so that the oil economy doesn’t become too volatile.

This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  If international pressure succeeds, or if Hamas agrees to free more of the 237 currently held captives, there may be the possibility that the truce not only sticks, but holds beyond the initial four days, for up to about three weeks. Both sides could use this longer lull in fighting to convalesce, rearrange their troops and gather intelligence for the next phase of the war, said Hamayel. Israel may also use the pause toscope out Hamas tunnels, which it hasn’t yet done, but has hinted at doing. Israel, while signalling it has no intention of ending the war, may also prefer a longer pause as the war is draining its economy and affecting its tourism, said Hamayel. Meanwhile, it may ramp up its raids in the occupied West Bank as the Gaza front cools, the analyst said. More than 226 people have been killed and more than 2,750 injured in the West Bank since October 7. The scenario opposite the two previous ones is of the truce breaking, with Israel having more incentives to break it than Hamas, the analysts said. Hamas doesn’t want to lose credibility with its mediators, while the situation for Palestinian civilians is too dire for the group to risk not giving them a respite from fighting, said Hamayel. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has failed to achieve any of the strategic objectives that he claimed to be seeking when he began military operations, and which compel him to continue the fighting, said Hamdi. “He hasn’t been able to kill any high-profile Hamas officials. He hasn’t been able to wipe out Hamas in Gaza,’ Hamdi said. But Hamas and its regional allies would not take Israel’s breaking of the truce lightly, with the Palestinian armed group expected to fire missiles on Israel in response, and the possibility of a gradual escalation in tensions on multiple fronts of the war, said Hamayel. It is also possible that Hamas may break the truce, with such a response not only prompting Western ire at the group, but it would likely ramp up Israeli aggression from both the air and ground, he added. Its regional allies would still err on the side of caution, and would work towards pursuing a de-escalation of the conflict, said Hamdi.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button. This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  Meanwhile, there is a concern among Israeli officials, including Netanyahu’s allies, that “this hostage exchange is essentially a bid to lure Israel into a permanent ceasefire”, said Hamdi. The prime minister has, as a result, been making assurances that military operations will continue, he added. On Thursday, Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that the war would continue for at least another two months after the end of the truce. But international pressure for a ceasefire is mounting. That was the majority view at asummit of the BRICS groupingearlier this week, the world’s most powerful bloc of emerging economies. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for a humanitarian ceasefire. The truce has opened up a possibility for more diplomatic engagements and solutions to the possible end of a bloody, bitter conflict that has gripped the world, said Hamayel.",
‘Re­lief’ in Gaza as truce takes ef­fect for first time,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/first-truce-begins-in-israels-war-on-gaza,"Aid begins to trickle in to Gaza as the first pause begins after seven weeks of hostilities between Israel and Hamas. A Qatar-mediated four-day truce has taken effect in Israel’s war on Gaza. The first pause after seven weeks of bombardment has been met with relief by Palestinians. During the humanitarian break in the fighting, which began at 7am (05:00 GMT) on Friday, 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and 50 captives held by the Hamas armed group in Gaza are dueto be released. The first releases, which will see 39 Palestinians and 13 Israelis freed, are expected on Friday afternoon. In the hours preceding the start of the truce, Israeli bombing intensified across the Gaza Strip, with attacks in Rafah and the city of Khan Younis in the south, as well as constant artillery shelling in the north of the enclave. Almog Boker, a correspondent for the Israeli station Channel 13, has posted a video online showing Israeli soldiers celebrating from afar as a number of buildings were destroyed in the northern Gaza Strip in the last hour before the start of the truce.  The first pause in the fighting was met with huge relief by Palestinians, who were rejoicing to be safe from Israeli bombardment for the first time in weeks,  Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Khan Younis, southern Gaza. “This is the first time that we have not heard Israeli drones since the beginning of this round of fighting,” he said. “People sense that there is a glimmer of hope that this short-term pause will pave the way for a longer ceasefire.” Under the deal, badly needed aid will be allowed into Gaza. The enclave has been under a total Israeli blockade since the war was triggered by Hamas’s attack on October 7. Egypt said 130,000 litres of diesel and four trucks of gas will be delivered daily to Gaza over the four days. Overall, 200 trucks carrying aid are set to enter Gaza daily. Al Jazeera’s Youmna ElSayed, reporting from the Rafah border crossing, said the flow of trucks carrying fuel and gas had begun. Additional aid would start entering into and the first captives, including elderly women, would be freed at 4pm (14:00 GMT), said Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari in Doha. The total number of hostages to be freed by Hamas will rise to 50 over the four days. Qatar will monitor the truce in real time for possible violations, reported Al Jazeera’s James Bays from Doha. “Qatar has an operations room here in Doha where they are going to get real-time information from Gaza. They have direct links with the Israeli military, with Hamas,” he said. “The idea is that if there is any sort of violation, that because of those direct links, they are going to try and nip it in the bud and make sure that this truce can continue, that this process can continue for the four days,” he added.

Fighting raged on in the hours leading up to the truce, with officials inside the Hamas-ruled enclave saying a hospital in Gaza City was among the targets bombed. Both sides also signalled the pause would be temporary before fighting resumes. The Indonesian Hospital was reeling under relentless bombing, operating without light and filled with bedridden old people and children too weak to be moved, Gaza health officials said. Munir al-Bursh, the Gaza health ministry director, told Al Jazeera that a wounded woman was killed and three others injured. Israel launched its devastating invasion of Gaza after gunmen from Hamas burst across the border fence on October 7, killing 1,200 people and seizing about 240 captives, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel has rained bombs on the besieged enclave, killing more than 14,000 people in Gaza, about 40 percent of them children, according to Palestinian health authorities.

I want to die there’,” the correspondent reported. “One woman with a child said, ‘I pray that these days will get longer and longer, to just feel safe for a day or two’.” However, the Israeli military said its forces will be stationed at the truce lines and will not allow Palestinians to head to northern Gaza.",

The Gaza Ministry of Health reported on Thursday 27 fatalities from a strike on the Abu Hussein School. Run by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the school in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza was housing many displaced Palestinians. Israeli forces also launched fresh attacks on the Indonesian Hospital, targeting the main entrance and power generators. Ashraf al-Qudra, the ministry’s spokesperson, said the hospital had come under “intense bombardment”, and that “large parts of the building” were being targeted. More than 200 patients, medical staff and internally displaced people were currently at the hospital in Beit Lahiya, which has been under siege for a week. The Palestinian death toll from Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has soared to 14,854, the government media office in the blockaded enclave said on Thursday. About 7,000 people remain unaccounted for, including more than 4,700 children, the media office said.",

When Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a ceasefire and an end to the “collective punishment” of the people of Gaza on the sidelines of the BRICS summit this week, his comments added to a steady drumbeat of criticism of Israel since the start of its war with Hamas. “It is necessary to ensure the safe and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance and stop the collective punishment against the people of Gaza through forced eviction, as well as turning off water, electricity and oil,” Xi said on Tuesday via video link at the summit hosted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. China’s initial response to the conflict was cautious and equivocal in apportioning blame. Beijing waited until a day after Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel to call on the “relevant parties” to end hostilities and stress the need for a two-state solution, and did not condemn the Palestinian armed group or mention it by name. But within a week of the attack, Chinese diplomats began to call Israel’s bombardment of Gaza a form of collective punishment and insist that the country’s right to self-defence should be guided by international law and not come at the expense of innocent civilians. Since then, Beijing has called for multilateral and peaceful solutions to the conflict of the kind promoted by the United Nations, where Beijing took the helm of the powerful Security Council earlier this month. China, which has expressed its desire to be a peace broker in the Middle East, this week welcomed the announcement of the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas that took effect on Friday. Chinese state media was quick to claim credit on Beijing’s behalf, with the state-run Global Times saying the ceasefire could be attributed to multiple factors including “the latest UN Security Council resolution adopted under China’s rotating presidency” and “the strong voice of the Global South”. China’s stance on the war is a matter of contention among analysts. While some see a clear pro-Palestinian through-line in Beijing’s foreign policy, others argue it is simply mirroring a global balance of opinion that is increasingly critical of Israel’s bombing campaign. Before the war, China maintained friendly relations with both Israel and the Palestinians. During the Mao Zedong era in the 1960s, Beijing viewed the Palestinian cause as part of the global campaign against imperialism and armed factions of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. China now buys large quantities of oil from Iran, one of Hamas’s main patrons, and key broker Qatar, as well as other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia. Under Xi, China’s comments about the war have been fairly consistent with past statements about Gaza made in 2008, 2014, and 2021, according toThe China Project, typically calling for an end to violence and a mediated resolution. In 2008, for instance, former top diplomat Qin Gang called for an end to “actions that cause injuries and deaths to ordinary people” and for all parties to “exercise maximum restraint and to settle differences through dialogue”. Still, there have been noticeable shifts in Beijing’s rhetoric towards statements that are more critical of Israel, said Benjamin Ho Tze Ern, an assistant professor at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies’ (RSIS) China programme, such as its statement that the country had “gone beyond self-defence”. Ahmed Aboudouh, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, said in a recent commentary that China was clearly signalling its support of the Palestinian side. “The rhetoric from Beijing is carefully designed to focus on the broader context, such as implementing the two-state solution, addressing humanitarian issues and preventing the conflict from turning into a regional one,” Aboudouh wrote in a commentary on Chatham House’s website in October. “It has refrained from describing the Hamas incursion into Israel as a terrorist attack but has called Israel’s retaliation ‘collective punishment’ of Palestinian civilians – signalling its opposition to an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza.” Manoj Kewalramani, a foreign policy analyst for the Bangalore-based Takshashila institution, said China’s statements during the most recent conflict have shown a distinct pro-Palestine bent. “Since [October 8], Beijing has been critical of Israel’s actions, warning about violations of humanitarian law and against ‘collective punishment. It has consistently called for a ceasefire, the need to avoid a spill-over of the conflict and the need to host a broader peace conference with a clear roadmap for a two-state solution,” Kewalramani said. China has also not shied away from positively expressing its support for Palestinians. Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a group of visiting diplomats from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Indonesia that China was a “good friend and brother of Arab and Muslim countries” and a firm supporter “of the cause of the Palestinian people”. However, Hongda Fan, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, rejected the notion that Beijing is “biased against Israel”. Fan said Beijing’s position simply reflects the balance of global public opinion amid mounting civilian casualties in Gaza, where at least 14,532 have been killed, according to Palestinian health authorities. “The ‘two-state solution’ has not yet gained universal acceptance in Israel. In addition, China’s relations with Arab countries and Iran have been developing relatively smoothly in recent years. These factors combine to make China appear to be siding with Palestine. Not really,” he said. “And overall, international public opinion is becoming increasingly unfavourable to Israel, which also shows that China’s position is not biased against Israel,” he said. RISIS’s Ho said the conflict has helped China score points against the United States, its main competitor, which is Israel’s biggest ally and backer. As US officials travelled through the region in October and November, Chinese diplomats did the same, visiting countries including Qatar, Iran, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, while also meeting with Israeli representatives in Beijing. “Since US policies seem to be more aligned with Israel, it is not surprising that China tends to align with Palestine, which is also viewed as the underdog,” Ho told Al Jazeera. “This reflects China’s ‘underdog diplomacy’ and that it wants to be seen as on the side – or at least, demonstrating support for – states that are being ostracised by the West.”",
Analy­sis: How to en­force the Is­rael-Hamas truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/analysis-how-to-enforce-the-israel-hamas-truce,"The truce has come into effect. Its execution will fall on two fighting forces that have been trying to kill the other. Thepausewas agreed to on Tuesday night, announced on Wednesday and was expected to temporarily halt the war on Thursday morning. But the fighting did not stop and in fact, seemed to intensify. Aerial bombardment continued, supporting Israeli forces trying to get as close as possible to the centre of Gaza City before the truce. Hamas fighters set up ambushes to incapacitate as many tanks and armoured personnel carriers as possible before the ceasefire stops all military activity for 96 hours. The last two days must have been the most nerve-racking for fighters on both sides since the beginning of the ground campaign. Military historians have written volumes on the simultaneous anxiety, stress, expectation, hope, mental pressure and existential fear of soldiers in the hours before a ceasefire or truce. In all wars, wherever and however they are fought, no soldier wants to be the last casualty before the guns go silent. As they hear the news of the imminent pause, their natural reaction is to relax, ease the efforts, for soon they are to stop all activity. Rather than allowing that, their officers – following orders and pressure from their respective civilian authorities – push them to press on for another day, two or three. Soldiers, themselves unit commanders, hate to have to do it, knowing what effect such orders have on troop morale, but they cannot disobey their superiors. That tense anticipation of theZero Hourwhen they will, at least temporarily, lay down their weapons, is almost certainly the most stressful time of their military career. Civilian authorities certainly must know this, so why have they allowed Zero Hour to slip to 7am on Friday, prolonging the agony of their own soldiers? Some of it is just civilian officialdom. An alleged reason that postponed the pause was that the agreement was not formally signed by Qatar and Hamas, “only officially announced”. More red tape was involved in “clarifying the names on the lists of those to be released”. All those seemingly unnecessary obstacles delayed the start of the pause. In all fairness, the bureaucracy is not the only thing to blame for the slow implementation of the agreement, it is just the most visible, but military commands were not rushing either. For the truce to work, it must be made workable in the first place. Politicians agree in broad terms: “Let’s pause the fighting and exchange people”. The wording defines intent and scope, but exactly how to implement what has been agreed upon always falls to those on the ground: the military. It is not an easy task: Officers of two enemies who have been trying to kill each other now have to talk – as fighting rages. I have seen many ceasefires and prisoner exchanges, but do not remember a single one where a political agreement signed by big bosses could be implemented without the adversaries on the battleground working out the fine print, for the devil is always in the detail. To start with, some officers are chosen to study the agreement and, knowing the situation on the battlefield, determine how they will carry it out. They need to decide viable, safe routes for the buses taking hostages and prisoners from one side to another, agree if the buses will have civilian or military drivers and possibly guards, decide if guards would be armed or not. Will they be accompanied bymedical personnel? At what point will they be released or transferred from one set of buses to another? Will any soldiers participating in the exchange cross into enemy territory, and, if so, when and how will they return? Who’s responsible for clearing the roads of rubble and mines and to what point? And many more sticky, difficult issues. Establishing first contact is easier than most people think: The adversaries listen to each other’s radio communications and often use the same walkie-talkie channels. In moments of relative calm, they will taunt each other: boasting, threatening, insulting, belittling, cursing … But after the pause was announced someone certainly called the other side and said: “My commander wants to talk to your commander about the truce.” First, they need to confirm their authority, then start arranging an initial consultation, usually with both sides promising to keep the proposed meeting place safe and agreeing on how many negotiators and aides would meet face to face. The moment the opposing envoys first meet is the tensest, as any seemingly trivial detail can collapse the whole deal. Who will salute first? What happens if one representative declines to shake the other’s hand? Does an Israeli officer give a military salute, given that for the Israeli side, the opposite number is a “terrorist”? What happens if they cannot agree on some issues? With so many potential traps, the two sides often prefer to use an intermediary they trust to can help clarify matters, defuse tensions and propose mutually acceptable solutions, a middle-of-the-road approach where neither negotiating side would lose face. It helps if the intermediary knows the situation and has dealt with both sides in the past. In Gaza, that will be the International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent (ICRC). As announced by Qatar on Thursday, the first captives are to be released at 4pm on Friday, just nine hours after the fighting is supposed to stop. That suggests that most details I listed here have already been ironed out, and that gives reason for cautious optimism. The only slight doubt in my mind is the practicality and wisdom of starting an exchange of civilians at a time when the darkness is starting to set in. Conducting any business after the sun sets is never a very good idea in a combat zone.",

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has welcomed the truce and release of captives from Gaza, and called for steps to be taken “towards a sustainable ceasefire and long-term, enduring peace”. In a post on social media, Albanese said the freeing of captives and allowing humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip “represents important progress and Australia welcomes them”.  The US branch of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said Hani Almadhoun lost his brother, sister-in-law and their children in Israeli attacks on Gaza. “These senseless losses deepen the grief and losses that Hani and our colleagues have already shouldered,” UNRWA USA said. “Hani’s family is among tens of thousands of Palestinians who have been tragically killed in Israeli military air strikes across Gaza since October 7.”  The National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) pointed to remarks by Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders, including Defence Minister Gallant whosaid last monththat Israel was fighting “human animals”. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as well as “his government, and all Canadian leaders must condemn the horrific language”, NCCM said. The group added that the rhetoric “has fueled” the deaths of thousands of Palestinian civilians in Gaza since October 7.  Reporting from Buenos Aires, Argentina The upscale neighbourhood of Recoleta was pulsing with the sound of drums and chanting last month, as protesters gathered outside the Palestinian embassy in Buenos Aires to call for an end to Israel’s war in Gaza. But amid the sea of Palestinian flags, Silvia Ferreyra gripped a different symbol of solidarity. Above her head, she held a banner depicting a blue ribbon of water trapped behind a lock and chain. Printed above the picture in large red type was the phrase, “Fuera Mekorot”. Ferreyra, 52, had a simple message. She wanted Mekorot, Israel’s state-run water company, out of Argentina.

Muhammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Gaza’s largest hospital, wasdetainedby Israeli forces yesterday along with five other health workers while transferring patients to the south of the enclave. The WHO said in a statement that two of the six have been released. “We do not have information about the wellbeing of the four remaining health staff, including the director of al-Shifa Hospital. WHO calls for their legal and human rights to be fully observed during their detention,” it said. The agency added that the health workers were detained at an Israeli checkpoint “despite an initial agreement to only screen participants at the origination point in al-Shifa Hospital”. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza had said it wanted an explanation from the WHO and would stop coordination with the agency on evacuations until they got a report explaining what happened.  “It is okay to rejoice, and to shed a tear, it is a human thing, but I do not celebrate and will not celebrate until the last one returns,” Yoni Asher said in a video posted on social media, as reported by Israeli daily Haaretz. Asher’s wife, Doron Katz-Asher, 34, and his daughters, Raz and Aviv, 4 and 2, respectively, were released from Gaza today. “There are people whose hearts are broken right now, and I want to make sure all the hostages return. The families of the hostages are not a poster or a slogan, they are real people, and from today they are my new family,” he said.

Hamas says 30 killed in Is­raeli at­tack on UN school ahead of Gaza truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/dozens-killed-in-israeli-attack-on-un-school-in-gaza-ahead-of-truce,"Ahead of planned four-day pause in hostilities Israel says war to continue for two months after ‘brief respite’. Hamas has said that about 30 people were killed in an Israeli attack on a United Nations-affiliated school in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, as the clock ticks down on aplanned trucebetween the Palestinian group and Israel. On Thursday, the Gaza Ministry of Health reported 27 fatalities from that strike on the Abu Hussein School run by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which was housing displaced Palestinians fleeing violence and intense bombardment in other parts of Gaza. Israeli forces also launched fresh attacks on theIndonesian Hospitalin northern Gaza, targeting the main entrance and power generators. Ashraf al-Qudra, the ministry’s spokesperson, said the hospital had come under “intense bombardment”, and that “large parts of the building” were being targeted. More than 200 patients, medical staff, and internally displaced people were currently at the hospital in Beit Lahiya, which has been under siege for a week. Meanwhile, Israeli fighter jets hit the Sheikh Nasser neighbourhood in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, killing at least five people and wounding dozens, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa. It also reported that at least 10 people were killed when Israeli forces attacked a residential home in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood in northern Gaza. In the occupied West Bank, 12-year-old Mohammed Ibrahim Fuad Edely was shot and killed by Israeli forces, according to the Palestinian ministry. The incident brought the number of Palestinians killed in the occupied West Bank sinceOctober 7to 229, 52 of them children. Israel’s relentless bombardments have killed more than 14,800 people in Gaza since October 7, according to Palestinian officials. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas’s attacks stands at about 1,200. Mediator Qatar announced that afour-day trucebetween Israel and Hamas is set to begin at 7am local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday. But Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called the upcoming pause a “brief respite … at the end of which the fighting will continue intensely, and we will create pressure to bring back more hostages” during an interview with a navy special operations unit on Thursday. “At least another two months of fighting is expected,” he said. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: “The [captive release] outline is not the end of the process but the beginning.” “In the coming days, we will focus on planning and completing the preparations for the next stages of combat.” A spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing, Abu Obeida, said that Palestinian fighters remain ready to confront Israeli forces so long as the war continues and called for resistance to Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.",
What are the de­tails of the truce be­tween Is­rael and Hamas?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/what-to-know-about-the-upcoming-truce-between-israel-and-hamas,"Four-day pause is set to begin on Friday morning and includes the release of Hamas captives and Palestinian prisoners. Mediator Qatar has announced that afour-day trucebetween Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, based in the Gaza Strip, is set to begin at 7am local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday.

Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry in Qatar, which has played a key role in mediation between the two sides, said thatthe trucewould take effect at 7am (05:00 GMT) on Friday. At 4pm (14:00 GMT), a group of 13 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza will be released. The key components are a pause in the fighting, the exchange of Hamas captives for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, and a halt to air traffic over northern Gaza during certain hours of the day and over southern Gaza entirely. Over the course of four days, Hamas will release 50 women and children, from about 240 peopletaken captiveby the group during its assault on southern Israel on October 7. In exchange, Israel will release a total of 150 Palestinian women and children held inIsraeli prisons, whom Palestinians have long characterised as victims of an Israeli occupation that sweeps them into prisons with little pretence of due process. Israel has given a list of about 300 Palestinian prisoners who may be released, none of whom have been accused of murder and many of whom were held under arbitrary detention without trial.

Israeli Army Radio has said that the first batch of 39 Palestinian prisoners will be released at about 8pm (18:00 GMT) on Friday, and that this will only occur if the hostages held in Gaza are on Israeli soil. Israel has said that the pause will be extended by one day for every 10 additional hostages released. Qatar has also stated that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will work in Gaza to help facilitate the release process. In a statement on Thursday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel had received a list of those being released and has notified theirfamilies. The development has broughtrelief for some, but despair for others. Asked about the status of armed activity under the deal, chief Qatari negotiator Mohammed Al-Khulaifi said “no attack whatsoever” would take place. “No military movements, no expansion, nothing,” he said. Hamas has said that Israel agreed to suspend air traffic over northern Gaza from 10am (08:00 GMT) until 4pm (14:00 GMT) each day, and over southern Gaza for the entirety of the truce. The group said that Israel agreed not to attack or arrest anyone in Gaza, and that people can move freely along Salah al-Din Road, the main street along which many Palestinians have fled northern Gaza, where Israel launched its ground invasion. Hamas also said that itsarmed wingand all other “Palestinian factions” will halt “all military activity” when the truce enters into effect. The group said that 200 aid trucks and four fuel trucks will be allowed into Gaza each day, as Palestinian civilians reel from a humanitarian crisis caused by weeks of Israeli bombardment and harsh restrictions onaccess to food, fuel, electricity and water. Probably not. While countries such asQatar, humanitarian groups, and world leaders have expressed hope that the truce could pave the way for a long-term ceasefire, both Israel and Hamas have expressed their intent to fight on. On Thursday, a spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing, Abu Obeida, said that Palestinian fighters remain ready to confront Israeli forces so long as the war continues and called for resistance to Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.

Span­ish PM pro­pos­es talks on the es­tab­lish­ment of a Pales­tin­ian state,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/spanish-pm-proposes-talks-on-the-establishment-of-a-palestinian-state,"In meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Spain’s Pedro Sanchez proposes international peace talks. Spanish Prime MinisterPedro Sanchezhas called for the establishment of a viable Palestinian state after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Sanchez, whose new government was sworn in earlier this month, proposed an international peace conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during talks with Netanyahu on Thursday. The Socialist leader also met Israeli President Isaac Herzog and was set for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank later on Thursday before travelling on to Egypt. “Today, more than ever, we need to bring back a serious and credible prospect for peace,” Sanchez said after talks with Netanyahu. “Without a political settlement, we are bound to run again into a never-ending cycle of violence.” While Sanchez stressed that he backed Israel’s right to defend itself following the “atrocities” carried out by Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, on October 7, he said the number of Palestinians killed in Israel’s military response “is truly unbearable”. Around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed when Hamas fighters from Gaza attacked southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities, and around 240 others were taken as captives to Gaza. Since the attack, Israel has bombarded Gaza in an air and ground assault and severely restricted supplies of water, food and fuel to the 2.3 million residents of the territory. More than 14,500 people, including more than 6,000 children, have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities. The last US-brokered round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014 and the prospects of a revival appear to have dimmed amid the continuing Israel-Hamas war. Sanchez said he and unspecified colleagues had proposed holding an international peace conference with the parties as soon as possible. He said the European Union, Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had all endorsed the idea. “It is in Israel’s interest to work for peace, and today, peace means the establishment of a viable Palestinian state that includes the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, according to the UN resolutions,” he said. United States officials have said the time is not right to try to resume peace talks given the protracted intransigence of both sides. Sanchez attended the meetings alongside his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo. Their two countries hold the current and upcoming rotating presidencies of the Council of the European Union, respectively. Last week, Sanchez said a Union for the Mediterranean summit in Barcelona on November 27-28 would be an “ideal place” to relaunch Israeli-Palestinian dialogue as the two sides would “sit on an equal footing” there. Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs limited parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, are members of the Mediterranean grouping along with neighbours Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. In 1991, Madrid hosted a multilateral peace conference aimed at resolving the conflict through negotiations based on a “land for peace” formula, eventually leading to the 1993 Oslo interim accords that set up the PA. But a series of follow-up negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian state in territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war foundered on intractable differences over borders, Palestinian refugees, Israel’s steady expansion of settlements on occupied land, and the status of Jerusalem. As he was sworn in for a new term this month, Sanchez said his foreign policy priority would be to “work in Europe and in Spain to recognise the Palestinian state”. Several smaller European nations such as Sweden and Malta have recognised Palestine, but so far no major EU member has taken this step. Sanchez governs in a minority coalition with hard-left formation Sumar. In October, Israel’s embassy to Spain accused some of Sanchez’s ministers of aligning themselves with Hamas after a hard-left cabinet minister called Israel’s military offensive in Gaza “a genocide”. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron also met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday after visiting the south of the country. He said the agreedfour-day trucewas an opportunity to get some of the Israeli captives out of Gaza and that he hoped “everyone who is responsible and behind this agreement can make it happen”. “There’s no hope for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, between Israel and the Arab states, if we don’t eradicate this murderous movement that threatens the future of all of us,” Cameron said, referring to Hamas.

"Un­cer­tain­ty, hope for Pales­tin­ian, Is­raeli fam­i­lies be­fore Gaza truce",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/mixed-reactions-among-palestinians-israelis-over-prisoner-captive-exchange,"Amid high tensions over captives-for-prisoners swap, far-right Israeli minister demands clampdown on celebrations. Both Palestinians and Israelis have shared their mixed reactions to the announcement of a brieftruce in Gaza, which will see Israeli captives held by Hamas being exchanged in stages with Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. While there is a sense of excitement and anticipation at the possible release and return of a loved one, there is also a feeling of sadness and disappointment aboutthe relentless war on Gazaand the widespread suffering. Maha Arafat, from Nablus in the occupied West Bank, has been awaiting the release of her daughter Maryam from an Israeli jail. “We didn’t expect the swap to be this way. So many victims in Gaza. Images that no one can comprehend,” she told Al Jazeera. “Sometimes I’ll say, I don’t want my daughter released. Just let Gaza be. We are so affected by what’s happening there.” Mediator Qatar announced on Thursday that Israel and Hamas agreed to afour-day pausein fighting, which includes the exchange of some of the captives taken by Palestinian group Hamas during an attack in southern Israel on October 7, for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody. The truce is set to begin on Friday at 7am (05:00 GMT). The first batch of hostages being held in Gaza – 13 women and children – will be released at approximately 4pm (14:00 GMT) and handed over to the Red Cross. Palestinian prisoners are also meant to be released on Friday. Under the agreement, Hamas will free a total of 50 captives, while Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners. About 5,200 Palestinians were in Israeli prisons before October 7, and 3,000 have since been arrested, including 145 children and 95 women. Who among the long list of Palestinian prisoners will be allowed to leave and when is in the hands of the Israeli authorities. Nisreen al-Titi, also from Nablus, and the sister of a Palestinian prisoner, told Al Jazeera that she has mixed emotions about her possible release. It remains unclear if her sister Aseel – who has been in prison for more than a year after being accused by Israel of trying to stab an Israeli guard while visiting her incarcerated brother – will be freed. But her family remains hopeful. “Our uncle was killed, and our brother was shot while Aseel was in prison. She doesn’t know. When she’s released, she’ll see that life has changed,” said al-Titi. “Yes we are happy, but it’s definitely incomplete.” Israel’s hardline Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir has instructed the head of the country’s prison service, Katy Perry, to quash attempts to celebrate prisoner releases within incarceration facilities, reported the Times of Israel. He reportedly also told Israeli police commissioner Kobi Shabtai to use “an iron fist” against attempts to celebrate prisoner releases or support terrorism. Al Jazeera senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said: “They won’t let the Palestinians mourn or celebrate. If mourning or celebrating isn’t allowed, what is allowed? If you cannot resist peacefully, how else can people bring about freedom for their loved ones?” Reporting from Nablus, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said that the families of Palestinian prisoners were tense amid news that no West Bank prisoners would be released as part of the deal. “This is an intrinsic issue for every Palestinian. They have either spent time in an Israeli prison or know someone who has. For Palestinians, this has been a very tense time. We have been speaking to families of people who have been named on the list, but they say they still have not been told anything and have no confirmation,” he said. “Not knowing is something that has been completely consuming them. There was excitement when we met with them earlier yesterday [Thursday],” he said, but noted that many remain sceptical and believe their family members or others could always be rearrested, as has been the case in the past. More than 14,500 people have been killed in Israel’s attacks on Gaza since October 7, including nearly 6,000 children. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas’s assault stands at about 1,200. “I didn’t win the lottery,” said Guy Metzger, after hearing that his mother was not among the first group of Israelis set to be released. His parents Tamar Metzger, 78, and Yoram Metzger, 80, were taken captive. Metzger told The Wall Street Journal newspaper that he hoped his mother, Tamar, could still be among the women and children set to be released in the coming days. The deal does not include any adult men. Gideon Levy, a columnist with Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said the release of some hostages will spark both celebration and mourning in Israel, with many others still being held. “Right now Israelis are supporting the continuation of the war, but there will be a moment in which Israel will have to ask herself – until when and what will come after and at what price are we going to continue? All those are open questions now and the coming days will show if we are going for another escalation after the truce,” he said. Basravi reported that “people say they are grateful about the ceasefire but they feel it will be an incomplete happiness if their loved ones are not released”, adding that many fear a truce in Gaza would mean an uptick in the alreadyintensifying raids in the occupied West Bank.

BBC ac­cused of cen­sor­ing acts of Gaza sol­i­dar­i­ty in BAF­TA awards cov­er­age,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/bbc-accused-of-censoring-acts-of-gaza-solidarity-in-bafta-awards-coverage,"Ceasefire calls by artists during a ceremony in Scotland did not make the final cut on the BBC’s streaming service. Glasgow, Scotland –The BBC has been accused of editing out multiple calls for a ceasefire in Gaza in its coverage of an entertainment awards ceremony in Scotland. The Scottish arm of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) held its ceremony on Sunday in Glasgow. At the event, some public figures used their moment on stage to express solidarity with Palestinians from the besieged enclave. But they later found their words of support cut from the final edit of the show, which appeared on the British public service broadcaster’s streaming service, iPlayer. Among those to accuse the BBC of censorship was director Eilidh Munro, who prevailed in BAFTA Scotland’s best Short Film and Animation category. She used her acceptance speech to call on guests to “use your voice as filmmakers and artists” to lobby for a halt to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, as her colleague Finlay Pretsell displayed a poster that read, “I refuse to be silent. Ceasefire now.” While Munro’s entire award-winning segment, which included her acceptance speech, was seen by viewers watching the livestream version produced by BAFTA Scotland, it was not included in the final BBC iPlayer edit. Munro told Scotland’s The National newspaper: “It is deeply concerning that the BBC decided to cut the entire segment of our award acceptance speech from their coverage of the BAFTA Scotland Awards. “It is also somewhat surreal that an event which celebrates artists and filmmakers for using their voices and creating work to speak out against injustice can also be censored.” She added to The National: “In my opinion, the BBC’s editorial decision to omit these peaceful signs of solidarity is neither neutral nor impartial.”   Pretsell’s poster is understood to have come from the campaigners who had gathered outside the ceremony’s venue at a Glasgow hotel. Art Workers for Palestine Scotland handed out pro-Palestinian paraphernalia to attendees, including Scotland’s Muslim First Minister Humza Yousaf. Yousaf was seen at the event with his Scottish-Palestinian wife Nadia El-Nakla, whose parents escaped Gaza after becoming trapped in the Palestinian territory for weeks after the start of the bloody conflict. Social media users outraged by the BBC edits have been sharing a video clip by the popular American TikTok user YourFavoriteGuy, who alleged the British broadcaster does not care “about [the Gazan] genocide or the Palestinians”. More than 14,500 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli air strikes in a matter of weeks. Israel’s bombardment began in retaliation for the Hamas attack on southern Israel nearly 50 days ago, during which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage. Atruceis hoped to take hold early on Friday. A BBC spokesperson told Al Jazeera that “the programme on iPlayer is a highlights show and therefore significantly shorter than the actual event itself”. The spokesperson added: “Some edits were made so the content was compliant with BBC editorial guidelines on impartiality.” According to those rules, which are published on the BBC’s website, the broadcaster “must be inclusive, considering the broad perspective and ensuring that the existence of a range of views is appropriately reflected. It does not require absolute neutrality on every issue or detachment from fundamental democratic principles, such as the right to vote, freedom of expression and the rule of law”.",
"Is­rael-Hamas truce, cap­tive re­lease to be­gin on Fri­day, Qatar says",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/qatar-says-israel-hamas-truce-hostage-release-to-begin-friday,"Truce to begin in the morning and 13 people held by Hamas to be freed in the afternoon, Qatari official says. A four-day truce between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas will begin on Friday morning withcivilian captivesset to be released from the Gaza Strip later in the day, a spokesman for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said the four-day truce will begin at 7am (05:00 GMT) and 13 captives held by Hamas will be released at 4pm (14:00 GMT) with increased humanitarian aid entering Gaza “as soon as possible”. “Those hostages who are from the same families will be put together within the same batch,” he said. “Every day will include a number of civilians as agreed to total 50 within the four days.” Palestinians would be released from Israeli prisons as part of the deal, which also includes a cessation of hostilities across Gaza, he said. Israel and Hamas, which have been at war since October 7, announced a deal on Wednesday allowing at least 50 captives in Gaza and scores of Palestinian prisoners to be freed during the truce.

The initial 13 captives scheduled to be released by Hamas are women and children, and al-Ansari said that while he could not disclose the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released on Friday, he said the deal was “reciprocal, so we’re expecting a release to happen also on the Israeli side”. Al-Ansari also said the Red Cross was coordinating with all parties involved with the release of the captives held in Gaza. “Our main objective here is the safety of the hostages,” he said. The armed wing of Hamas confirmed in a statement on Telegram that the four-day truce would start at 7am. During the truce, all military actions by Hamas’s Qassam Brigades and Israeli forces would cease, the statement added. The Israeli prime minister’s office said Israel received an initial list of hostages to be released from Gaza. “The relevant authorities are checking the details of the list and are presently in contact with all the families,” it said in a statement. The announcement comes after almost seven weeks of devastating fighting after Hamaslaunched attackson southern Israel on October 7, which killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials, and took more than 240 hostage. In Israel, families of those taken hostagehave pleadedfor the return of their loved ones. Numerous people from other countries were also taken captive in the assault. Israel has responded to the Hamas attacks with a devastating assault on the besieged Gaza Strip,severely restricting accessto food, electricity and fuel for its more than 2.3 million residents and levelling entire neighbourhoods in a relentless bombardment asIsraeli ground forcesbattle with Hamas fighters in northern Gaza.

Palestinian authorities said at least 14,532 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, including 6,000 children, and humanitarian conditions have sharply deteriorated under constant siege and bombardment. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians havebeen displacedwith few options for seeking refuge in the tightly packed strip. While humanitarian organisations have stressed that only a permanent ceasefire can address the catastrophic scale of civilian suffering in Gaza, many Palestinians, exhausted after weeks of continuous bombing, havewelcomed the pauseas a much-needed respite. Speaking with Al Jazeera after the truce was first announced on Wednesday, Gaza resident Khaled Loz said he plans to use the truce to catch up on sleep. “It’s the first thing I want to do,” he said. “I’m tired of all the continuous bombing.”",
The Take: In­side the Hamas-Is­rael truce deal,https://www.aljazeera.com/podcasts/2023/11/23/the-take-inside-the-hamas-israel-truce-deal,"The deal between Israel and Hamas took weeks of negotiations involving several countries and competing interests.  Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement for the first time since the war in Gaza began 47 days ago. In a deal mediated by Qatar, the sides agreed to a four-day truce, as well as the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners and the resumption of humanitarian convoys. But as Israel’s deadly military strikes on Gaza continue, how will this deal change realities on the ground?

The people of Gaza are exhausted and would dearly love to sleep deeply, be warm, look for missing family, perhaps play outside, and maybe go see what’s left of their house. As Palestinians wait with bated breath for a pause in the Israeli bombardment, we look at the Middle East this week: Hoping to dodge bombs while hunting for enough food to keep your family alive for one more day has been the reality for the people of Gaza for more than six weeks. Now, the people who spoke to Al Jazeera said, they are hoping that a “humanitarian pause” in Israel’s bombing, brokered by Qatar, will give them a chance toregain some semblance of normalcy, even if it’s just for a few days. An exchange of captives is planned for the pause, with families of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jailswaiting anxiously to hear if their loved ones will be among the 150 prisonersto be released by Israel. Fidaa, for one, is busily tidying her house in hopes that her son, Ubai, may be among the women and children released from Israeli prisons. She’spreparing his favourite meal.  This is a modal window.

As Israelintensifies its attacks on Gaza in the lead-upto the “humanitarian pause”, itcontinues to target hospitals. Its repeated claim since its assault on Gaza began has been that Hamas has a tunnel and command bunker under the Gaza Strip’s biggest hospital, al-Shifa. But when Israeli forces took control of the hospital,what they showed the world was underwhelming. Earlier in the week, there was a flash of rare good news as31 premature babies in critical condition were evacuatedfrom Gaza and taken to Egypt. Their lives had been endangered by al-Shifa Hospital’s loss of electricity due to the conflict. Throughout, many havewondered why Israel would target hospitals, and experts have told us the answer is obvious: psyops. But that hasn’t intimidatedthe doctors who work for days on endwith no sleep to save as many people as they can. Nor people like Jawdat Sami al-Madhoun, who is not a doctor, rather someone who only studied nursing for a year and a half.

Our strategic analyst took a look at the two sides of the conflict in Gaza, to try to determine who would get the most out of a pause, and he reached an interesting conclusion:Israel would benefit more. And even though many have said Hamas would use a pause to regroup, Zoran Kusovactells us that that is not the case. People in Gaza have beensurviving on less than 10 percentof the humanitarian aid they used to receive before Israel imposed a complete siege on the territory.

"‘One minute to say good­bye’ to a fa­ther, son, hus­band: Hus­sein Abu Jamei",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/26/one-minute-to-say-goodbye-to-a-father-son-husband-hussein-abu-jamei,"Hussein was just 32 when he was killed by an Israeli air raid on Khan Younis in October. His body was found by his own brother. Khan Younis, Gaza Strip– It was 1am when the group of first responders in Khan Younis received the call – there had been an Israeli air raid nearby. Along with his colleagues, Sayyed Mohammed Abu Jamei rushed to the site and started digging through the rubble to find any survivors. In the middle of scrabbling frantically through the debris, Sayyed found himself looking at the body of his own brother, Hussein. In the early hours of October 24, shocked and grief-stricken, he listened as a nearby wailing grew louder – before realising it was coming from himself. Hussein’s mother, his wife Hadeel Abu Abed and their children all rushed to the hospital. They arrived only a few moments before he was buried, managing only a rushed final farewell inside a dangerously overcrowded morgue. “They had one minute to say goodbye,” said Sayyed, 46. “The children were able to kiss him. But his wife and my mother only looked at him for the last time. “My mother wished she could kiss him, but she couldn’t because of the crowd.” Talking to Al Jazeera in the hospital’s waiting area, Sayyed’s eyes drifted as he tried to sum up who his brother was: “He was decent, he was level-headed, he was polite,” he repeated, over and over. Hussein was only 32 when he died – killed by an Israeli missile that hit a residential neighbourhood in southern Khan Younis where he was sheltering with friends and extended family members. His dream was to pay off some loans he had taken to build a small apartment above his parent’s house and to buy a car. Eventually, he wanted to save up enough to buy a piece of land to build a bigger house for his wife, three children, and unborn baby. He often told his brother how much wanted his children to have a place where they could create beautiful memories. To achieve this dream, Hussein worked long hours as a driver, doing odd jobs from dusk to dawn in the besieged Gaza Strip. “My brother was one of those people who you would like from the moment you met,” Sayyed said. “He had an ease and calm about him that would draw people to him.” Twenty days before he was killed, Hussein had taken his pregnant wife and three children, Abdallah, 10, Ahmed, 7, and Hoda, three, to stay at his in-laws’ home in Bani Souhaila, further south in the strip. He had also left the family’s apartment in the east of Khan Younis and moved to the south of the city. When they fell in love, Hadeel and Hussein had already been neighbours for a while. They had a traditional Palestinian wedding, complete with a zaffeh (wedding procession) and have celebrated their wedding anniversary every year. “Hadeel was everything to him,” Sayyed said. “He cherished and respected her, and tried to provide her with everything she needed. “The day each of his children was born, Hussein was overjoyed and distributed sweets in the neighbourhood to share his joy,” Sayyed added. “Hussein had a special bond with his kids. He was a child at heart and doted on his children despite the hardships of his life. “He made sure to take time out of his busy day to play with them and to do the things they liked to do. He even used to play with them in the street.” Hussein missed his children terribly during the period they were separated, Sayyed said. He tried to go see them as often as he could – the last time was on the day before he was killed. Despite the danger, he checked also on his parents in the al-Zana district in eastern Khan Younis, five kilometres (3.1 miles) away, every two to three days. “Hussein had a very warm and loving relationship with my parents and siblings. He was very attached to his kids and wife. God help them. He would make sure to help the children with their homework, he wanted them to excel. He would call them ‘Dr Abdallah’, ‘Dr Hoda’,” Sayyed said, his voice trembling. Asked about how Hussein’s wife was doing, he said despairingly: “We have 10,000 martyrs in Gaza. She reacted like any of the people who have lost loved ones.” Sombre and exhausted, Sayyed thought about what his brother would have wanted if he had lived. “He wasn’t a man of grand ambitions. He wanted what an average young man his age wanted: to be content, have a decent life, and live in peace.” This article was produced in collaboration withEgab.",
Is­raeli set­tlers steal Pales­tin­ian farm­ers’ land in oc­cu­pied West Bank,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/26/israeli-settlers-steal-palestinian-farmers-land-in-occupied-west-bank,"Emboldened by curfews and raids on Palestinians, illegal settlers have stepped up violence and property theft. Farmers in the occupied West Bank face near-daily incursions and violence from Israeli settlers, to the point that they live in fear of having their homes and land stolen, they say. Added to that is the violence they witness in nearby urban areas, likeJenin city and refugee campthat the Israeli army stepped up raids on, killing 10 people and wounding 20 in just one week. According to the Ministry of Health, at least 237 Palestinians have been killed and about 2,850 others injured by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank since October 7. Farmer Ayman Assad, 45, and his family can clearly hear the attacks from their home just 2km (1.2 miles) from the camp and they have made the past few weeks a nightmare for him, his wife and five children. “The children are constantly scared, and they don’t play outside any more, it’s too dangerous,” he told Al Jazeera. “We can hear the attacks on the refugee camp, explosions and gunshots.” Assad said his children are no longer going to school because even if they were to brave the route there, the Israeli army is blocking many of the roads in the area. All classes have gone online. The greatest worry right now is that his chicken farm, which is further away in Area C of the West Bank, will be attacked by Israeli settlers while he is unable to defend it. “I’m scared my land will be stolen.” Palestine is known for its olives, olive oil and vegetables, which are exported far and wide. The olive trees, in particular, are an important symbol of Palestinians’ attachment to their land. The West Bank has been occupied by Israel since 1967. Since then, about 700,000 Israeli settlers have illegally settled in the Palestinian territory. and havebeen stealing from, attacking and destroying olive groves, farmland and property there for years. But these incursions have stepped up in recent weeks, asIsraeli forces and settlers mount armed raidswhile Palestinians areconfined to their homes under curfew, Abbas Milhem, director of the Palestinian Farmers’ Union (PAFU) in Ramallah said. His own family’s farm was among those targeted. Just over two weeks ago, armed Israeli settlers invaded the Milhem farm, fired guns in the direction of the people working on the harvest and stole olives. One of the workers at the farm, Iman Abdallah Jawabri, 45, was harvesting olives in a crew that included her husband when five settlers came in. “They shot towards us as if they wanted to scare us, then when they came closer, they took our phones to prevent us from taking photos of them. Then they told all the women to leave and started hitting the men, forcing them to sit on the ground under the olive trees. “We (the women) were still looking at them from afar. After this, they took all of our olives and forced us to leave.” The farm is now under military control despite being in Area B of the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority technically controls civilian matters. The Milhems and their workers have been unable to return. “The farmers are afraid of being shot if they do,” said Iman. “I have several grandchildren and fear for the future, but I also thank God for what we have and pray for the people of Gaza,” she added. “There is a second war in Palestine which is happening in the occupied West Bank,” said Milhem. “It is also crucial to understand how it affects farmers in the occupied West Bank.” He added that he cannot travel to visit his ageing mother in Jenin because Israeli forces have blocked many of the roads. “I am also afraid when my sons go out at night, and I call them constantly to see if they are OK,” he said. According to Human Rights Watch, Israeli security forces have killed more Palestinians in the occupied West Bank between January 1 and October 6 this year than in any year since 2005, when the United Nations began recording fatalities. This has raised Palestinian fears for their safety and the safety of their families, in addition to their fears for their livelihoods. Being unable to move around the West Bank to work since October 7 due to the vastly increased raids and curfews by Israeli forces and armed settlers means Palestinians are facing a crisis. According to the UN, poverty hasincreased by 20 percentand gross domestic product declined by 4.2 percent since October 7. Milhem said exports have completely stopped and nearly 50 percent of olives have not been harvested because of restrictions by the Israeli army on Palestinians’ movement. Another Palestinian farmer, Salah Awwad, 28, lost his home and land in Wadi Tahta in the south of the occupied West Bank in August. Settlers invaded his land, poured benzene around his property and set it on fire, destroying his beehives. They took over the land and Awwad was forced to flee with his family of eight children. After a few days, he said, he was able to retrieve his 100 sheep, but he can no longer return to the land. Since October 7, conditions at his new home in Sha’ab Tariq, 9km (5.6 miles) away, have worsened and now his livelihood is in the balance: he is not allowed to let his sheep graze, he told Al Jazeera. “The settlers are surrounding my home, and they are not letting me work,” he said. “I am afraid I might be shot, as they carry guns. What can I do? They have their weapons; I only have my hands.” Awwad added that, while life was difficult before the war began, prices have now risen sharply, particularly for farmers. The price of fodder for his sheep has risen by more than one-third since October 7. “No one is looking at us, only God,” he said. “But I will not move again, even if they try to force me.”",
Pho­tos: Lebanese res­i­dents of bor­der towns re­turn home amid truce in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/26/photos-lebanese-residents-of-border-towns-return-home-amid-truce-in-gaza,"In Pictures As a cautious calm descended on the border of south Lebanon on Saturday, the second day of a four-day ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, villages that had emptied of residents came back to life – at least briefly. Shuttered shops reopened, cars moved through the streets and, in one border town, a family on an outing posed for photos in front of brightly coloured block letters proclaiming, “I [HEART] ODAISSEH” – the town’s name About 55,500 Lebanese have been displaced by clashes between the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Israeli forces since the beginning of the war in Gaza, according to the International Organization for Migration. The fighting has killed more than 100 people in Lebanon, including more than a dozen civilians – three of them journalists – and 12 people on the Israeli side, including four civilians. While Lebanon and Hezbollah weren’t officially parties to the truce between Israel and Hamas, the pause has brought a halt to the daily exchanges of rockets, artillery shells and air strikes. Some Lebanese took the opportunity to inspect their damaged houses or to pick up belongings. Abdallah Quteish, a retired school principal, and his wife, Sabah, fled their house in the village of Houla – directly facing an Israeli military position across the border – on the second day of the clashes. They went to stay with their daughter in the north, leaving behind their olive orchard just as the harvest season was set to start. They returned to their house on Friday and to an orchard where the unharvested olives were turning dry on the branches. “We lost out on the season, but we’re all right … and that’s the most important thing,” Sabah said. “God willing, we’ll stay in our house if the situation remains like this.”",

The be­gin­ning of the end? The hy­po­thet­i­cal fu­ture of Pales­tin­ian pol­i­tics,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/28/the-beginning-of-the-end-the-hypothetical-future-of-palestinian-politics,"Could Hamas’s rival, the PA, return to rule Gaza? Would Palestinians even accept it? The masked Qassam Brigades fighter adjusts his AK-47 assault rifle before he slides into a chair in the Gaza office of Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas. “Hello, Condoleezza Rice. You have to deal with me now. There is no Abu Mazen [Abbas] any more,” the fighter jokes in an imaginary phone call to the then-United States secretary of state. Around him, fighters with the armed wing of Hamas snap photos of themselves. The year is 2007, andHamashas just fought and beaten a faction ofAbbas’s Fatah partyfor control of Gaza. Fatah lost the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections and was unhappy with the result, attacking the winners, Hamas. This spelled not only a political fracturing but also a geographical one. The Palestinians split into the occupied West Bank, partially governed by the PA, and Gaza under Hamas. The situation had remained frozen since then – until now when Palestinians’ political future seems more uncertain than ever. Israel’s stated objective for itscurrent bombardment and ground offensivein the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Hamas’s surprise attacks on October 7 in southern Israel has been to take out the armed group. If Israel is successful, the return of the PA to the beleaguered enclave is being touted as a possibility. But will it return? And can it? Under Hamas, the Gaza Strip has been besieged, impoverished by Israel and assaulted on five occasions in the past 17 years. In this latest assault, the Palestinian political future looks very precarious. Israel said it aims to destroy Hamas entirely and that is why it launched an all-out assault on the Gaza Strip on October 7. Israeli raids, settler violence and settlement expansionsin the occupied West Bankare among the reasons Hamas launched its attacks on October 7, Izzat al-Rasheq, a member of Hamas’s Political Bureau, said. “We warned the Israelis and the international community that this relentless pressure will result in an explosion, but they did not listen,” al-Rasheq told Al Jazeera, adding thatincursions on Al-Aqsa Mosque, thousands ofunjustly detained Palestinians, and theblockade on Gazaall played a role as well. In a scenario in which Israel succeeds in eliminating Hamas somehow, it has been suggested by the US that the PA take over the beleaguered enclave. So far, Israel does not agree, but what do the Palestinians think of the PA? Can it return to Gaza? And can Hamas be destroyed? The crux of the divide between the two most dominant players in Palestinian politics is their differing approaches to the Palestinian cause. While Fatah and the PA, whose current leadership is one and the same, focus on cooperation with Israel, Hamas’s strategy is to confront Israel militarily, said Aboud Hamayel, a lecturer at Birzeit University in the West Bank. “There’s nothing we can do,” Hamayel said, mimicking what he said is the PA’s defeatist tone. The PA’s support base in the West Bank is based on a transactional relationship with Israel, the analyst said. However, some Fatah factions do take part in the armed struggle in the West Bank, where the movement is more vocal and diverse than the PA, he added. Fatah still exists in Gaza, where it is now in the opposition. Its supporters there are split between loyalty to Abbas and former Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan, who has been in exile in the United Arab Emirates for 10 years, Hamayel said. The PA has international recognition and receives funding and tax revenues. In turn, it manages security in its territory, theoretically freeing Israel from dealing with day-to-day Palestinian life, Hamayel said, except when Israel conducts raids and arrests resisting Palestinians. Fatah does want to achieve unity with Hamas, according to the group’s spokesperson, even though several attempts over the years to do that have failed. “Through national dialogue, we will reach a consensus on how to govern ourselves, how to lead our cause and present it to the world,” Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson and a member of its parliamentary body, the Revolutionary Council, told Al Jazeera. A unified Palestinian entity is the stated US goal, especially as discussions arise on the fate of Gaza after the war, according to Kenneth Katzman, a senior fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center. This entity would control both Gaza and the West Bank, accept Israel’s existence and resume Oslo negotiations with Israel, he said, referring to agreements between Israel and the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the 1990s. “I think the intent is to get back to where the talks left off,” Katzman told Al Jazeera, adding that they would be the precursor to Washington mediating a two-state solution. Rafe Jabari, a French-Palestinian political science analyst, agreed that a two-state solution should be pursued after the war’s end but said a new agreement should be drawn up to replace the Oslo Accords because Palestinians were coerced to make too many concessions in that process. Israel will be unwilling to relinquish control of the lands it occupies, he added, and it will not be able to take out Hamas as it says it wants to. “Hamas is a part of Palestinian society. They can’t eliminate Hamas,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that they’re not just a political wing. Hamas agrees. “They cannot rearrange the Palestinian house to suit themselves. Hamas will remain, and what comes after Hamas will also be Hamas,” said al-Rasheq, adding that Palestinians would not accept “the US or Israel or anyone else” telling them who should govern them. “The Palestinian people will never accept an entity that enters Gaza on an Israeli tank,” he said. Because it is impossible to eradicate Hamas, Jabari said, the group will have to be involved in any post-war negotiations. “All actors should be involved in the resolution of the conflict,” he said, citing past negotiations in which that occurred even when one party was viewed as a “terrorist group”, such as during the French-Algeria peace agreement in 1962 or, more recently, intalks between the US and the Taliban. A transition period involving an international peacekeeping force in Gaza was mentioned by both Katzman and Jabari as a possible first step before negotiations. But, Jabari added, these forces have been abject failures in recent conflicts.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

Much of the frustration is with Abbas, who is seen as weak for not managing to advance any peace processes in his nearly two decades in power, Jabari said. He is also seen as not having advocated enough against Israel’s practices from settlement expansions to harassment of Palestinians, he added. PA security practicesin the occupied West Bank have also been criticised as heavy-handed but, Nazzal said, the PA needs to “restore order and protect the law”. “Movements of the Palestinian security forces or officials or normal individuals sometimes require security coordination with the occupying power,” he said, adding that everything the PA administers in the occupied West Bank “has to be coordinated with Israel”. Nazzal distanced Fatah from the PA, however, saying it is “a liberation movement that doesn’t have any sort of contact with Israel”. Despite frustration with the PA, Katzman said Palestinians who are bearing the brunt of the Israeli aggression may be more disgruntled with Hamas’s actions. “Much of the Gaza population now realises that Hamas is going to keep dragging them into a war with Israel, and they don’t want that,” he said. “So I think they’re willing to overlook the Palestinian Authority’s faults. I think that’s true for Palestinians in the West Bank as well. They don’t want … forever war with Israel.” However, al-Reshaq said: “Palestinians everywhere support Hamas more. They see Hamas is working to resist the occupation,” he said, adding that global support for Palestinians has surged in the past few weeks.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  With mixed support for the PA among Palestinians, what is the likelihood of it returning to govern Gaza? Nazzal pointed out that, despite Hamas rule, the PA already runs certain elements of life in Gaza, such as the health and education ministries and the banking system. Meanwhile, the Fatah movement, he added, is opposed to a future in which Hamas is taken out.“We do not agree on the Israeli military objectives in Gaza, nor can we predict what will be the outcome of this terrible assault that Israel has launched against our people,” Nazzal said. What Fatah knows, however, is that Palestinians should decide who governs them through legislative elections that secure a path for the two-state solution, he added. “The only thing that nobody has tried is for the Palestinians to live freely in an independent state of their own,” Nazzal said. “Until that happens, we will keep going from one cycle of violence to the next.” The US is still ramping up itspush for the return of the PA in Gaza, though, and the reasons President Joe Biden’s administration has for this strategy is multifold, Hamayel said. First is to buy time for Israel to finish its military operations by distracting the international community, he said. It wants to allow its ally to retaliate for Hamas’s October 7 attacks while coaxing it to think about what’s next, the analyst said. The White House also wants to keep its regional allies on side, especially as Arab states struggle with their citizens not feeling that they are doing enough to end the Israeli assault, according to Hamayel. However, he concluded, the PA takeover would happen only if Hamas loses, an outcome still too early to predict. Hamas, meanwhile, sees weakness in Israel’s seemingly directionless attack on civilians. “The size of the defeat [on October 7] made [Israel] lose its mind and strike out in any direction with no thought,” al-Reshaq said. “It has failed. It failed on the battlefield on October 7 when faced with the Qassam Brigades, and it is failing now because it is unable to achieve any real goals in Gaza.” In the event that Israel cannot take Hamas out, the fissure between the two Palestinian political groups will deepen, Hamayel predicted. Hamas would remain standing, a valiant hero for Palestinians for fighting Israel, and the PA would appear weak, shamed for cooperating with Israel over the years, he said. That would kick off a vicious cycle of a seemingly weak PA inspiring more settler activity in the West Bank, which would erode the group’s control of the territory more and more, he said. “This could be the beginning of the end of the PA,” Hamayel said.",Published On 28 Nov 2023
Gaza truce ap­pears set to ex­tend as Is­rael re­ceives new list of cap­tives,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/gaza-truce-appears-set-to-extend-as-israel-receives-new-list-of-captives,"A truce in the Israel-Hamas war appeared to be extending into a fifth day as the two sides completed theirfourth release of captives from Gazain exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails under an original four-day truce deal while mediators saidthe process would continue. Qatar, which along with Egypt has facilitated indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, said that there was an agreement to extend by two days the original four-day truce that was to expire on Monday. “We have an extension … two more days,” Qatar’s Ambassador to the United Nations Alya Ahmed Saif Al-Thani told reporters after a closed-door UN Security Council meeting on Monday, saying both sides were to release more people. “This is a very positive step,” Al-Thani said. While the Israeli government had yet to officially confirm the truce extension by early on Tuesday morning, Israel’s Army Radio, citing the prime minister’s office, reported that a new list of captives – who are expected to be released later in the day – had been received. Israel has said it would extend the ceasefire by one day for every 10 additional captives released by Hamas. Local news website Axios reported the latest list contained the names of 10 Israeli captives. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli prime minister’s office. Israel on Monday said 11 Israelis had been returned to the country from the Gaza Strip, bringing to 69 the total number of Israeli and foreign captives released by Hamas since Friday under the truce.

The Israel Prison Service said 33 Palestinian prisoners were also released on Monday from Israel’s Ofer prison in the West Bank and from a detention centre in Jerusalem, bringing the total number of Palestinians it has freed since Friday to 150. The freed Palestinian prisoners were greeted by loud cheers as the Red Cross bus they were travelling in made its way through the streets of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. The original truce agreement also allowed more aid trucks into Gaza, where the civilian population faces shortages of food, fuel, drinking water and medicine. While describing the extension of the truce as “a glimpse of hope and humanity”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said two more days was not enough time to meet Gaza’s aid needs. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said in a report on Monday that the four-day pause in hostilities had allowed humanitarian aid groups, particularly Red Crescent workers, to provide assistance to peoplein desperate need throughout Gazawhere 1.8 million people are internally displaced. More than 14,800 people have been killed in Gaza – including some 10,000 women and children – since Israel launched its attacks on the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 7 raid on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s intense bombing of the densely populated Gaza Strip has also resulted in 46,000 homes destroyed and more than 234,000 damaged –about 60 percent of the entire housing stock in Gaza, the UN said in the report. Despite the apparent extension of the truce for two additional days, Israel remains committed to crushing Hamas militarily and has warned that its war on Gaza will resume. Resumption will likely see Israeli forces expand their air, land and sea offensive from the devastated northern Gaza to the south of the enclave where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled seeking refuge.",Published On 28 Nov 2023
"Trau­ma, stress and sor­row ‘take root’ in Gaza af­ter weeks of Is­rael bomb­ing",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/28/israel-hamas-war-live-33-more-palestinian-prisoners-released-by-israel,"We’re getting media reports of senior US officials saying Israel was told by the Biden administration it must work to avoid “significant further displacement” of Palestinians in southern Gaza if it renews its military campaign after the truce. The US officials, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said the US government sought to avoid more civilian causalities or mass displacements seen before the truce began on Friday. The White House has begun putting more pressure on Israel to ensure that their future offensive must be “carefully thought through”. Responding to reports of Israeli officials threatening to target Hamas officials in Qatar, Majed al-Ansari, the Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson said, “There is something called international law”. “To the respect to the statement made by the prime minister about targeting and assassinating Hamas leaders in Qatar, there is something called international law. I cannot comment on these statements; there are many erratic statements [made] related to domestic affairs, and not only in Israel. “Qatar is adamant to continue the mediation efforts regardless of these statements,” he said. Save the Children says the international community’s failure to agree on a ceasefire is “costing thousands of lives”. With the UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday and the extended truce ending the following morning, the charity said in a statement that without a complete ceasefire, “Gaza’s children are left to live through a nightmare once again”. “How many lives have to be lost – from children, civilians, humanitarian staff – before the international community steps up and fulfils its legal, diplomatic and moral obligations to keep civilians safe from the clutches of conflict?” said Jason Lee, Save the Children country director in the occupied Palestinian territory. “The international community must stop standing by while children’s rights continue to be egregiously violated. The cost of inaction is the destruction of children’s lives and robbing them of their futures,” Lee added. Some 15,000 people in Gaza have been killed in Israeli bombardment, including more than 6,000 children. The World Health Organization warns that more people risk dying from diseases than from bombings in Gaza if the enclave’s health system is not put back on its feet quickly. “Eventually we will see more people dying from disease than from bombardment if we are not able to put back together this health system,” spokesperson Margaret Harris said. She described the collapse of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City as a “tragedy” and voiced concern about the detention of some of its medical staff by Israeli forces. Last week, the Israeli armyarrestedthe hospital’s director Muhammad Abu Salmiya and other senior doctors.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

Let’s bring you up to speed with the latest developments: Qatar is focused on further extending the truce between Hamas and Israel beyond tomorrow based on the group’s ability to continue releasing 10 captives daily, Majed al-Ansari says. “The priority at this moment is civilian women and children” to be released, adding that “military men will come into discussion” after that, the Qatari official says. Answering a question about whether Hamas will be part of the electoral process in the post-war era in Gaza, al-Ansari said: “With respect to the union among the Palestinian factions, this is domestic affairs of the Palestinians and should be addressed by them. However, we are not sparing any efforts to bring all the factions of the Palestinian people on one front.” Al-Ansari adds that Qatar cannot confirm the total number of captives held in Gaza. “What we can only say with certainty is the number of captives being released.” Majed al-Ansari, the Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson, says Israel was the “toughest party” in the negotiations process. “The negotiations process is difficult from all aspects,” he told a media briefing in Doha. “Each party has its own demands and reservations. We’re doing our best to sort things out. But the toughest party was Israel.”   ",Published On 28 Nov 2023
US rights ad­vo­cates launch hunger strike for Is­rael-Hamas cease­fire,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/us-rights-advocates-launch-hunger-strike-for-israel-hamas-ceasefire,"Actor Cynthia Nixon joins activists and state legislators outside the White House in a protest against the US’s backing of the Gaza war. Washington, DC –State lawmakers and Palestinian rights supporters, joined by actor and progressive advocate Cynthia Nixon, have launched a five-day hunger strike outside the White House to demand aceasefire in Gaza. At a news conference on Monday, the activists decried United States President Joe Biden’s role in supporting the Israeli offensive in Gaza and called for an immediate end to the fighting. The hunger strike adds to thegrowing demandfor a ceasefire from activists, artists and politicians, as well as staff members working in theUS government. But Biden has so far resisted such calls, voicing unwavering support for Israel. Biden has also pledged more than $14bn in additional US aid to Israel — funds that advocates say are contributing to the Israeli violence. The protesters at Monday’s event stressed that public opinion polls show that most Americans back a ceasefire. They also underscored the scale of the destruction in Gaza, where more than 14,800 Palestinians have died. United Nations experts have warned that the conflict puts Palestinians “at grave risk of genocide“. “How many more Palestinians must be killed before you call for a ceasefire, President Biden? We cannot wait any longer,” said Iman Abid, an organiser with the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR). Israel and Hamas declared a four-day truce in the conflict last week, and on Monday, officials announced the pause in fighting would continue for two additional days, to allow for the release of more Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners. The hunger-strikers said that the continued pause demonstrates that diplomacy — not bombs — can solve the crisis in Gaza. Israeli leaders, however, have suggested that theywill resumethe bombing with more intensity once the truce expires. They have also warned residents from northern Gaza against returning to their homes. “The area north of the Gaza Strip is a combat zone, and it is forbidden to stay there,” Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said last week. This week’s hunger strike in Washington, DC, is organised by Palestine solidarity advocates, progressive Jewish groups as well as Arab and Palestinian-American organisations. Here’s what some of the hunger-strikers at the White House had to say: Today we begin a hunger strike in front of the White House demanding a permanent ceasefire.pic.twitter.com/BChpnSJX7z — Sumaya Awad (@sumayaawad)November 27, 2023  Best known for her work in the TV series Sex and the City and her run in the 2018 New York governor’s race, Nixon used her speech at Monday’s event to highlight the carnage in Gaza, including the killings of dozens of journalists and UN workers as well as the destruction ofentire neighbourhoods. “Our president’s seeming disregard for the incredible human toll Israel’sfar-right governmentis exacting on innocent civilians does not remotely reflect the desire of the overwhelming majority of Americans,” she said. “And I would like to make a personal plea to a president — who has himself experienced such devastatingpersonal loss— to connect with that empathy for which he is so well-known and to look at the children of Gaza and imagine that they were his children. “We implore him that this current ceasefire must continue, and we must build off it to begin to negotiate a more permanent peace. We cannot keep letting American tax dollars aid and abet the killing and starvation of millions of Palestinians. ‘Never again’ means never again — for anyone.” Wilson-Anton, a Muslim American legislator from Biden’s home state of Delaware, said that while she is anxious about abstaining from food for several days, her thoughts are with the people of Gaza who are experiencing a massacre with no choice or end in sight. “The majority ofAmericansare for a permanent ceasefire. And it’s unfortunate that our president and our congressional members are not being responsive to what’s important to Delawareans and Americans from all states,” Wilson-Anton, a Democrat, said. “And so I’m hoping that, this week, we’ll be successful in gaining the ear of our president and of our congressional members, so they can actually start to use their privilege and position to negotiate a ceasefire that is lasting.” Mamdani hailed the release of Israelis held by Hamas and Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during the truce. “We are hunger striking for a world where everyone is with their family. And it is a world that can only be made possible through a ceasefire. It is not war that brought us these reunifications. It is negotiations; it is a cessation [of hostilities],” he said. “We hunger-strike not because we want to. We hunger-strike because we have been forced by this president and by our government’s foreign policy. We hunger-strike because Palestinianshave been doubtedin life and death, and their experience has been erased.” Abdelhamid, a New York organiser, linked the killing of Palestinians in Gaza to a rise in prejudice against Arabs and Muslims in the US. She pointed to Saturday’s shooting of threePalestinian studentsin a suspected hate crime as an example. “As someone who has been organising against hate-based violence across this country, I’m fully aware that the violence and the anti-Palestinian rhetoric that we’re seeing abroad is also impacting us here in the United States. Those two things are inextricably linked,” Abdelhamid said. “When our elected [officials] and our politicians and our representatives are continuously dehumanising Palestinian people, are normalising Palestinian deaths, we get what we got two days ago. We get three Palestinian students in Vermont being shot for simplywearing a keffiyeh, for simply speaking Arabic.”  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

I’m an American and I’m a mother of a 16-month-old, and I’m on hunger strike to illustrate to our government just a sliver, a fragment of what Palestinians are enduring in Gaza every single day,” Awad said. “I am on hunger strike to demand a permanent ceasefire and to say that we will continue to pressure our government in every way possible to get that permanent ceasefire because we are not just silent observers. We are complicit in what is happening in Palestine. “We are on hunger strike because what’s happening in Gaza is not something far away that we have nothing to do with. It has real impacts on our lives here in the US.”",Published On 27 Nov 2023

Over the past several days, Palestinian groups in Gaza have released captives in exchange for the release of Palestinians held inIsraeli prisons, many of whom are women and children who have been held without trial.

The United States has said that a group of attackers whotried to seizean Israel-linked cargo ship over the weekend were probably Somali pirates rather than Houthi fighters from nearby Yemen. Speaking on Monday, Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Patrick Ryder noted that the US has not ruled out a Houthi connection to the attempted hijacking by five armed men over the weekend. “We’re continuing to assess, but initial indications that these five individuals are Somali,” said Ryder. “Clearly a piracy-related incident,” he added.

"‘We want per­ma­nent cease­fire,’ Pales­tini­ans in Gaza say as truce ex­tend­ed",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/27/we-want-permanent-ceasefire-palestinians-in-gaza-say-as-truce-extended,"The four-day humanitarian pause has quietened the skies over Gaza but has shone a light on the suffering of displaced Palestinians. Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip –Ayman Harb, a father of three children, stuck it out with his family in theGaza City neighbourhoodof Shujayea for more than a month of the war, even as Israeli bombs and tanks destroyed the besieged enclave’s largest urban centre. Last week, just before a four-day humanitarian pause came into effect, he decided the family had to flee. One of his sons has cerebral palsy and requires an oxygen tank, and the Israeli soldiers threatened to shoot Harb if he did not throw away the oxygen. Now in central Gaza, Harb has but one dream — for the truce to turn into a full-fledged ceasefire that allows him and his family to return home. On Monday evening as the four-day truce was coming to an end, Qatar, which has played a central role in mediating talks that enabled the pause in fighting, announced that the halt in the war had been extended by another two days. For families across Gaza, thatbrief respitealso serves to underscore the suffering and humiliation of the enclave’s 2.3 million people, who have been under attack since October 7. Palestinians are calling for a permanent ceasefire, stressing that their priority is to return to their homes even if they were destroyed in the heavy bombardment over the past month and a half. The truce, which began on Friday, has seen the release of Israeli civilian captives held by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel. It has quietened the skies over the Gaza Strip from the incessant sound of Israeli drones and warplanes. But it has done little to ease the collective trauma of the people of Gaza. According to the United Nations, 1.6 million people have been displaced from their homes, many forced to flee to the south of the strip. Some families who have tried to return to the north during the truce have been fired upon by Israeli snipers. Others have been forced to live in what they describe as “shame”. “I’ve been here staying in a tent on the grounds of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital for a week, right next to the ambulances,” 41-year-old Harb said. “We are about 20 people in one tent, but I had to send my wife and my other two children to stay with a relative after the rain soaked our tent this morning.” “Yes, the bombings have stopped, but we need a truce that will return us to our homes,” he added. “Otherwise, there is no point in one. I’d rather go back to my home and die there than stay here in a tent living in shame and being forced to rely on people for the basic necessities of life.” Harb said his family had to beg before in their lives. Now they are desperate for medicine, food and water. “We don’t want war. We just want to live in our homes with our dignity intact,” his 20-year-old cousin Badr said. Imm Shadi al-Taher, a 63-year-old mother of 10, was displaced from her home in Tall az-Zaatar in Gaza City three weeks ago. She has also been staying with 25 members of her family in one tent on the hospital grounds. “We had our pride and dignity, but look at the state we are in now, this destitution and the fact that no one is looking to help us or is thinking of us,” she said. She acknowledged the“huge relief”of not hearing the sound of drones, warplanes or artillery shelling, noting that her grandchildren are more relaxed, but she cannot bear to stay away from her home, which was destroyed. “I’m willing to live in a tent but on the ruins of my home, where I don’t need to ask anyone for help,” she said. “I want to go back to bury my siblings who are still under the rubble of their own destroyed homes.” According to the Gaza media government office, at least 6,800 people are missing and presumed dead under the rubble. This is in addition to the 14,854 Palestinians killed since October 7, the majority of them women and children. For Noor Saadeh, a 23-year-old mother of two who was displaced from her home in Gaza City a month ago, the truce is not enough. “What’s the point of a truce if we cannot go back to our homes?” she asked. “My son keeps telling me he misses his friends at nursery school. We want our old life back.” She is worried about the onset of winter since she and her family fled while it was still warm and have no way to go back to their home. “I had to ask people for appropriate clothes for the children at the very least,”  she said. “We didn’t think we would be here for this long.”",Published On 27 Nov 2023

Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas official, said he hoped the truce could be extended further. “It [the possibility of an extension] was written in the agreement, that if Hamas gives more hostages, there will be more days of the ceasefire,” he told Al Jazeera. “We have now agreed to release more hostages and extend the agreement for two days. This is good news for our people, especially the people of Gaza. “I hope we can extend it until we reach the end of this war. We want to end the war. We are in a temporary ceasefire, but we are trying to extend it. There is lots of support from Qatar, Egypt and many Western governments to end this catastrophe,” he said. During the first three days of the truce, 39 Israeli captives werereleased by the armed groupin exchange for 117 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. As a result of parallel negotiations led by Qatar, 17 Thai citizens, one Filipino and one dual Russian-Israeli national have also been released by Hamas.  This is a modal window.

Hamas fighters seized about 240 hostages when they stormed from Gaza into southern Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. After the attack, Israel launched a relentless bombing campaign and a ground offensive in Gaza, killing nearly 15,000 people, including more than 6,000 children, according to Palestinian officials. Reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim said families across the occupied Palestinian territories would be relieved by the extension. “This is a source of relief for many families, not just the families of prisoners, but also other people in the occupied West Bank who are watching in horror images coming out of the besieged Gaza Strip. “We are not just referring to the killings and children who’ve lost their lives but also to the people who have been displaced, to the wounded, to the many hungry and in a very difficult situation.”  This is a modal window.

The White House welcomed the extension of the truce and said it hopes Americans would be among the captives to be released in the next phase of exchanges. Eight to nine US citizens are believed to still be among those held. The United Nations chief also hailed the two-day extension as a “glimpse of hope and humanity” but warned it was not enough time to meet the aid needs of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. “I strongly hope that this will enable us to increase even more the humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza that [are] suffering so much – knowing that even with that additional amount of time, it will be impossible to satisfy all the dramatic needs of the population,” Guterres told reporters. The extension was announced as Hamas said it had received a list with the names of prisoners to be released later on Monday in exchange for Israeli captives, the group said on its Telegram channel. The list includes three female prisoners and another 30 children. Meanwhile, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had informed families of the identities of the captives to be released on Monday.  This is a modal window.

"Emp­ty towns to sea laun­dry: How war has changed Is­rael, Pales­tine",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/27/photos-empty-towns-to-sea-laundry-how-war-has-changed-israel-palestine,"In Pictures On October 7, Hamas launched deadly attacks on southern Israel, prompting a relentless aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip and a subsequent ground offensive by Israel that has killed nearly 15,000 Palestinians. The war has changed the lives of people all across the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel, a26,790sq-km(10,345sq-mile) area similar in size to Haiti (27,750sq km/10,715sq miles) or Albania (28,748sq km/11,100sq miles). What has changed, however, varies dramatically from place to place. In Israel’s north near the border with Lebanon, sporadic shelling occurs throughout the day, and most locals have been evacuated as tensions with Hezbollah rise. The locals who remain live in near ghost towns and are often heavily armed. Those who have been displaced also include the residents of the kibbutzim and towns in southern Israel near Gaza. They have been moved into hotels, often in scenic seaside locations. Five-star hotels along the Dead Sea coast no longer exude a sense of luxury as families spread out in common areas, children playing loudly in their new temporary homes. The seaside resorts in Israel’s southern city of Eilat by the Red Sea and sandwiched between Jordan and Egypt have also been filled with Israeli families from near the Gaza border. The city has been the subject of missile attacks from Houthi fighters in Yemen. Israeli warplanes roar over beach bars and fancy restaurants as they scramble to deal with the threat over the sun-drenched Gulf of Aqaba. In the occupied West Bank, Israeli raids have killed more than 200 Palestinians while Palestinians living in occupied East Jerusalem have faced regular harassment by police and the Israeli military since October 7. Palestinians there speak of a “collective punishment”, in which Israeli authorities are targeting the Palestinian community for the Hamas attacks, which killed 1,200 people. At times, there is some commonality to the experience of life at war. At other times, there is profound contrast, from the images of families in Gaza without access to clean waterforced to wash in polluted seawaterto volleyball matches and sunbathers farther up the coast on Tel Aviv’s popular beachfront. In Gaza, the bombardments have left swathes of the besieged enclave in ruins. In cities across Israel, regular rocket attacks are largely intercepted by the Iron Dome system. Some people choose to take shelter, and others go about their daily business. And then, at other times, the different experiences are less visible but no less deep: Scratch beneath the surface and the tensions are palpable. Palestinians living in Israel can go about their daily lives but speak privately of being silenced, unable to express solidarity or even sympathy for the people of Gaza. Here is a snapshot of life at war.",Published On 27 Nov 2023
‘Our only out­let’: Pales­tini­ans in Gaza go to the beach dur­ing Is­rael truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/27/palestinians-in-gaza-go-to-the-beach,"In Pictures Central Gaza Strip –As the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas holds for what may be its final day, many of the displaced Palestinians staying in the town of Deir el-Balah have taken advantage of the lull in Israeli bombings and made their way to the Mediterranean Sea. On the shore, boys heap sand over their bodies, racing to see who finishes first. Some of the children are taking turns on the swings, their first expression of childhood in nearly two months. As the waves crash to shore and recede, Ahmad al-Toum breathes in the breeze, his shoulders relaxing. “The sea means a lot to me,” he said. “It’s a great release for everyone who felt pent up and surrounded by the psychological pressures of not being able to provide safety and security for their own family.” The 28-year-old from the coastal town of al-Sudaniyeh, in northwest Gaza, has been displaced since October 10, staying with his extended family in a United Nations-run school. “People who live by the sea know it more than their own homes,” he said. Al-Toum hasn’t showered in 20 days and is grateful to escape the “disease and dirtiness” of the school shelter. “I wanted to take the kids for a change of scenery, to wash them in the sea, to get out of the psychology of war,” he said. “Running into the sea, yelling, screaming – letting it all out so that one can have the energy to keep on persevering. “It’s been such a terrible time, but we are stronger than the Israeli occupation,” he said. After Hamas’s surprise October 7 attack on Israeli towns and army bases in southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people, Israel launched its most devastating attacks yet on the Gaza Strip. Over the course of more than 50 days, Israeli forces have killed more than 14,800 people, including 6,150 children. More than 7,000 others – including 4,700 women and children – are missing, presumed dead under the rubble of their own homes. According to Salama Marouf, the head of the government media office in Gaza, Israel dropped 40,000 tonnes of explosives on the strip. Abu Anas, who is from the northern town of Beit Hanoon, describes the sea as “our outlet, our only escape”. “We came here for our children, to change their moods and lift their spirits because they have been living in fear and anxiety with the non-stop sounds of artillery shelling and bombs,” the 35-year-old said. “We don’t know if the war will resume … we just want to breathe a bit.”",Published On 27 Nov 2023
Grief to courage: A Pales­tin­ian strand­ed in Egypt as Is­rael bombs Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/27/grief-to-courage-a-palestinian-stranded-in-egypt-as-israel-bombs-gaza,"Mohammed Kafarna spoke to Al Jazeera over two months of being trapped in Egypt, despairing as friends died, family fled. “Hello, I’m Mohammed… of the family Kafarna. I am 24 years old and a law graduate from Al-Azhar University in Gaza. I live in the city of Beit Hanoon, adjacent to the apartheid wall that the Israeli occupation built. I lost 15 people from my family. I lost two friends, we grew up with each other too.” For most young people, being 24 means entering the workforce, enrolling in grad school or moving cities. But for Mohammed Kafarna, a Palestinian lawyer marooned in Egypt, 24 means watching helplessly as his family and friends in Gaza are slaughtered. This is his story as told to Al Jazeera through conversations, messages and voice notes. At the beginning of October, Mohammed went to Egypt for eye surgery he could not get in Gaza. He was not travelling for pleasure, but wanted to make the most of his journey, writing on social media that he didn’t want to go home before seeing the “beautiful places in Egypt”. Mohammed wears glasses so he can see. In photos with his university friend Amjad al-Athamneh – who has since been killed in a bombing – his laugh lines reach all the way to their rounded frames. Mohammed was amonghundredsof Palestinians who were in Egypt for medical treatment on October 7. So far, not one has made it back into Gaza. On October 4, Mohammed joked about taking photos of his travel buddies, saying his friends never took his picture. “The worst thing in life,” he said playfully. Like many young people, he once delighted in sharing lighthearted pictures of himself on social media. He could never have predicted the turn his life would take. On October 9, Mohammed’s cousin Suhail was transferring money for Mohammed’s surgery when anIsraeli air attacktargeted the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. Suhail was killed at the money exchange. “We shared everything since childhood. I couldn’t bear the news. I went into shock for three days.” Mohammed spiralled into a bottomless pit after Suhail’s death, whom he described as a brother. He could not pull himself out of bed. Cut off from his family in Gaza, Mohammed had not had the surgery yet, and his ability to see took a backseat as he refused to have anyone else meet the same fate as Suhail to transfer money. On October 12, the house belonging to Maryam, Mohammed’s sister, was bombed in Beit Hanoon. Her husband Ali and his entire extended family were killed. Maryam, who was flung 50 metres (164 feet) by the force of the explosion, and her two daughters survived. One of Mohammed’s friends got a message to him from Gaza, breaking the news of his brother-in-law’s death. He reassured Mohammed that his sister and nieces were alive – for now. “After their home was bombed, they were displaced to the south of the Gaza Strip and were targeted again,” said Mohammed, his voice hollow. Maryam was able to receive several vital surgeries but some of the care she needs will have to wait “due to the lack of medicines and treatment in Gaza”. Her daughter Nihad suffered serious injuries and burns to her face while her daughter Sham’s left hand was fractured. Hospitals in Gaza are so damaged and out of supplies that they cannot offer care. Several have shut down. Stranded in Egypt, Mohammed was tormented by his sister and nieces’ suffering. Not only was he watching his family’s pain but he had to confront the possibility that he might become the only one left to remember them. He wanted the rest of the world to know what hospitals have had to do in Gaza, that some operations were done without anaesthesia because there just isn’t any. So he went online to share atrocities being committed in Gaza. “We do not want to die and be remembered as if we were just numbers. Each of us has a dream and a future that he was drawing in his imagination.” His cousin Suhail’s dream was to raise enough money to build his own house. “Today I reached out to my mother. I wasn’t able to contact her for five days… she told me they drank the contaminated water.” His mother cried from hunger on the phone call, and Mohammed felt utterly helpless. How could he keep his family from starving while stuck in Cairo? He appealed on social media for someone in Deir el-Balah to help his family. “I just need someone to help me,” Mohammed pleaded. “[My family] need gas to be able to make bread…” Israel’s siege on Gaza forced Palestinians there to ration food and drink noxious water, conditions that have worsened life in what rights groups have for years called an “open-air prison”. Hopelessness threatened to overwhelm Mohammed. The world had turned its back on thousands of innocents. “Israel is committing genocide and ethnic cleansing,” Mohammed said. “We must… stop this.” On October 25, Ahmed Musa Shabat, another university friend of Mohammed’s, went to a bakery in southern Gaza hoping to buy bread for his family. They had just fled south from Beit Hanoon. Victory Bakery fed the whole region, according to Mohammed, and he believes it was targeted, along with the people buying bread. Ahmed and his cousin were killed. There were attacks even on the southern areas to where the Israeli armytoldcivilians to flee. Those who headed south are still being slaughtered. “Everything was one shock after another for me,” Mohammed disclosed with some difficulty. The number of deaths he was bombarded with over the past weeks had taken a toll on his mental state. The same day Ahmed was killed, Mohammed heard that his cousin Muhammad and his young son Bassem had been killed in a bombing. Bassem was beheaded. “His head is still under the rubble,” said Mohammed. Mohammed’s tone had grown weary. Hours earlier, he heard news that his friend Ibrahim’s entire family had been killed. Ibrahim survived but is still in critical condition in an intensive care unit after a near-fatal head injury. Mohammed still hadn’t gotten the eye surgery but his thoughts were now entirely on his friend Ibrahim, who he still has hope for. “Pray for Ibrahim,” Mohammed implored. “And let the world know that the massacres have not stopped.” He wants to use his unforeseen position as a Palestinian in Egypt to raise awareness about the desperate situation in Gaza. He appealed to the world to expose the human rights violations in Gaza, in Palestine. “When will you take action to stop the massacres?” Mohammed challenged the international community. “Your silence kills us more than their missiles.” Mohammed made contact with his mother for the first time in 10 days. When his family fled their home in early October, they did not know to bring clothes for the arduous month that lay ahead. His young nieces, he said, were shivering in the rain in the displacement camps. Since he heard about the ceasefire, Mohammed has longed to see his mother and sister, but his mother warned him not to try to cross the border. “You’d just be a burden on us here,” she told Mohammed. “There is no good water, no electricity, and no food.” “She told me to stay out and try to find work so that I can help them after the end of this aggression because we’ve seen life after the war before.” Mohammed recounted his family being without electricity for more than a year, carrying water by hand for more than 10km (6.2 miles) or sleeping in frigid homes without doors and windows. In Cairo, Egyptian landlords are hostile towards him and many displaced Palestinians who struggle to pay rent, according to Mohammed. He managed to find housing after scouring social media but others were not as lucky. Even if those in Gaza were able to send money to their relatives abroad, those who fled Israeli air raids have no income. When Mohammed’s family left the house, they brought no more than $150, which “ran out after the seventh day of the war”. Mohammed sketched out an old dream of his – to complete his law studies at Cairo University, specialising in international humanitarian law. “This is what I dreamed of since my childhood, to represent my country and my cause in international forums, and to convey to the world the correct narrative of the Palestinian issue.” Palestinians, Mohammed said, love life and have dreams and ambitions. “They want to live in peace without fighting, killing, displacement.” But after what he has experienced from afar in recent weeks, Mohammed is losing hope. “I’ve been disappointed in my childhood dream,” he said. “I have a feeling that my law degree will be torn up. Why do we study laws and rights if we cannot protect them?” He pleaded hopelessly. “What is the benefit of adopting laws and agreements if we do not see their effectiveness in Gaza?” “Do the children of Gaza not deserve security and peace like the rest of the world?”",Published On 27 Nov 2023
Elon Musk meets Ne­tanyahu dur­ing Is­rael vis­it,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/elon-musk-arrives-in-israel-flight-tracker,"The tech billionaire has voiced support for Israel’s war against Hamas as he faces accusations of anti-Semitism. Tech billionaire Elon Musk has met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, touring a kibbutz targeted by Palestinian gunmen during an October 7 attack and expressing support for Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The visit comes amid a period of controversy for Musk, who recentlysparked outrageby calling an anti-Semitic social media post – one promoting the conspiracy theory that white people in the West are being “replaced” through immigration from the Global South with the help of progressive Jews – “the actual truth”. After touring the decimated kibbutz ofKfar Azawith Netanyahu, Musk said in a conversation with the prime minister on X Spaces that it was “jarring to see the scene of the massacre” and that Israel has “no choice” but to eliminate Hamas. The trip comes on the fourth day of an ongoing truce between Israel and Hamas, during which Israel is recovering dozens of captives in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. סיירתי עם אילון מאסק בקיבוץ כפר עזה כדי להראות לו מקרוב את הפשעים נגד האנושות שביצע חמאס@elonmusk (צילום: עמוס בן גרשום, לע״מ)pic.twitter.com/aipX6ryv7T — Benjamin Netanyahu – בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu)November 27, 2023  Musk is also scheduled to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose office said in a statement that the meeting would underscore “the need to act to combat rising antisemitism online”. Under Musk’s tenure, critics have said that the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has seen a proliferation of hate speech and anti-Semitism content, and several companies suspended advertising on the platform after a report accused X of running their ads alongside content from neo-Nazis and white nationalists. X Corp is currently suing non-profit Media Matters on the grounds that it has driven away advertisers by portraying the site as rife with anti-Semitic content. Musk has also threatened to file suit against the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish advocacy group, over its claims that problematic and racist speech has soared on the site since he completed his $44bn takeover. As Musk arrived, Israel announced it had struck an agreement “in principle” to use SpaceX’s Starlink communications channel in Gaza, where Musk had previously suggested it could be utilised to enhance communications. The agreement marked a major shift for Israel, whose communication minister previously dismissed the idea of opening up Starlink to Gaza because it said Hamas would use it for “terrorist activities”. But on Monday, Israeli Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi announced Israel had reached an agreement in principle under which “Starlink satellite units can only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications, including the Gaza Strip”. In an X post addressed to Musk, Karhi said he hoped the entrepreneur’s visit to Israel “will serve as a springboard for future endeavors, as well as enhance your relationship with the Jewish people and values we share with the entire world”.

However, critics say it has also amplified misinformation, conspiracy theories, and hateful content, including anti-Semitism, during the conflict. Following the outbreak of the Gaza war on October 7, anti-Semitism incidents in the United States rose by nearly 400 percent from the year-earlier period, according to the ADL. The Council on American-Islamic Relations reported a 216 percent increase in Islamophobic and anti-Arab incidents between October 7 and November 4.",Published On 27 Nov 2023

Police in the city of Burlington arrested the 48-year-old suspect, identified as Jason J Eaton, on Sunday afternoon, according to US news reports. The three victims, Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ahmed, were shot on Saturday evening near the University of Vermont’s campus. The students, who attend different universities in the US, remain hospitalised with gunshot wounds. The students, two of whom are American citizens and the third a legal resident, were visiting Burlington to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with families.  As more details of the attack emerge, police say they are investigating the shooting as a hate crime. “In this charged moment, no one can look at this incident and not suspect that it may have been a hate-motivated crime,” Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad said in a statement. “That there is an indication that this shooting could have been motivated by hate is chilling, and this possibility is being prioritised” by police, Mayor Miro Weinberger said. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) stated that upon learning of the details of the shooting, the organisation had “reason to believe [it] was motivated by the three victims being Arab”. “According to the information provided, the three victims were wearing a keffiyeh and speaking Arabic. A man shouted and harassed the victims, then proceeded to shoot them,” the group said in a statement. This morning, ADC was contacted about the shooting, after reviewing the information, we have reason to believe that the shooting was motivated by the three vitims being Arab.

The incident came amid arise in anti-Palestinian sentimentin the US, with both Republican and Democratic politicians backing Israel’swar in Gaza, despite the mounting Palestinian death toll and growing accusations of war crimes. “The surge in anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian sentiment we are experiencing is unprecedented, and this is another example of that hate turning violent,” Ayoub said. The victims’ families issued a joint statement urging authorities to investigate the shooting as a hate crime. “We need to ensure that our children are protected, and this heinous crime is not repeated. No family should ever have to endure this pain and agony,” they said. Six-year-old Palestinian-American Wadea Al-Fayoume was killed when he was stabbed 26 times by his landlord in a suspected hate crime in the US state of Illinois last month. Israel’s ground and air assault on the besieged Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, and left vast swathes of the enclave in ruins.

A brief his­to­ry of Is­rael-Pales­tine con­flict in 10 maps,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/palestine-and-israel-brief-history-maps-and-charts,"As Gaza reels from Israel’s devastating bombardments, here’s a brief history of the conflict using maps and charts. Israel’s deadly bombardment of Gaza has killed nearly 15,000 people, including 10,000 women and children, in over 50 days, making it the deadliest war for the besieged Palestinian enclave till date. Israel has rebuffed calls for a ceasefire as a four-day humanitarian truce comes to an end on November 28. It is unclear whether the truce will be extended. The devastation of Gaza and the mounting death toll has triggered worldwide protests, bringing the decades-long issue to the centre-stage of global politics. The Israeli-Palestinian issue goes back nearly a century when Britain, during World War I, pledged to establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine under theBalfour Declaration. British troops took control of the territory from the Ottoman Empire at the end of October 1917.  A large-scale Jewish migration to Palestine began, accelerated by Jewish people fleeing Nazism in Europe. Between 1918 and 1947, the Jewish population in Palestine increased from 6 percent to 33 percent. Palestinians were alarmed by the demographic change and tensions rose, leading to thePalestinian revoltfrom 1936 to 1939. Meanwhile, Zionist organisations continued to campaign for a homeland for Jews in Palestine. Armed Zionist militias started to attack the Palestinian people, forcing them to flee. Zionism, which emerged as a political ideology in the late 19th century, called for the creation of a Jewish homeland.  As violence ravaged Palestine, the matter was referred to the newly formed United Nations. In 1947, the UN adopted Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, handing over about55 percentof the land to Jews. Arabs were granted 45 percent of the land, while Jerusalem was declared a separate internationalised territory.  The city is currently divided between West Jerusalem, which is predominantly Jewish, and East Jerusalem with a majority Palestinian population. Israel captured East Jerusalem after the Six-Day War in 1967 along with the West Bank – a step not recognised by the international community. The Old City in occupied East Jerusalem holds religious significance for Christians, Muslims, and Jews. It is home to Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which is known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as Temple Mount. In 1981, the UN designated it a World Heritage Site.  Leading up to Israel’s birth in 1948, more than 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homes by Zionist militias. This mass exodus came to be known as theNakbaor catastrophe. A further 300,000 Palestinians weredisplacedby theSix-Day War in 1967.   Israel declared the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980, but the international community still considers it an occupied territory. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. In 1993, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed theOslo Accords, which aimed to achieve peace within five years. It was the first time the two sides recognised each other. A second agreement in 1995 divided the occupied West Bank into three parts – Area A, B and C. The Palestinian Authority, which was created in the wake of the Oslo Accords, was offered only limited rule on 18 percent of the land as Israel effectively continued to control the West Bank.  However, the Oslo Accords slowly broke down asIsraeli settlements, Jewish communities built on Palestinian land in the West Bank, grew at a rapid pace. The settlement populationin the West Bank and East Jerusalem grew from approximately 250,000 in 1993 to up to 700,000 in September this year. About three million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The building of Israeli settlements and aseparation wallon occupied territories has fragmented the the Palestinian communities and restricted their mobility. About 700 road obstacles, including 140 checkpoints, dot the West Bank. About 70,000 Palestinians with Israeli work permits cross these checkpoints in their daily commute. Settlementsare consideredillegal under international law. The UN has condemned settlements, calling ita big hurdlein the realisation of a viable Palestinian state as part of the so-called“two-state solution”.  Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in 2007 after the Hamas group came to power. The siege continues till date. Israel also occupies the West Bank and East Jerusalem – the territories Palestinians want to be part of their future state. Israel imposeda total blockadeon the Gaza Strip on October 9, cutting its supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel in the wake ofa surprise Hamas attackinside Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed in that attack.  This is what Israel and Palestine look like now.  Today, about 5 million Palestinians live in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem and 1.6 million Palestinians are citizens of Israel. This makes up about half of their total population. The other half lives in other countries, including Arab countries. There are about 14.7 million Jews around the world today, of which 84 percent live in Israel and the United States. The rest live in other countries including France, Canada, Argentina and Russia.   Here is an account of Palestinian and Israeli lives lost to the violence between 2008 and 2023.

"Analy­sis: Less than a day left on the Gaza pause, what are the prospects?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/analysis-less-than-a-day-left-on-the-gaza-pause-what-are-the-prospects,"After a tense delay on Saturday, the pause seems to be holding. Will Israel and Hamas agree to extend it? On Sunday, the third day of the truce between Hamas and Israel, both communities appeared to have gotten used to the guns being silent and captives being released. The first releases of the captives, on Friday, were tense as the procedures were unknown to all. Expectations were high and all waited for those first groups to get home. By Saturday, the media on both sides of the divide was inundated with emotional scenes of families reuniting and embracing their dearest. At one point on Saturday, it looked like fresh celebrations might have to be postponed – Hamas announced that it would not release the second batch of captives because Israel was not respecting the truce deal. Israeli forces were shooting at Palestinians trying to reach their homes, Israel was not releasing prisoners according to the agreed guidelines and, most importantly, aid deliveries were short of targets set in the agreement. Hamas warned that unless the agreed number of trucks enter the Strip, with a significant number taking supplies north to what remains of Gaza City, there would be no release. Qatari and Egyptian diplomats immediately went into overdrive and a frenzy of phone calls and emails is reported to have ensued. In a couple of hours, assurances acceptable to Hamas that the agreed number of aid trucks would get to Gaza before the truce expires on Tuesday morning were issued, and the captives were released late in the evening, the Palestinian detainees minutes later. The two divided communities took to the streets to vent 50 days of fear, anxiety and frustration in mass displays of emotion. In Tel Aviv, 100,000 Israelis rejoiced, half an hour’s drive away in Ramallah, Palestinians went around town singing and dancing. The celebrations repeated on Sunday. Saturday clearly demonstrated how much the world wants and needs this truce to succeed. Even limited as it is, and only four days, it is nevertheless the first positive development since October 7 and the international community is eager to extend it, hoping to make it permanent. We have heard that efforts are ongoing, although no details have leaked yet, but I am certain that the success of brokering the current truce encouraged countries to express to the warring sides, either directly or through Qatar and Egypt, their desire for the conflict to end and support for any deal the parties reach.  So strong is the desire for a feeble, limited pause to become a more lasting cessation of hostilities, that any inconvenience that could mar it is pushed aside, minimised or ignored. Like the Israeli forces killing of eight Palestinians in the occupied West Bank on Sunday. It made the news but nobody, Palestinian authorities included, pushed for the condemnation of the perpetrators or raised the issue with any international organisation. The truce seemed more precious than a few civilian lives. Even before the fighting paused Friday morning, it was clear that the warring sides and regional powers agreed that it should be given a chance and not be upset by any irresponsible act. The biggest worries were that Hezbollah, or the Houthis might continue or even step up their attacks on Israel, endangering the fragile ceasefire. Neither group was party to the agreement, so they did not have any obligation to honour it. Again, as several times earlier during the last seven weeks, Iran stepped in with uncharacteristic delicacy. To make sure Hezbollah would not do anything reckless, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian flew to Lebanon on Thursday, as pre-truce bombardments were still ongoing, to meet with Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah. Tehran’s message was clear, and the minister repeated it to the media: If the then-tentative truce is not observed, “the scope of the war will expand”. Known for its effective command and disciplined officers and soldiers, Hezbollah clearly decided to conduct itself as its mentors expected. Only one incident was reported, on Saturday, when Hezbollah fired a missile at an Israeli observation drone over Lebanese territory. Israel retaliated with artillery fire directed at the missile site but it seems that neither side wanted to escalate further. The Houthis were not subject to the same degree of attention from Tehran, so they showed less restraint. New missile launches against Israel – 2,000km (1,240 miles) away – were recorded after the start of the truce. No projectile managed to get through the multilayered defences consisting of US Navy destroyers in the Red Sea, an Israeli navy corvette in international waters at the top of the Gulf of Aqaba and Israeli air force aircraft ready to intercept anything that manages to squeeze through the shipborne defences. In a further escalation, the Houthis continued threatening cargo ships with alleged links to Israel. Just days after hijacking the Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader, on Saturday their armed drones attacked the Malta-flagged CMA CGM Symi without attempting to board it, unlike the next incident on Sunday when they first attacked from the air and then tried to hijack the Central Park, flying the Liberian flag. US Navy destroyer USS Mason, patrolling the Gulf of Aden, intervened, forcing the attackers to flee the ship. The Houthis, known for tenacity and aggressiveness, obviously do not feel obliged to refrain from attacking what they see as Israeli assets, so it is a blessing that their arsenal appears unable to mar the current agreement. After three days of quiet and captives from both sides coming home, we should remind ourselves that this almost idyllical respite is only scheduled to last until Tuesday and that in less than 24 hours, explosions will again rock the Gaza Strip and more people, civilians and soldiers, will be killed. As the expiry of the truce neared, both sides toyed with the possibility of extension. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, venturing into Gaza territory for a brief propaganda photo op amid heavy security, hinted that the truce could be extended if Hamas continued releasing hostages and that every group of 10 would buy another day of pause. Hamas told the Reuters news agency that it is seeking to extend the truce but wanted more Palestinians freed from Israeli jails. While something might be cooking under a tightfitting lid and civilians in Palestine and Israel seem hypnotised by three days of “peace”, soldiers and politicians remind them that it is only a pause after which the fighting is scheduled to continue. Chief of General Staff General Herzi Halevi said on Sunday that once the pause expires, his forces “will return to our operations with determination, for the continued release of the hostages and the complete dismantlement of Hamas”. The message was repeated by Netanyahu later as he vowed to continue “until victory”. Barring some last-minute miracle, it will be legal for both sides to resume military activities at 7am sharp on Tuesday 28 November. I have never seen a ceasefire last until the agreed-upon moment: Usually, they are either extended by an agreement made while they still last or they are broken before the deadline. In the absence of an official extension, it is very likely that fighting might resume on Monday night after the last batches of hostages are out and the last aid trucks are in. Realising that the last prisoner exchange is over, soldiers might not see a need to wait for hours until the official expiration. Any shot fired at or near the current front lines on Monday night will probably signal to every fighter to return to war with all his might. The only way to prevent the unravelling of the truce is to announce its extension before the last captives are freed on Monday.",Published On 27 Nov 2023
US Navy thwarts seizure of Is­rael-linked car­go ship,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/us-navy-thwarts-attempted-seizure-of-israel-linked-cargo-ship,"US destroyer USS Mason responds to a distress call from an Israel-linked commercial tanker in the Gulf of Aden. The US military has captured five attackers who seized an Israel-linked cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden amid missile attacks from Houthi-controlled Yemen. The destroyer USS Mason responded on Sunday to an SOS call from a commercial tanker that had been taken over by armed assailants in the Gulf, US Central Commandannounced. The Liberian-flagged tanker, which had been hauling phosphoric acid, was identified as the Central Park by the vessel’s company. The ship is managed by Zodiac Maritime Ltd, a London-headquartered international ship management firm, owned by Israel’s Ofer family. The US military said the USS Mason, with help from allied ships, demanded that the commercial ship be released by the attackers. “Subsequently, five armed individuals debarked the ship and attempted to flee via their small boat,” US Central Command said in a statement. “The Mason pursued the attackers resulting in their eventual surrender.” The statement added that two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen in the general direction of the Mason and the Central Park, but landed about 10 nautical miles away from the vessels, resulting in no damage or injuries. On Nov. 26, the USS MASON (DDG 87), with allied ships from our coalition counter-piracy task force (TF 151), and associated aircraft responded to a distress call from the M/V CENTRAL PARK, a commercial vessel, that they were under attack by an unknown entity. Upon arrival,…pic.twitter.com/ASmM3b0xrf — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM)November 27, 2023  Yemen’s government in Aden blamed the country’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels for the attack. However, the rebels, who control the capital, Sanaa, did not acknowledge either the seizure or the missile attack. The incident is the latest in a series of attacks in Middle Eastern waters since thewar in Gazabroke out on October 7. It followed theseizureof an Israeli-linked cargo ship by Houthi forces in the southern Red Sea last week. The Houthis, who have also fired ballistic missiles and armed drones at Israel, have promised to target more Israeli vessels.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Zodiac Maritime said in a statement that Central Park was involved in a suspected piracy incident while crossing international waters, approximately 54 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia. “Our priority is the safety of our 22 crew onboard. The Turkish-captained vessel has a multinational crew consisting of a crew of Russian, Vietnamese, Bulgarian, Indian, Georgian and Filipino nationals,” the statement added. Zodiac Maritime also thanked “the coalition forces who responded quickly, protecting assets in the area and upholding international maritime law”. Britain’s Maritime Trade Operations agency (UKMTO) said on Sunday it was aware of a possible attack in southwest Aden and called on other vessels to exercise caution. The US has blamed Iran for unclaimed attacks on several vessels in the region in the past few years. Tehran has denied involvement. A container ship managed by an Israeli-controlled company was hit by a suspected Iranian drone in the Indian Ocean, causing minor damage to the vessel but no injuries, a US defence official said on Saturday.",Published On 27 Nov 2023
"Bar­be­ques, sus­pi­cion and song as Is­raeli sol­diers break from Gaza war",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/27/barbeques-suspicion-and-song-as-israeli-soldiers-break-from-gaza-war,"Reservists come back to southern Israel, welcomed by families, feasts and distant explosions. Ashkelon, Israel –A middle-aged Israeli soldier with a thick, immaculately groomed moustache sits outside a bustling pizzeria on theperiphery of Ashkelon. The southern Israeli city is best characterised by its trademark monolithic beige residential towers, which overlook a scenic waterfront with a marina frequented by sun-seeking tourists during peacetime. The soldier’s steely gaze oscillates between an elderly couple sitting with him at a small outdoor table and each new customer who walks by. An archetype of the seasoned soldier with a thousand-yard stare. He speaks with a thick American accent in gentle, measured tones. In front of him, in the city’s main square, locals enthusiastically unpack meat, gently placing it on rows of industrial-size barbeques. Israeli reservists laugh and joke as they mingle with families. They have just been in the Gaza Strip for five days and have been allowed back to southern Israel for a break. The locals have put on a feast to welcome them. The silhouettes of young children dancing to a Hebrew version of, C’est la Vie, by Algerian singer Khaled appear amongst the thick clouds of smoke wafting through the still evening air. Several orange flashes fill the night sky in the distance, and a few seconds later, thunderous bangs ring out, echoing across the city’s labyrinth of residential towers. A stocky waiter runs out of the pizzeria. “Gaza?” he asks the small crowd as he looks up at the sky. The besieged enclave is about a dozen kilometres (seven miles) away. No one bothers to respond. I had been in Sderot a few hours earlier, a city located about a kilometre (0.6 miles) from Gaza, and had witnessed the bombardment of the area by Israeli forces. Smoke billowed continuously on the horizon from the city of Beit Hanoon in Gaza. The relentless sound of drones, warplanes and thuds echoed across the afternoon sky. Sderot had been attacked on October 7, and Hamas fighters and Israeli police and civilians had battled on its streets. Since then, the city has come under frequent rocket attacks, and the vast majority of residents have been evacuated. InAshkelonand Ashdod, cities further to the north, the Iron Dome system, which is about 90 percent effective, can knock most of the missiles out of the sky, creating a sense of relative security. Today’s heavy explosions have not caused any alarm, and locals marvel at the spectacle unfolding in the distance. The soldier doesn’t flinch; his eyes are fixed on my camera. While others smile, happy for me to record, he appears suspicious. He knows what the sounds entail, the destruction they bring. It’s a pattern I have seen repeated over weeks of covering this war, in the days before the truce that came into effect on November 24. In the first few days following October 7, young reservists, whipped up by jingoistic rhetoric, werechannelled to the border with the Gaza Stripalong motorways lined with thousands of Israeli flags. Disembarking from coaches, the atmosphere is raucous; friends from military service reunited and hugged each other. Thrust out of their day jobs, they are now backslapping soldiers. Revered as heroes and convinced that they were on the right side of history, they welcome media attention. They drape flags outside of their vehicles and flash peace signs at the camera. Their seniors, in contrast, stone-faced, remain focused on maps and battle plans. They are curt, formal, and sometimes jaded when talking to the media. Perhaps aware that much of the global reaction to the Israeli military campaign in Gaza would not fall in line with their narrative. The reservists in the square are not allowed to talk about what they did or saw in Gaza. They have to hand in their phones before they enter. Some wear military uniforms, others civilian clothes. Just over a month ago, many of them had been working office jobs, some in Tel Aviv’s trendy tech industry. One reservist was supposed to be backpacking in Australia before he was called up. They let slip an occasional story from their time across the border, from dramatic scenes of bullets flying over their heads to banal details about their tasteless rations, which include plenty of canned tuna. A local man handing out meat skewers who had helped organise the event jokes with a soldier who is wearing flip flops and shorts, his long brown hair tied into a ponytail. The local man also runs a group on the messaging service Telegram, which updates his friends with information he collects from social media about what is happening in Gaza. He excitedly shows me a video which appears to be from within Gaza which he says shows what the explosions we had just heard had been; I look at his phone and see terrified people running for cover as the same orange-tinted flashes and deafening explosions appear behind a series of buildings in northern Gaza. The Israeli soldiers, he says, only have 24 hours outside Gaza before they have to return, and he wants to give them a “hero’s welcome”. It is getting late and I start to head back to my car. The man grilling the barbeque leaves me with a reminder; “Please write good things about Israel.”",Published On 27 Nov 2023
Pho­tos: Pales­tini­ans gath­er in Ra­mal­lah streets to wel­come freed pris­on­ers,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/27/palestinians-gather-in-ramallah-streets-to-welcome-freed-prisoners,"In Pictures A third batch of 39 Palestinian prisoners was freed on Sunday, as the exchange of captives for prisoners between Hamas and Israel continued for a third day under the four-day truce deal. Under the deal, 13 Israeli captives were freed in the Palestinian territory, along with three Thais and a Russian-Israeli dual citizen. Large crowds of Palestinians took to the streets in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, on Sunday night as they waited for Red Cross buses carrying the prisoners. Some waved Palestinian flags, alongside the flags of the two main Palestinian political parties: Hamas and Fatah. Some youths climbed on top of a white bus mostly transporting young men but also carrying some released female prisoners. “At first we did not believe it,” Shakir Mahajna told Al Jazeera while he waited with his family for his son Omar, who recently turned 18. “The last time I visited him he was frustrated, he told me ‘Dad I want to leave’,” said Mahajna. His son was 16 when he was arrested and had had four months left in his sentence. “After what happened in October, I was even more scared,” Nour Ara’ar, whose 17-year-old brother Zeid was arrested in July, told Al Jazeera. “Everything was suspended because of the war,” she added. “The trial did not take place.” “We are happy, but we are experiencing mixed feelings.

‘Dev­as­tat­ing’: Vol­un­teer re­calls last hours at be­sieged In­done­sian Hos­pi­tal,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/volunteer-calls-final-hours-at-indonesian-hospital-amid-israeli-siege,"Medical worker Fikri Rofiul Haq says lsraeli tanks repeatedly fired on hospital in northern Gaza. Medan, Indonesia –As Israeli tanks and troops laid siege to the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza last week,volunteer medical worker Fikri Rofiul Haq faced the choice of evacuating to safety or staying with his patients. Haq and fellow his Indonesian colleagues, Reza Aldilla Kurniawan and Farid Zazabil Al Ayubi, volunteers with the Jakarta-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER-C), opted to stay put until the Israeli military forced them to leave, he said. “We were evacuated via a route used by the International Red Cross with the permission of the Israeli army. There were three evacuations on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and we were evacuated last as we prioritised the wounded who were at the Indonesian Hospital,” Haq told Al Jazeera. Haq said that Israeli forces deliberately destroyed the Indonesian-funded hospital’s only working generator by setting it on fire and killed 12 people with indiscriminate shelling of the first, second and third floors of the building. “Before we were evacuated, the attacks got worse and worse, hour by hour,” said Haq, who was unable to communicate for several weeks until his evacuation to Khan Younis. “I saw it with my own eyes. There were three large tanks around 50 metres [54 yards] from the Indonesian Hospital building and they fired periodically at the hospital, which was devastating. Now the Indonesian Hospital has been completely taken over by the Israeli army,” he said. Israeli forces, who initially gave medical staff and patients just hours to leave the hospital, have been accused of reducing one of Gaza’s largest medical facilities to ruins in the days leading up to the four-day truce with Hamas, which began on Friday. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Friday that Israeli fire in the final hours before the pause killed one woman and injured at least three other people. Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, who gained access to the facility, reported that there was a “stench of death” outside the hospital “as charred and decomposing bodies, children among them, pile up in corners”. Sarbini Abdul Murad, the head of MER-C in Jakarta, said the attacks on the hospital were a violation of international law and that Indonesia should do more to hold Israel to account given the country’s links to the hospital, which was inaugurated in 2016 by Indonesia’s then-Vice President Jusuf Kalla after being funded with donations from Indonesian citizens and humanitarian organisations. However, Jakarta’s leverage may be limited. Indonesia does not have diplomatic ties with Israel and the hospital is not owned by Indonesia or Indonesians since it was donated to the people of Gaza. “The Indonesian Hospital was built with donations by Indonesian citizens and flies the Indonesian flag as a symbol of our friendship,” Sarbini told Al Jazeera. “The most we can do at MER-C is represent the Indonesian people and encourage the Indonesian government and the foreign ministry to take this case to the International Criminal Court (ICC).” “Everyone needs to lobby the ICC, particularly the big five [the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States], and call for a permanent ceasefire,” he added. Sarbini said there are no plans to permanently evacuate the three Indonesian volunteers from Gaza as there is still important work for them to do in terms of providing humanitarian assistance to the wounded and displaced in Khan Younis. For now, Haq and his colleagues are taking stock of their situation as they figure out how they can best help the people of Gaza. He said they are being fed well after surviving for days on dwindling rations of food and water at the besieged Indonesian Hospital. “Thank God, we have enough food here now and there are people selling supplies around the European Hospital in Khan Younis,” Haq said. “We are eating French fries, fried aubergines and fried peppers. Sometimes we are able to get rice with a little meat, and sometimes we eat local food like bread and hummus.”",Published On 27 Nov 2023

Speaking from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim said that many believed the delayed release of the Palestinian prisoners was intentional on the part of Israeli authorities to prevent celebrations. “People here believe that the delay is intentional to prevent the scenes that we’ve been seeing in the past three days. Palestinians holding the detainees on their shoulders. Giving them a hero’s welcome here in the occupied West Bank,” Ibrahim said. The long delay, cold weather and increased insecurity for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank might also result in fewer people turning out to greet the released prisoners, she said. “Many families could not make it from Jenin, from Nablus, from places across the occupied West Bank. That has become more difficult since October 7 with the increased Israeli security checkpoints as well as the intensification of settler attacks against Palestinians.” Live footage aired on Al Jazeera television shows a Red Cross bus carrying the Palestinian prisoners from Ofer Prison. Prisoners freed to the occupied West Bank were released from Ofer, while those returning to occupied East Jerusalem were released from Moscovia prison, according to Wafa news agency. 150 Palestinian women and children have now been released from Israeli prisons as part of the truce deal. The Committee to Protect Journalists says it has documented assaults on Palestinian journalists outside Ofer prison in the past days. Several reporters were attacked on Sunday while covering the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, CPJ said. #Update:@pressfreedomhas documented the assaults on Palestinian journalists who reported in front of Ofer prison, in addition to the threats received by freelance journalist@azaizamotaz9and@AlJazeera's journalist Anas Al-Sharif.https://t.co/QNbTkj9kt1 — CPJ MENA (@CPJMENA)November 27, 2023  The Palestine Red Crescent says in post on X that Awni Khattab, head of the Khan Younis Emergency Medical Center, is still in Israeli custody after being arrested six days ago.

Meanwhile, in nearby Beitunia, where some Palestinians had also gathered, three Palestinians aged 15, 18 and 33 were injured after Israeli forces fired live rounds, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said. Two children, aged 11 and 13, were admitted to a hospital for tear-gas inhalation, the PRCS added. Hamas frees American child, Russian man Earlier on Sunday, Hamas handed over 13 Israeli captives, including nine children and four foreign nationals – three Thais and one Israeli Russian – to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as part of the truce deal. The Israeli Russian was released “in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s efforts and in recognition of Russia’s position in support of Palestine”, Hamas said in a statement. He is the first male captive to be released since the truce deal came into effect. US President Joe Biden said a four-year-old Israeli-American girl, Abigail Edan, whose parents were killed in the October 7 Hamas attack, was also among those released. “She’s free and she’s in Israel,” he said, adding that another dual American citizen – a 45-year-old woman – was also released. Biden also urged the parties to extend the truce deal to allow for more releases. The exchange of captives wasdelayedby a few hours on Saturday after Hamas accused Israel of violating the truce agreement. The standoff sparked concerns that the deal was at risk of derailing. The impasse was resolved following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. Around150 Palestinian prisonersand 50 civilian captives held in Gaza are to be released over four days under the Israel-Hamas deal. Israel’s ground and air assault on the besieged Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 15,000 Palestinians and left vast swathes of the enclave in ruins. Ahead of Sunday’s exchange, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Gaza, the first since the Gaza assault began last month. “We continue until the end – until victory,” he told soldiers, footage posted online by his office showed. “Nothing will stop us, and we are convinced that we have the power, the strength, the will and the determination to achieve all the war’s goals, and we will.” Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said it was the first time an Israeli prime minister entered Gaza since Israel disengaged from the enclave in 2005. “It is a landmark visit,” he said. “We’ve heard Netanyahu talk about victory but not in this location. This location is what he wants the Israeli public to see,” he added, calling it a “photo-op”. In a statement on Sunday, Hamas said it is seeking to extend the four-day truce with Israel should serious efforts be made to increase the number of Palestinian detainees released from Israeli prisons. Speaking from Beirut, senior Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera he expected US President Biden to push Israel to end its war on the Gaza Strip. “President Biden has the ability to make an end to the Israeli offensive against Gaza. He has the power to do that and talking about extending the ceasefire is not the solution. “The solution is to stop the Israeli attack against Gaza and to force Israel to implement international resolutions regarding the Palestinian people,” he said.",Published On 26 Nov 2023
"Three Pales­tin­ian stu­dents shot in Ver­mont, US amid Is­rael-Hamas truce",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/26/three-palestinian-men-shot-in-vermont-us-amid-israel-hamas-truce,"While the motive behind the attack is unknown, it came amid rising anti-Palestine sentiments in the US. Three young Palestinian menhave been shotnear a university campus in Vermont in the United States, according to media reports. Reports said the incident took place on Saturday evening near the University of Vermont’s campus in the city of Burlington. The three were identified as Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdel Hamid and Tahseen Ahmed. They are studying at three different universities in the US. According to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), two of the victims are in intensive care while one was due to be released on Sunday. “[We] are deeply distressed by the recent incident involving three of our graduates,” the Ramallah Friends School in the occupied West Bank, where the three studied, said in a statement on Facebook. “While we are relieved to know they are alive, we remain uncertain about their condition. We extend our thoughts and prayers to them and their families for a full recovery, especially considering the severity of the injuries – as Hisham has been shot in the back, Tahseen in the chest, and Kinnan with minor injuries.” Three young Palestinian men, Hisham Awartani, Tahseen Ali and Kenan Abdulhamid, students at Brown and other US universities, were shot last night on their way to a family dinner in Burlington, USA.

When contacted by Al Jazeera, the Burlington police did not immediately respond to a request for further information. The ADC said it was contacted about the shooting earlier on Sunday, and that it has “reason to believe [it] was motivated by the three victims being Arab”. “According to the information provided, the three victims were wearing a keffiyeh and speaking Arabic. A man shouted and harassed the victims, then proceeded to shoot them,” the group said in astatement.

The surge in anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian sentiment we are experiencing is unprecedented, and this is another example of that hate turning violent.” The families of three students have urged law enforcement authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, “including treating this as a hate crime”. “We will not be comfortable until the shooter is brought to justice,” the families said in a joint statement. “We need to ensure that our children are protected, and this heinous crime is not repeated. No family should ever have to endure this pain and agony.” The incident came amid arise in anti-Palestinian sentimentsin the US, with both Republican and Democratic politicians backing Israel’swar in Gazadespite the mounting Palestinian death toll and growing accusations of war crimes.

Crowds chanted “God is Great” as the bus arrived, and several young men stood on the roof of the vehicle. Many in the crowd held Hamas flags and chanted pro-Hamas slogans. Many Palestinians viewprisoners held by Israel, including those implicated in attacks, as heroes resisting occupation, and have celebrated their release. The arrival of the Palestinian prisoners, six women and 33 children, has brought tears and joy as they were received by their families in the occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank.

Biden seeks to lift re­stric­tions on Is­raeli ac­cess to US weapons,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/26/biden-seeks-to-expand-israeli-access-to-us-weapons-stockpile,"If White House request granted, it would enable Israel to access US weapons with less congressional oversight. The White House aims to lift nearly all restrictions on Israel’s access to weapons from a crucial US stockpile, enabling a smoother weapons pipeline to Israel, which has paused weeks of its devastating bombing of the Gaza Strip. The White House asked the United States Senate to scrap the restrictions in its latest supplementary budget request on October 20. If granted, the request would enable Israel to access more high-powered US weapons at a reduced cost, with less congressional oversight. The request proposes changes to policies governing the War Reserve Stockpile Allies-Israel (WRSA-I), an Israel-based US weapons stockpile that has smart bombs, missiles, military vehicles, and other ammunition and equipment. The stockpile, set up in the 1980s, gives the Pentagon a strong weapons cache to tap into in the event of regional conflicts. Israel, the US’s principal ally in the Middle East, has also been able to pull some weapons from the reserve in emergency cases and buy them at a reduced cost. However, it has been able to access only certain classes of weapons deemed “obsolete or surplus”. The White House’s request would eliminate such conditions, enabling the US to transfer all “defence articles” from its stockpile to Israel. It would also waive a yearly limit on the amount Washington spends refilling the cache, and curb congressional oversight on the transfers. Josh Paul, a former director in the Department of State’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, toldThe Interceptthe request “would essentially create a free-flowing pipeline to provide any defense articles to Israel by the simple act of placing them in the WRSA-I stockpile, or other stockpiles intended for Israel”. Worth $3.8bn per year, the US already sends more military aid to Israel than any other country. Since Israel’s military assault on Gaza on October 7, the US has moved to up this number, with the House of Representatives approving a $14.3bn emergency military aid package to Israel. However, there are signs that theUS public’ssupport for military aid to Israel is waning amid the Gaza war, in which Israeli attacks have killed nearly 15,000 Palestinians, including 6,000 children.

Israeli forces have killed eight Palestinians, including a child, in the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, taking the total number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank to 239 since October 7. Israeli forces shot dead five Palestinians in the city of Jenin late on Saturday and early Sunday, and killed three others elsewhere in the West Bank, the ministry said on Sunday. Six other Palestinians were injured in the Israeli raid in Jenin. Palestinian news agency Wafa said Israeli forces stormed Jenin “from several directions, firing bullets and surrounding government hospitals and the headquarters of the Red Crescent Society”. The Israeli military spokesperson’s office said it was looking into the reports. The raids come despite an ongoing four-day truce between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas in the war-torn Gaza Strip, where nearly 15,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,000 children, have been killed in Israeli strikes. Israeli officials said 1,200 people were killed in the surprise Hamas attack on October 7, when the Palestinian group took about 240 people captive. On Saturday, Hamas released 13 Israeli and four Thai captives, while Israel released a first batch of 39 Palestinian prisoners in exchange.

‘Fear and anx­i­ety’ grip south­ern Gaza amid in­tense Is­raeli bom­bard­ment,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/12/5/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-attacks-on-southern-gaza-reach-new-depths,"The Israeli military says three more soldiers were killed during fighting on Tuesday and four others were seriously injured in various battles in northern Gaza. The dead were identified as a 23-year-old officer and two soldiers, 20 and 21 years old, in the Israeli military’s 188th Armoured Brigade’s 53rd Battalion. More than 80 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave, the UN said on Tuesday, citing official Israeli sources. It was not known if the latest deaths announced by Israel were part of that total. According to a video clip posted on X by Al Jazeera Arabic, the man’s daughter and grand-daughter were killed in the latest Israeli strike in central Gaza’s city of Deir al-Balah. In the video, the elderly man was seen sobbing as he kissed the remains of his grand-daughter and placed it on the floor of a makeshift morgue. Israeli forces have been targeting several areas of Gaza overnight, but updates on casualties have been scarce, as the besieged enclave faces another communications blackout.  Translation It’s coming up to 7am on Tuesday (05:00 GMT) in the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel. Here are some of the latest key developments: Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem This is a social media row that is burning up and we can expect that it will continue to rumble on. Earlier, we had WHO [World Health Organisation] Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, sending out a message on X, saying that the UN agency received notification from Israel, to remove supplies from a medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use. He then made an appeal to Israel to withdraw the order. COGAT, the Israeli agency that deals with civilian policies in the Palestinian territories, said that they did not ask the WHO to evacuate. But we can see that the WHO did take this seriously to start moving stuff out of the warehouse. Fatima Salem, a Palestinian activist who resisted Israeli attempts toevict her familyfrom their home in occupied East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah, has passed away. “Our hearts are broken by the news of Fatma Salem’s passing,” Ir Amim, an Israeli organisation that focuses on the Israel-Palestine conflict in Jerusalem wrote in a post on X. “We grieve that she left this earth before seeing the arc of justice, yet remain resolute in the shared struggle to press on and demand it,” Ir Amim wrote. Mohammed El-Kurd, a Palestinian writer from Sheik Jerreh, shared a memory of Salem in apost on X: “Israeli lawmaker Ben Gvir once set up a makeshift ‘office’ in her yard, under army protection, but she stubbornly fought him.”  Israeli forces continue to conduct “clearing operations” in the northern Gaza Strip as they attempt to encircle Hamas fighters in what they describe as strongholds in the Shujaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City and Jabalia City, located 4km (2.5 miles) to the north, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The Washington, DC-based think tank said Israel’s military has warned the Hamas commanders in Shujaiya that “Israel will use extreme force in the neighbourhood” to destroy the Palestinian armed group. Palestinian fighters with Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the smaller Palestinian Resistance Committees are battling Israeli forces in Gaza using small arms, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), anti-armour grenades, mortars, and improvised “armour-piercing” explosive devices targeting Israeli tanks, the ISW said. “This is consistent with Hamas’ use of increasingly sophisticated tactics against Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip after the end of the humanitarian pause. The al Qassem Brigades [Hamas’s military wing] claimed four attacks on Israeli forces and vehicles east of Beit Lahiya using RPGs and anti-personnel munitions,” the think tank said.  An exclusive Al Jazeera video posted on social media shows destruction just outside the gates of Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia in northern Gaza. Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Anas al-Sharif, who is reporting from inside the hospital, said that several people have been killed and injured following Israeli strikes, which have sent waves of panic through the thousands of displaced civilians seeking shelter inside the medical facility. “There’s a large number of displaced children, women, elderly and the sick here,” al-Sharif said. “The situation here is dire. There’s a sense of fear because the bombing has not stopped.”  [Translation: Al Jazeera monitors the gathering of large numbers of displaced people inside Kamal Adwan Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, coinciding with the escalation of the occupation’s bombing of the area.] reporting from occupied East Jerusalem A meeting with the entirety of the war cabinet including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to take place on Tuesday, though it was originally scheduled for Monday. This is the second meeting of its kind as Israeli families are demanding answers on how to bring their loved ones back immediately. There has been immense pressure on Netanyahu and his war cabinet, not just from the families of those being held captive inside Gaza but from Israeli society as a whole. Public opinion is totally and completely behind the “Bring them back” campaign and it is the most sensitive and important issue within Israeli society. Dozens of Israeli armoured vehicles and military bulldozers have been deployed across the occupied West Bank, as its forces carried out a series of raids and arrested several people, including in Wadi al-Nis south of Bethlehem. Israeli forces also carried out raids and arrests in the following areas:  [Translation: Israeli occupation bulldozers destroy streets in Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.] Rapper and activist Lowkey has released a new track to show solidarity with Palestinians and shed light on Israel’s war on Gaza.

The hospital located in Khan Younis, where teams from Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) provide surgical care to patients with trauma and burn injuries, has also seen a constant influx of new patients, pushing its capacity to breaking point. “The hospital has been receiving multiple severely injured patients nearly every hour,” said Chris Hook, MSF medical coordinator in Khan Younis. “With the situation as it is in the hospital – there is no available space any more – it really is a terrible situation. Everyone is genuinely worried about what will come next.” Israel’s military said its fighter jets and helicopters struck targets in Gaza including “tunnel shafts, command centers and weapons storage facilities”. It acknowledged “extensive aerial attacks in the Khan Younis area”. “In a military campaign that has lasted weeks, with only a brief respite, the speed and scale of the bombing continue to plumb the depths of brutality,” said MSF’s Hook. “Almost two million people are left without options. The only solution is an immediate and sustained ceasefire and the unrestricted supply of aid to the entirety of the Gaza Strip.”",Published On 4 Dec 2023
"Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, in­ter­net down in Gaza as Is­raeli strikes in­ten­si­fy",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/4/telecommunications-internet-down-in-gaza-as-israeli-strikes-intensify,"Palestinian telecoms company Paltel says communications and internet services go down in the besieged Gaza Strip. Telecommunication services have been cut off in theGaza Strip, the Palestinian telecoms company Paltel has said, as Israel intensifies its assault on the besieged territory. “We regret to announce the complete cessation of the communications and Internet services with the Gaza strip, as the main paths that were previously reconnected were disconnected again,” Paltel said in a statement on Monday. Cybersecurity watchdog NetBlocks confirmed that the “near-total internet blackout” would be “experienced as a total loss of communications by most residents”.  The announcement came amid intense air strikes across Gaza as Israel expanded its assault on the besieged territory that began on October 7 after Hamas fighters from Gaza carried out an attack on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. At least 15,899 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive, according to Palestinian authorities, and more than 75 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said at least 50 people were killed in an Israeli air strike that hit two schools sheltering displaced people in the Daraj neighbourhood of Gaza City, in northern Gaza. WAFA reported that ambulances were struggling to reach the sites of the strikes to evacuate the victims due to the intensity of artillery shelling. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the report. Israel’s military on Monday called for more evacuations in southern Gaza as it widened its offensive. Israel ordered Palestinians to leave parts of southern Gaza’s main city, Khan Younis, but residents said that areas which they had been told to go to were also coming under fire. Israeli troops and tanks also pressed theground campaignin the south of the enclave after having largely gained control of the now-devastated north. “We are beginning to expand the ground manoeuvre to other parts of the Strip, with one goal – to topple the Hamas terrorist group,” Brigadier-General Hisham Ibrahim told Army Radio. Israel’s military posted a map on social media platform X with around a quarter of Khan Younis marked off as territory that must be evacuated at once. The arrows pointed south and west towards the Mediterranean coast and towards Rafah, a major town near the Egyptian border. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, said the area around the facility was under “relentless, uninterrupted bombing and artillery shelling”. “We haven’t heard such bombardment in the vicinity of the hospital before,” he said. “The south of the Gaza Strip has also been under relentless air strikes. The fact is that there is no safe place inside the Gaza Strip,” Abu Azzoum noted. The director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), Thomas White, said there were no safe places for people seeking to flee the bombardment. “People are pleading for advice on where to find safety. We have nothing to tell them,” he said on X. Bombing at one site in Rafah overnight had torn a crater the size of a basketball court out of the earth, Reuters reported. Israel’s closest ally, the United States, has called on it to do more to safeguard civilians in the southern part of Gaza than in last month’s campaign in the north. Washington on Monday said it was asking Israel to let morefuel into the Gaza Strip. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to Israel to “avoid further action that would exacerbate the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and to spare civilians from more suffering”, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. “The Secretary-General reiterates the need for unimpeded and sustained humanitarian aid flow to meet the needs of the people throughout the Strip,” Dujarric said. “For people ordered to evacuate, there is nowhere safe to go and very little to survive on.”  This is a modal window.

"Is­rael asks Pales­tini­ans to evac­u­ate, but is any place safe in Gaza?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/4/israel-asks-palestinians-to-evacuate-but-is-any-place-safe-in-gaza,"Israel has issued an evacuation map asking Palestinians to move south as it intensifies attacks on the besieged enclave. The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of Palestinians from southern Gaza as it continues with the bombardment in the area following thecollapse of a weeklong truce on Friday. But Palestinians and rights groups question the Israeli decision to step up bombing in the besieged enclave’s south, which was declared a safe zone when the war began about two months ago. This has left Palestinians in Gaza with virtually nowhere to go. Here is what we know so far: More than one million Palestinians have been displaced from northern Gaza since October 13, when the Israeli military ordered people toevacuateto the south on 24 hours’ notice. More than 15,500 Palestinians have been killed and northern Gaza has since been devastated in weeks of indiscriminate bombings.  About 958,000 displaced Palestinians were registered in 99 UNRWA shelters in the centre and south of Gaza, according to the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA; 70 of these centres are in the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. Another 191,000 were estimated to be in informal collective shelters: 124 public schools, hospitals, wedding halls, offices, and community centres. The rest were hosted by families, added OCHA. OCHA reported that the UNRWA shelters are now overcrowded and have poor sanitary conditions, which has led to outbreaks of infections and diseases such as Hepatitis A.  This is a modal window.

Israel has declared Khan Younis “a dangerous combat zone” after the truce ended, pummeling the besieged enclave’s second-largest city – home to 430,000 people. On Sunday, Israel’s military designated about 20 percent of Khan Younis for immediate evacuation. The marked area houses 21 shelters and 50,000 internally displaced people, mostly from the north of Gaza, according to OCHA. Israel ordered the evacuation as it has expanded its bombardment, killing more than 800 Palestinians in Gaza in the past three days. Residents say they have been told to move to Rafah, which has also not been spared. Khan Younis was a designated safe space before the truce ended and 215,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering in 34 UNRWA shelters in the city. Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians took shelter in other places provided by the local authorities.  The Israeli army published anonline map of the Gaza Stripon Friday, dividing the enclave into more than 600 numbered blocks. It asked Gaza’s civilians to identify the block corresponding with their area of residence and evacuate when ordered. On Saturday, Israel used the grid system toorderevacuation for the first time when military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted warnings online, urging Palestinians to evacuate from about 20 areas zones in Gaza, with three arrows on a map, all pointing south indicating where people should go.  However, leaflets distributed ordering evacuations are inconsistent with online warnings, which has confused the residents. Furthermore, several Gaza residents have no reliable way to access the map, with little access to electricity or the internet since the blockade of the 365sq km (141sq miles) strip has resulted in a collapse of telecommunications infrastructure. The military offensive continues as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday the war will not end until its goal of destroying Hamas was achieved despite international outcry against the staggering number of Palestinian casualties. Nearly 70 Israeli soldiers have been killed during the ground invasion in Gaza. Israel promised vengeance after the Hamas armed group carried out a surprise attack on October 7 inside Israel, killing up to 1,200 people.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

The Israeli military said on X on Monday that it was defining “safe areas” for civilians to minimise harm to them. However, Al Jazeera journalists and people on the ground say it is difficult to heed these orders in real time when there is no safe place left in the enclave. Even shelters are not safe, as of November 23, UNRWA reported that at least 191 displaced Palestinians in shelters were killed and 798 were injured. An analysis of the casualty figures shows that nearly 80 percent of the people killed in Israeli attacks are civilians. Israel on Saturday ordered residents of neighbourhoods in the east of Gaza City, including Shujayea, Zeitoun and the Old City, to evacuate to the west. Tzipi Hotovely, the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom, told Sky News that al-Mawasi, a narrow coastal Bedouin town towards the south, is a safe zone and is one of the shelters created with aid organisations. When Sky News correspondents visited al-Mawasi to investigate, they found no shelter arrangements such as agency tents or food kitchens. Some Palestinians are fleeing for the fourth time since the outbreak of violence on October 7. Rafik al-Rekeb who was displaced from Bani Suheila in Khan Younis, told Al Jazeera: “A safe area should be equipped with all the necessities” such as tents. “There aren’t any safe areas in Gaza. Am I supposed to sleep with my children in the rain in this designated safe area?” said al-Rekeb. The UN has called Gaza “a death zone” and “a graveyard for children”, calling for a pause in the fighting. It has struggled to bring in aid due to Israel’s total siege of the enclave. The supply of aid, however, picked up during the one-week truce. “The people in Gaza are staring into the humanitarian abyss,” former UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness told Al Jazeera.

"Fi­nal­ly free, Ubai was among the last Pales­tin­ian de­tainees Is­rael re­leased",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/4/finally-free-ubai-was-among-the-last-palestinian-detainees-israel-released,"Tired but relieved, the teen is happy he can resume treatment to save his arm and pursue his dreams for the future again. On his first morning of freedom after being released from Israeli prison,Ubai Youssef Abu Mariawandered around his home, checking in on his parents, as if to make sure everyone was there. They had all gotten home at dawn that day, Friday, and while his body was tired, he was so happy to be home that he only managed two hours of sleep before he went to his parents’ room and woke them up. Only half-joking, he asked his mother Fidaa, 38, to make him a breakfast he had been dreaming of since October 7 – qalayet banadora, a spicy skillet of fresh tomatoes simmered with hot Palestinian chilli peppers. It was served with the requisite fruity olive oil, special family-recipe zaatar and a cup of sweet tea. As he ate, Ubai told his mother that he had eaten nothing that tasted anything but awful over the past two months. He missed being home and being taken care of. Then, he headed out to the barber’s to trim his “wild” hair that had not been tended to for two months, returning groomed and feeling a bit more normal. Ubai Youssef Abu Maria is 18, lives north of Hebron and has already been arrested six times by Israeli forces. Sometimes he was held for days, sometimes for hours. The first time, he was 14 years old and was held for 15 days. A year later, when he was only 15, he was arrested again and held for nine months. The last time he was taken was on October 8 and told he would be in administrative detention, a near-informal status that ostensibly lasts six months but is often renewed over and over with the detained person never being charged or tried. Each time, his parents watched and waited, worrying about their son. Then a “humanitarian pause” was declared between Israel and Hamas this month, with an exchange of captives for prisoners as part of the deal – hope reared its head and Ubai’s parents Fidaa and Youssef started to get ready, in case Ubai was released. He eventually was, in the seventh and last batch of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli detention on Thursday. “I saw the happiness in my father’s eyes,” Ubai said. “For us, we’re friends more than father and son, and I look up to him as a role model. “He was worried for me in detention, especially because of my injured arm.” Ubai had been shot in the elbow by Israeli forces last November, losing 70 percent use of his arm as a result. He had been undergoing post-surgical treatment, but his arrest just one month after the platinum pins were removed from his elbow cut that short. “I told the Israelis over and over that my arm was injured. They didn’t care, in fact, it seemed to amuse them to shackle my hands anyway,” Ubai said. “Even the prison doctor laughed at me when I asked for medicine. Made me think that this guy is a jailer in a doctor’s coat. They only gave me Acamol [paracetamol] once. That was it. “I’m happy that I can continue my treatment now. I’m home, and I can see my family and be with them. There are no words to describe this joy.” When Ubai walked into the house at dawn on Friday, Fidaa was taken aback at first. “I kept looking at him, found myself backing away and thinking in disbelief: ‘That’s not my boy.’ He looked so different, not the healthy boy he was, he had lost so much weight, looked so exhausted, skin and bones with big messy hair on top. “I cried, with joy I guess, I don’t know. My first words to him were ‘How’s your arm? Move it, show me how it is.’” Ubai’s first words to his mother were sweeter, as he hugged her, told her he missed her and called her “My Life”, an Arabic term of endearment he uses for her. Shortly after that, he had to show her that his arm was still mobile, of course. As for his father, he had greeted him with “My Crown”, which is a cross between a term of endearment and “boss”. After a breakfast fit for a king and a trip to the barber, Ubai’s house filled up with family and friends coming to see him and welcome him home. So many that he wasn’t able to get his favourite meal at lunchtime, stuffed zucchini in a yoghurt sauce, and had to be satisfied with a promise that he’d be able to have it on Saturday. Reunions with loved ones were more than enough to make up for any culinary disappointments though, and Ubai spoke to Al Jazeera fondly about seeing his childhood friend, Mahdi Hammad, when he got off the prison transport vehicle that brought him from Ofer Prison to Ramallah. “He took me to my father and family, they had already been waiting for me for 10 hours by the time I got there at 2am. “I can’t describe seeing them again, it’s a mix of joy and sadness. Happy with the warm embraces I came back to and in tears over what is happening to Gaza, the brutal tax which resulted in the release of Palestinian prisoners. I couldn’t believe it, that I would be part of the deal.” After the Aqsa Storm operation, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners becameworse than ever, Ubai said. All television access was cut off, and then all appliances, blankets and spare clothing were removed from cells. “The prison guards punished us a lot, like they were taking their October 7 humiliation out on us,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that guards would burst into cells several times a day, beating, searching and trying to humiliate prisoners. “We weren’t allowed to raise our heads or look them in the eye, if someone did that they would be beaten badly and put in solitary where they would be assaulted again, out of sight.” The day Ubai was released, he was shackled at 7am and led from his cell in the Nafha Prison to theprison “bosta” transport vehicle, which was completely dark inside and divided into several tight cells with metal seats in them but he was not able to sit down on that ride to Ofer Prison near Ramallah. Once there, as other prisoners have detailed, Ubai was held in a cell, freezing cold this time given the time of the year. “I didn’t have enough clothes to keep warm, they had confiscated all my belongings, and stayed like that for about six hours. I could feel my limbs freeze, especially my injured left arm, and the whole time I had no idea what this was all for, nobody had told me what was going on. “Then a Shin Bet officer burst into the cell and told me I’d leave prison, but he was shouting and threatening me too, saying that I couldn’t celebrate, carry resistance flags, receive well-wishers, or have any political activity. ‘You’ll be arrested again,’ he said.” Fidaa was sitting near Ubai, a beaming smile on her face. But it covered a deeper sadness, she said. “As a Palestinian mother, we can’t keep our kids inside all the time to protect them from what the occupation may do to them. They’re constantly in danger of being harassed, detained, hurt or, even worse, killed by the occupation’s blind bullets “And look at him! He’s back but he suffered so much in prison. The stories of what happened to him and other prisoners in there are awful, and the stories of what is happening to the people of Gaza are heartbreaking.” For now, Ubai can turn back to his hobby that he hopes to turn into a career: car electrics. So he plans to complete the treatment his arm needs, then start working on becoming an auto electrician. But first, spending more time with his family. “Ubai is my friend, companion and support… When I saw him, it was like he had been reborn,” Youssef said tearfully, hugging Ubai close.",Published On 4 Dec 2023
Houthis tar­get Is­rael-linked ships in Red Sea. Here’s what you need to know,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/4/yemens-houthis-target-israeli-linked-ships-in-red-sea-heres-what-to-know,"The Houthis seem to have made a strategic shift towards maritime operations to ramp up pressure on the US and Israel. The Iran-backed Houthi movement in Yemen has launched a series of new attacks against Israel-linked vessels in the Red Sea that drew a response from a United States warship deployed in one of the world’s busiest maritime routes. The powerful group, which controls Yemeni capital Sanaa and commands an expanding military, has promised more attacks will be launched if Israel and the US refuse to put a stop tothe war on Gaza, which has killed more than 15,500 Palestinians since October 7. Let’s take a look at the latest attacks, why the Bab al-Mandeb Strait where they took place is important, and how the situation could unfold as the Israeli war machine shows no signs of stopping. The US military said late on Sunday that three commercial vessels came under attack in the strait – a narrow sea passage that separates the Arabian Peninsula from the Horn of Africa. The Houthisclaimed strikes on only two ships. Several projectiles are believed to have been fired at the Bahamas-flagged bulk carrier Unity Explorer, with at least one hitting its target and inflicting damage. The USS Carney, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, said it shot down a drone that appeared to be headed its way, and also downed two more drones while responding to distress calls by the ships. The other two commercial ships, the Panamanian-flagged bulk carriers Number 9 and Sophie II, were also struck by missiles. US Central Command did not report any casualties. It said Washington has “every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran”. Tehran has not commented officially on the latest attack, but it previously maintained that while it supports a “resistance axis” consisting of groups in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, its members operate autonomously. Iran-backed Hezbollah group has been engaged in a deadly border fight with Israeli forces in solidarity with Palestinians. Dozens of Hezbollah fighters have been killed, including journalists, in Israeli shelling, raising fears of a regional escalation. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree accepted responsibility for two of the attacks but did not mention claims of its drones being engaged by a US warship. “The Yemeni armed forces renew their warning to all Israeli ships or those associated with Israelis that they will become a legitimate target” if Israel does not stop its attacks on the Gaza Strip, he said. The Bab al-Mandeb is a 25km (15 miles) strait that connects the Gulf of Aden south of Yemen to the Red Sea, which stretches to southern Israel and is a significant shipping lane. The Houthis are effectively setting their sights on one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, where goods and oil are transported in large quantities. By focusing on Bab al-Mandeb – andlaunching earlier attacks in the Red Seaand southern Israel – the Houthis appear to be trying to impose hefty financial costs on Israel in addition to undermining its security if it chooses to prolong the war. Israel also extensively uses the route for trade and imports much of its food supply from there. The cost of insuring Israeli ships or those carrying goods to Israel will likely keep rising if the attacks are ongoing. It is possible that some ships that see themselves exposed to risk due to links with Israel may opt to avoid Bab al-Mandeb and the Red Sea altogether, with companies instead resorting to longer routes around Africa or more expensive air transport. Eilat, a southern Israeli port and resort town on the Red Sea, is a tourist destination that will take a financial hit if its security is compromised for longer periods. The Iran-backed Houthis publicly announced their participation in the war in late October bylaunching a considerable number of missiles and dronestowards southern Israel. Most of them are believed to have been intercepted – either by Israeli defence systems or the US warships – or have fallen short of their target. So, they failed to inflict considerable damage on Eilat or other parts of Israel. That is largely owing to the fact that the projectiles were being fired from about 2,000 km (1,240 miles) away. Despite considerably upgrading their projectiles in recent years, it appears the Houthis decided that focusing on firing directly at Israel would offer limited gains. They appear to have adopted a strategic shift since last month, instead focusing on vessels much closer to their shores that remain vulnerable and can be targeted directly within a much more comfortable range. Theystill hold a ship they seized last month, and have launched several other maritime attacks prior to the attacks on Sunday – which marked their largest maritime strikes yet. They also claimed to have downed a US drone last month. As multiple ships were targeted simultaneously by the Houthis on Sunday for the first time, the US military said it would “consider all appropriate responses”, without going into detail. “These attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security,” it said in a statement. “They have jeopardised the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world.” Israel and the US have so far chosen not to directly attack Yemeni soil, and that will likely remain the case. Yemen hasjust emerged from a warthat lasted more than seven years and failed to remove the Houthis, who fought a coalition led by Saudi Arabia that was supported by Washington before President Joe Bidenpulled the US outand reversed a “terrorist” designation for the group. As Israel is also fighting Hezbollah on its border and Iran-backed forcescontinue to trade fire with the US in Syria and Iraq, Israel and its Western allies seem reluctant to further expand the scope of the war.",Published On 4 Dec 2023
Is­rael or­ders evac­u­a­tions as on­slaught on Gaza widens,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/4/israel-calls-for-evacuations-as-it-widens-offensive-on-gaza,"The Israeli army’s assault is pushing further into the south of Gaza, leaving Palestinians little chance of safety. Israel has ordered Palestinians to evacuate several more areas as it widens its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, killing hundreds. The Israeli military declared on Monday via the social media site X that it was defining “safe areas” for Gaza civilians to minimise harm to them. However, hundreds more Palestinians have been killed since the onslaught resumed on Friday, and it is unclear where civilians might seek safety. Al Jazeera journalists on the ground say it is difficult to heed the orders in real time, with nowhere safe remaining in the enclave. Israel published a map on Friday, dividing Gaza into “evacuation zones” and asking people to follow their announcements for their safety. However, the maps, which include nearly 2,500 grids, have confused many, while unreliable internet and electricity make keeping updated a challenge. On Monday, an update with three arrows pointing south was issued. The instruction came the day after the Israeli military said it had expanded its ground operation to all of Gaza, targeting “Hamas centres in all” of the enclave. The renewed bombardment follows the end on Friday of the seven-day pause in thefightingbetween Israeli forces and Hamas fighters, which had allowed an exchange of about 105 Israeli and foreign hostages held by Hamas for 240Palestinian prisoners. More than 15,500 people have been killed, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, in nearly two months of warfare that broke out after a Hamas cross-border raid on southern Israel on October 7 in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and about 240 taken hostage. Intense air raidsovernight killed more than 100 Palestinians, according to the Hamas authorities. That raises the death toll in Gaza since Saturday to more than 800. Israel has also stepped up attacks on the city of Khan Younis in the south, which was previously designated as a safe area, leading thousands of displaced Palestinians to flee to the city. “This comes as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes and have been displaced,” said Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem. “While the Israelis are chalking up battle plans for the southern part of the Gaza Strip, the reality is that there is no safe place in Gaza at the end of day 58 of this war. “It is worth noting that the Israeli military has not shown huge military achievements or accomplishments, but rather what we have seen is a dire humanitarian catastrophe that has unfolded inside of the Gaza Strip.”  This is a modal window.

Israeli security forces also continued their raids in the occupied West Bank overnight and early on Monday morning. They targeted the cities and towns of Ramallah, Jenin, Silwad, Jaffna, Jalazoun, Qalqilya and Hebron, arresting dozens of people, according to the Palestinian Wafa news agency. Palestinian officials told Al Jazeera that at least two Palestinians were killed in the morning during an Israeli army raid in Qalqilya in the north. Israeli army radio confirmed that two “gunmen” were killed and one wounded following a raid in the city. Local sources told Al Jazeera that both bodies were taken away by the Israeli forces. Reporting from Hebron, Hoda Abdel-Hamid said it is a common practice and that Israeli authorities are holding the bodies of 25 Palestinians killed in raids since October 7. More than 3,500 people have been arrested, she added, and the majority are being held without charges. A total of 256 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October 7, including six prisoners who died in Israeli custody.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Nether­lands ac­cused of war crimes com­plic­i­ty for Is­raeli mil­i­tary sup­plies,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/4/court-to-hear-case-against-the-netherlands-over-israeli-jet-parts-shipments,"Human rights groups say the Dutch state’s export of plane parts to Israel makes it complicit in Gaza war crimes. A Dutch court is set to hear a case accusing the state of complicity in war crimes in Gaza due to its supply of components for Israeli bombers. Launched by human rights organisations against The Netherlands, the case, which opens on Monday, says that the Dutch state is complicit in the alleged war crimes due to the export of F-35 fighter jet parts. The Dutch branches of Amnesty International and Oxfam, argue that “the Netherlands is contributing to wide scale and serious violations of humanitarian law by Israel in Gaza” by allowing shipments of reserve parts for Israeli fighter jets while the war continues. The court case will start at 10am CET (09:00 GMT) and will hear the claimants’ case and a response by lawyers for the Dutch state. A ruling is expected in two weeks. The Netherlands is home to a regional warehouse which stores US-owned F-35 parts, which can be sent on to other F-35 partner countries, such as Israel. Several weeks after the deadly October 7 Hamas attacks, the Dutch government allowed a shipment of reserve parts for Israeli F-35s, government documents show. Last week, the country’s Defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren told Dutch news agency ANP that she would not comment on the allegations prior to the legal proceedings at the court in The Hague. But later, in a letter to parliament, the Dutch Ministry of Defence said that based on the current information, “it cannot be established that the F-35s are involved in grave violations of the humanitarian laws of war”. Israel has denied committing war crimes in Gaza. More than 15,000 Palestinian people including women and children, have been killed in the besieged Gaza Strip as the war continues to rage. Israel says Hamas fighters have killed 1,200 Israelis and taken 240 captive. Like the rest of the European Union, since the onset of the war between Israel and Gaza, the Netherlands has maintained that Israel has the right to self-defence, in line with humanitarian and international law. The Dutch government has not joined calls for a ceasefire that have been heard from some EU peers, such as Belgium and Spain. ",Published On 4 Dec 2023
Pho­tos: No end to suf­fer­ing of Gaza chil­dren as Is­raeli at­tacks rage on,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/4/no-end-to-suffering-of-gaza-children-as-israeli-attacks-rage-on,"In Pictures More than 6,600 Palestinian children have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 7, the government’s media office says. Thousands more are missing under the rubble amid relentless bombardment, it added. On Friday, Catherine Russell, executive director of the United Nations Children’s Fund, warned that Gaza is once again “the most dangerous place in the world to be a child”, following the resumption of the war. Russell said hundreds of children will die each day if violence returns to the scale and intensity seen before the seven-day pause in fighting that ended on Friday. “It does not have to be this way. For seven days, there was a glimmer of hope for children amidst this horrific nightmare,” Russell said in a statement. About half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million is below the age of 18. Many Palestinian minors in Gaza have been traumatised by war, with some having experienced five Israeli assaults since 2008. The study conducted by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics before the war began on October 7 found that 13 percent of children and minors aged five to 17 suffer from anxiety. The bureau estimated that about 52,450 children and minors are expected to suffer from stress in 2023, while 13,000 could suffer from signs of depression. But the numbers are expected to rise exponentially because of the October 7 war, the statistics bureau said. The Defence for Children International-Palestine, an NGO, said in early November that Israeli forces killed twice as many Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip in October as the total number of Palestinian children killed in the occupied West Bank and Gaza combined since 1967. More than 15,500 people have been killed in the besieged Palestinian territory in more than eight weeks of combat and heavy bombardment, the Ministry of Health says.",Published On 4 Dec 2023

Israeli maps and AI do not save Palestinian lives, writes Professor Marc Owen Jones. Read more about why he believes so inthis opinion piece.  We will soon be closing this live page. Here’s a recap of today’s key events. Palestinian photographer Tariq Dahlan has shared a video showing the challenges Gaza-based journalists face amid a new telecommunications blackout in the territory. In the video, authenticated by Al Jazeera’s Sanad verification unit, several journalists and photographers are seen on the roof of a building in Khan Younis in southern Gaza to try to connect to the Internet. Watch below.  Israeli forces have deployed more than 50 armoured vehicles and four bulldozers as the military raids the city of Jenin and the Jenin refugee camp in the north of the West Bank, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Wafa also reported gunfire being exchanged near Jenin’s Nazareth Street. A reconnaissance plane was seen flying over the city during the raid, according to Wafa, adding that several Israeli snipers were also positioned on the roofs of several houses and buildings. Several neighbourhoods in Jenin and within the camp also experienced power outages during the raid. We’ll bring you more on this situation when we can. The number of displaced people arriving at Nasser Medical Complex continues to increase, with new shelters being set up in the facility’s car park and many people sleeping on the ground in the open. The hospital in Khan Younis, where teams from Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) provide surgical care to patients with trauma and burn injuries, has also seen a constant influx of new patients, pushing its capacity to breaking point. “The hospital has been receiving multiple severely injured patients nearly every hour,” said Chris Hook, MSF medical coordinator in Khan Younis. “With the situation as it is in the hospital – there is no available space any more – it really is a terrible situation. Everyone is genuinely worried about what will come next.” See the full photo galleryhere. Reporting from Ramallah, occupied West Bank The issue of settler violence is ubiquitous across the occupied West Bank. People here in Palestine describe settlers, often reservists or former Israeli military, as kind of shock troops for the Israelis here, backed up by active duty Israeli soldiers in attacking, consistently, constantly, belligerently, harassing Palestinian communities across the occupied West Bank. The issue of settlers is so intrinsic, so penetrative in all of these areas, it has turned the map of the occupied West Bank. It has become a kind of archipelago of islands surrounded by illegal settlements. And those cases often turn deadly. We heard a report just a couple of days ago of an armed Israeli group of settlers attacking one village in the occupied West Bank. One man was shot. He was chased by the settlers. He ducked into an olive grove, hid behind a vehicle. And hours later, after the dust settled, his family went looking for him and found he bled out behind the car where he was hiding.  The Palestine Red Crescent has shared a video showing its emergency crews responding to Israeli attacks on Gaza once night falls. Watch below.  Russia’s emergencies ministry said that 120 Russian nationals evacuated from Gaza flew to Moscow today, Reuters reports. A statement from the ministry said that 30 children were on board the chartered evacuation flight and that so far, more than 880 Russian citizens have been flown home on board nine flights. The WHO has warned that Israel’s intensifying military ground operations in southern Gaza, “are likely to cut thousands off from health care”. “As more civilians in southern Gaza receive immediate evacuation orders and are forced to move, more people are being concentrated into smaller areas, while the remaining hospitals in those areas run without sufficient fuel, medicines, food, water, or protection of health workers,” it said. In a statement, the UN agency also said:  The US Central Command says 15 rockets were fired from Iraq towards the US base Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria on Sunday afternoon. “There were no injuries to personnel or damage to equipment,” it said, adding that “a fuel truck modified to launch up to 20 rockets was located at the site” of the firings. Washington says dozens of attacks have been carried out against US and allied forces in Syria and Iraq since the war in Gaza began.    ",Published On 4 Dec 2023
Qatar calls for in­ter­na­tion­al probe into ‘Is­raeli crimes’ in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/3/qatar-calls-for-international-probe-into-israeli-crimes-in-gaza,"Qatar’s prime minister says the country will continue efforts towards facilitating another truce and reaching a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Qatar’s prime minister has said his country is calling for an “immediate, comprehensive and impartial international investigation” into what he called Israeli crimes in Gaza. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani also told Al Jazeera on Sunday that Qatar would continue its efforts towards facilitating another truce and reaching a permanent ceasefire in the besieged enclave. A week-long Israel-Hamas truce – brokered by Qatar with the support of Egypt and the United States – led to the release of 80 Israeli captives in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. The truceendedon Friday, with both sides trading accusations of violating the conditions of the deal.

According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, 15,523 Palestinians have died in the enclave since the war began on October 7 – more than 70 percent of them women and children. Meanwhile, the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, called on Israel and Hamas to abide by international law, saying his office will ramp up investigations into potential war crimes. “All actors must comply with international humanitarian law. If you do not do so, do not complain when my office is required to act,” Khan said on Sunday as he wrapped up his four-day visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank. Khan stressed his visit was “not investigative in nature” but said he was able to speak to victims on both sides of the conflict. “Credible allegations of crimes during the current conflict should be the subject of timely, independent examination and investigation,” he said. Set up in 2002, the ICC is the world’s only independent court set up to probe the gravest offences including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It opened an investigation in 2021 into Israel as well as Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups for possible war crimes in the Palestinian territories. Khan also called for humanitarian aid to immediately be let into Gaza, adding that Hamas must not misuse such aid. “On humanitarian access, the law does not allow for doubt,” he said. “Civilians must have access to basic food, water and desperately needed medical supplies, without further delay, and at pace and at scale.” He previously said thatblocking the delivery of aidto Gaza could also constitute a war crime under the ICC’s jurisdiction.

Yemen’s Houthis say they tar­get­ed two Is­raeli ships in Red Sea: Re­port,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/3/yemens-houthis-say-they-targeted-two-israeli-ships-in-red-sea-report,"Pentagon meanwhile says a US warship and multiple commercial ships also came under attack, potentially marking a major escalation. Yemen’s Houthi movement says it has targeted two Israeli ships with an armed drone and a naval missile, reports a spokesperson for the group’s military. The spokesperson said the two ships, Unity Explorer and Number Nine, were targeted after they rejected warnings from the group’s navy, the Reuters news agency reported on Sunday. British maritime security company Ambrey said a bulk carrier ship had been hit by at least two drones while sailing in the Red Sea. Another container ship reportedly suffered damage from a drone attack about 101km (63 miles) northwest of the northern Yemeni port of Hodeida, it added. The Pentagon also said a US warship and multiple commercial ships came under attack in the Red Sea, potentially marking a major escalation in a series of maritime attacks since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7. “We are aware of reports regarding attacks on the USS Carney and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and will provide information as it becomes available,” the Pentagon said.

A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, told the Associated Press the attack began at about 10am in Sanaa, Yemen (07:00 GMT), and went on for about five hours. Last month, the Houthis seized a vehicle transport ship also linked to Israel in the Red Sea off Yemen. The rebels still hold the vessel near the port city of Hodeida. Missiles also landed near another US warship last week after it assisted a vessel linked to Israel that had briefly been seized by gunmen. However, the Houthis had not directly targeted the Americans for some time, further raising the stakes in the growing maritime conflict. In 2016, the US launched Tomahawk cruise missiles that destroyed three coastal radar sites in Houthi-controlled territory to retaliate for missiles being fired at US Navy ships, including the USS Mason, at the time.",Published On 3 Dec 2023

At least 700 Palestinians have been killed in the past 24 hours – one of the highest daily death tolls since the war began on October 7. From the north to the south, Palestinians in Gaza say nowhere is safe. The Israeli military targeted the Jabalia refugee camp for a second day. Several homes were destroyed, killing dozens of people. More are buried under the rubble. Israel has also called on residents from certain neighbourhoods in Khan Younis in southern Gaza to evacuate. Roads leading to other parts of the city or further south have been destroyed or heavily damaged. More than 15,500 people have been confirmed killed in Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

How a Pales­tin­ian teen’s re­lease ex­posed Is­raeli mis­treat­ment of pris­on­ers,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/3/how-a-palestinian-teens-release-exposed-israeli-mistreatment-of-prisoners,"Israel claimed 18-year-old Mohammed Nazal was healthy when leaving prison, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Israeli officials were displeased when Mohammed Nazal, an 18-year-old Palestinian, described his ordeal in Israeli prisons after being released as part of atruce agreement with Hamaslast week. The teenager from the town of Qabatiya in the occupied West Bank told Arab and Western media how he was beaten and denied medical assistance, but this was refuted by Israeli authorities who tried to paint him as a liar. His testimonies and medical records have now been verified by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency, Sanad, providing further evidence of the brutal mistreatment Palestinians suffer in Israeli prisons that has only exacerbated since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7. Arrested in August and held without charge, Nazal was among more than 100 Palestinians kept in Israeli prisons – many arbitrarily – and released as part of a weeklong truce that ended on Friday. After his release, he was interviewed by various news outlets, including Al Jazeera, todiscuss his time in Israeli prison. He said prison guards grew significantly more violent after the war started. “He kept beating me for eight minutes with a stick and without caring where it lands,” he told Al Jazeera of how an Israeli guard tortured him. “I was covering my head. The stick was aimed here, at my head, but my hands would receive the blow.” Images of Nazal with both hands held up by bandages – and his account of the ordeal – went viral. He said both hands suffered fractures and several fingers on both hands were broken. He may need surgeries on his road to recovery. Nazal said he was “in pain on the floor for a week” in prison after the beatings, but was offered no medical assistance before his release was secured in a captive exchange. Nazal was only able to talk about his experiences after he was united with his family by the Red Cross. But after his account got out, Israeli officials sprang to action. Ofir Gendelman, a media official in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, released a video that showed Nazal did not have his hands bandaged when boarding a Red Cross bus. That, he said, meant that his hands “were fine”. And he claimed this shows how Palestinians lie about what happens in Israeli prisons. This is whileIsrael’s propaganda tacticsand unfounded claims have been repeatedly laid bare publicly more than ever during the war.  So, is there any proof of the “war zone” Nazal experienced in Israeli prisons, where Palestinians are said to be living in inhumane conditions? The young man isnot the first Palestinian to come forwardwith such accounts. Many of the Palestinians who were released this week presented the media with similar accounts of torture, beatings and humiliation. Practices in Israeli prisons have been thoroughly documented over a long time,as they have been ongoing for decades, ever since its occupation of Palestinian territories began in 1967, and even before, during the British control of the territory. But Nazal has proof as well. Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency, Sanad, has analysed medical records issued by Nazal’s doctors on the day of his release. The records indicate that he had fractures on the metacarpal bones – the flat bones at the back of the hand. X-rays of the teenager’s hands, taken on the day of his release on November 28, also confirmed several fractures, corresponding with results found by a medical centre in Ramallah. Photos of Nazal after release also showed how he displayed considerable signs of bruising on his back. The teenager’s medical records were also examined and verified by Misbar, an Arab fact-checking platform, in addition to media outlets including the BBC.  Like thousands of other Palestinians, Nazal was held under “administrative detention”. It’s a practice, supported by Israeli law, that allows Palestinians to be jailed for six months without charge or trial. That time span can be repeatedly extended for an indefinite period. In addition to the physical abuse, rights groups have reported that the Israel Prison Service has taken other measures against Palestinian prisoners since the start of the war. It has reportedly restricted access to water, food, medical care and communal items for prisoners, and has restricted or completely stopped family and lawyer visits. It has also allowed prisoners to be put on mattresses on prison floors to enable already overcrowded prisons to take in more inmates. Child inmates have also been documented to experience the same dire conditions as adults, and many of them go through Israeli military courts.",Published On 3 Dec 2023
‘Death cor­ri­dor’: The al-Samou­nis re­call ter­ror of ‘safe pas­sage’ in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/3/death-corridor-the-al-samounis-recall-terror-of-safe-passage-in-gaza,"Three brothers belonging to al-Samouni family were kidnapped by the Israeli army on ‘safe corridor’ leading south of Gaza City. Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip –It’s been two weeks, and the al-Samounis still have no idea what happened to their sons and brothers. They are in shock. The 36 women and children, crammed into one tent for displaced people on the grounds of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, have four blankets to share among themselves. They used to live in Zeitoun, in the southeast of Gaza City, where they farmed their 69 dunams (17 acres) in peace, they said. But from the first day of Israel’s assault on Gaza, October 7, they were forced to flee south, and decided to take what the Israeli army said was a “safe corridor”: Salah al-Din, the main road that runs north-south in the Gaza Strip. But the corridor was not so safe after all. Zahwa al-Samouni, 56, could barely talk when she recounted how the Israeli soldiers took her three sons away. The family were walking on the road, trying not to fixate on the bodies of dead Palestinians on the ground, when they reached a newly erected Israeli checkpoint. Before the family could pass through the turnstiles, the soldiers ordered Abdullah al-Samouni, 24, to step to the side of the road, in a trench hidden from view. His younger brother Hamam, 16, started calling for Abdullah, visibly distraught. The soldiers ordered Hamam to join his brother. The oldest brother, Faraj, a farmer and father of six, shouted at the soldiers, asking them where they were taking Abdullah and Hamam. His protest resulted in the soldiers commanding him to join his brothers. The rest of the family, stunned, made their way through the turnstiles. “When we passed the checkpoint, I saw two men stripped to their underwear in the trench with numbers marked on their shoulders,” Zahwa said. “There were other men, and I could make out my son Faraj.” Her sister-wife Zeenat, who is Abdullah and Hamam’s mother, said she informed the Red Cross of the brothers’ names, ID numbers and mobile phone numbers. “Every day that goes by is like a year for us,” she said. “I sit by the entrance of the tent hoping someone will have news of them. I just want to know what happened to them, if they’re OK, if they’re alive.” The mother of seven had taken the so-called safe corridor three days before her sons and stepchildren. She had been staying at a relative’s house, then tried staying at a school shelter, but the bombings became too intense. “We were afraid, but we decided to take the risk because we knew other people who managed to reach south,” the 49-year-old said. “We walked past our land, and we saw so many Israeli tanks there and all our homes destroyed.” Zeenat and her family raised white flags and their IDs in front of the Israeli snipers. “We walked with our hearts about to jump out with fear, starting from nine in the morning,” she said. “When we finally got to Deir el-Balah, the sun was setting.” She said she had seen children’s torn limbs among the bodies on the road. Zahwa said that when she made the same trek three days later, Israeli soldiers told them anyone who stopped moving at all or looked back would be shot. “They jeered at us as we passed the checkpoint,” Zahwa said. “They swore at us in Arabic, using the most foul words, and cursed our prophet Muhammad and God. They called us Hamas supporters, and promised to finish us off when we go south.” She gripped her face, tears streaming down her cheeks. Her granddaughter and namesake, 10-year-old Zahwa, recalls the events of that day. “We were walking, my parents and two brothers and three sisters, and when we got to the checkpoint the Israelis took my dad and uncles,” she said, speaking with a clarity beyond her years. “My dad [Faraj] was holding my hand, and the Israelis took him from me,” she said, pain etched on her face. “The soldiers also took the bag that had our clothes in it. Just clothes, not bombs or weapons,” she scoffed. The younger Zahwa said the Israeli soldiers shot a man in front of them and did nothing as he bled to death. “The man had learning disabilities,” she said. “He was walking in a line and looked back. The soldiers told him to look straight ahead, and as he turned his head they shot him in the stomach.” “This is not a safe corridor, it’s a death corridor. It’s a corridor of fear,” she added. “They killed people, they beat them, and they made them take off their clothes.” The horrors that the al-Samouni clan experienced are the latest in a series of traumas that began during the 2008-2009 Israeli offensive when soldierskilled 48 of their family membersin Operation Cast Lead. The army had corralled several families under one roof and fired missiles at the house, killing dozens. Some people managed to get out, waving white flags, but when the Red Cross was granted permission to enter the building three days later, they were met with the harrowing sight of 13 injured people, including eight children, who spent days without food or water, surrounded by the bodies of their parents and relatives. One of those killed was Zahwa’s husband, Attiya. Their daughter Amal, who is Abdullah’s twin sister, was only eight at the time but remembers everything in vivid detail. “That cold January day, 100 Israeli soldiers raided our home and killed my dad in front of us,” the 24-year-old said. “They first threw a grenade at the entrance of the house, engulfing us in smoke.” The soldiers shouted in Hebrew for the homeowner to step forward. Attiya, who had worked previously in Israel, raised his arms and identified himself. “They shot him between the eyes, then in the chest,” Amal said. “Then they kept shooting, riddling his body with bullets.” Earlier, as the tanks surrounded their home, Attiya had taught his children to say in Hebrew “We are children”, but it made no difference. “After they shot my dad they began firing at us,” Amal said. “Abdullah and I were both wounded. They set a fire in one of the bedrooms, and we were suffocating from the smoke.” Hamam was barely a year old at the time. Their brother Ahmad, four years old at the time, was shot twice in the head and in the chest and was left to bleed to death until dawn the next day, as the Israeli army prevented any ambulances from reaching the area. Ahmad died in his mother Zahwa’s arms. She had lost her husband, her son, and her home and in the 15 years since that fateful day, the family had to work twice as hard to rebuild their lives. Faraj was at the centre of it all. He immediately took on the role of the man of the house with no complaints and helped raise his younger siblings. He was a farmer, and very handy. He built his home with his own hands and, despite their modest background, refused any charity. “He was a pillar we all relied on,” his mother Zahwa said. “He was so caring, and with him around we never had to beg for anything.” His daughter Zahwa can’t sleep at night, wondering whether her dad is dead or alive. “I want him back,” she sobbed. “He’s my rock; without him I am nothing. I miss holding his hand, I miss giving him hugs.”",Published On 3 Dec 2023
UK to start Gaza sur­veil­lance flights to lo­cate cap­tives held by Hamas,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/3/uk-to-start-gaza-surveillance-flights-to-locate-captives-held-by-hamas,"British officials say ‘unarmed and unmanned drones’ will conduct surveillance flights in efforts to recover captives from Hamas. The UK’s military will conduct surveillance flights over Gaza to help locate captives held by Hamas, according to the British Ministry of Defence, joining the US in backing Israel in its war against the Palestinian armed group. Hamas fighters seized about 240 Israelis and foreign captives during their October 7 attack, according to Israeli authorities. Israel says 110 have since been freed – 86 Israelis and 24 foreigners – in exchange for some 240 Palestinian prisoners, mainly during a recent weeklong truce thatendedon Friday. Israel’s military said on Friday it had resumed bombardment of the besieged Palestinian territory. It blamed Hamas for the end of the truce that brought respite to people in Gaza from weeks of devastating bombing. The resumption of combat has frustrated hopes for the swift release of the about 130 captives the Israeli army has said are still being held in Gaza. The UK has said at least 12 British nationals were killed in the October 7 attacks – in which Israeli officials say about 1,200 people died, mostly civilians – and that a further five are still missing. London has not confirmed how many of its citizens are being held by Hamas. Israel responded to the October 7 attack by vowing to eliminate the Hamas group and its subsequent relentless air and ground campaign has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to the authorities in Gaza. Hamas has stated that it will continue negotiations on the release of further captives only after the end of the Gaza war, while Israel withdrew from the talks mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States.

Britain did not reveal when its military surveillance flights over the territory would start but stressed they would be unarmed and focused only on the captive recovery efforts. “In support of the ongoing hostage rescue activity, the UK Ministry of Defence will conduct surveillance flights over the Eastern Mediterranean, including operating in air space over Israel and Gaza,” it said in a statement. “Surveillance aircraft will be unarmed, do not have a combat role, and will be tasked solely to locate hostages,” the ministry added. “Only information relating to hostage rescue will be passed to the relevant authorities responsible for hostage rescue.” UK government minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC on Sunday that the aircraft to be utilised were “unarmed and unmanned drones”. Alongside the United States, the UK in October deployed various military assets to the Eastern Mediterranean to deter “any malign interference in the conflict”. That included maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft as well as a Royal Navy task group moving to the region, the Defence Ministry said at the time. Britain’s defence exports to Israel were 42 million pounds ($53m) last year, according to Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, who has said that London has no plans to stop arms sales to the UK. Meanwhile, the White House, the largest supplier of arms to Israel,aimsto lift nearly all restrictions on Israel’s access to weapons from the US. If granted by lawmakers, the request would enable Israel to access more high-powered US weapons at a reduced cost, with less congressional oversight. A report by The Wall Street Journal recently said that Washington gave so-called‘bunker buster’ bombsand an array of other munitions to Israel for its war on Gaza. The US hastransferred100 BLU-109 bombs to Israel that are meant to penetrate hardened structures before exploding, the report said, quoting unnamed US officials. Washington has also promised $14bn in aid to Israel – its closest ally in the Middle East – in addition to the $3.8bn annual military assistance.",Published On 3 Dec 2023
Over 700 killed in last 24 hours as Is­rael in­ten­si­fies strikes,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/3/over-700-killed-as-israel-pounds-gaza-widens-evacuation-orders,"The Israeli army has ordered more people to evacuate from southern Gaza, which was earlier declared ‘safe zone’. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air raids in the past 24 hours in Gaza as the Israeli army ordered more areas in and around the enclave’s second-largest city of Khan Younis to evacuate. The Director General of the Government Media Office in Gaza told Al Jazeera on Sunday that more than 700 Palestinians have been killed since Israel resumed bombardment after a seven-day truce ended on Friday. More than 1.5 million people have been displaced, most of them from northern Gaza, since Israel launched a military offensive on October 7 in the wake of a deadly Hamas attack. Overnight and into Sunday, intense bombing was reported in Khan Younis, Rafah, and some northern parts targeted by Israel’s air and ground attacks. “Everywhere you turn to, there are children with third-degree burns, shrapnel wounds, brain injuries and broken bones,” James Elder, UNICEF’s global spokesperson, told Al Jazeera from Gaza. “Mothers crying over children who look like they are hours away from death. It seems like a death zone right now.” The main hospital in Khan Younis received at least three dead and dozens wounded on Sunday morning from an Israeli air raid that hit a residential building in the eastern part of the city, according to an Associated Press journalist at the hospital. Separately, the bodies of 31 people killed in Israeli bombardment across the central areas of the strip were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Gaza’s central city of Deir el-Balah, said Omar al-Darawi, an administrative employee at the hospital. In northern Gaza, rescue teams with little equipment scrambled on Sunday to dig through the rubble of buildings in the Jabaliya refugee camp and other neighbourhoods in Gaza City in search of potential survivors and dead bodies. Hopes of any future cessation in the fighting were dashed on Saturday when Israel announced it was pulling out negotiators from the Qatari capital, Doha, saying talks had reached an “impasse”. Israel has said it is working to eliminate the armed Palestinian group Hamas, which launched deadly attacks on southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking more than 240 captives, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has killed more than 15,200 Palestiniansin Gaza attackssince October 7, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The Israeli military on Sunday expanded evacuation directives in Khan Younis and the vicinity, urging residents from at least five additional areas to relocate for safety purposes. Leaflets distributed by the military instructed residents to move south to Rafah, or a coastal area in the southwest, emphasising that Khan Younis was a “dangerous” combat zone. Rights groups have raised concerns against Israel’s stepped-up attacks in the southern part of the besieged enclave, which was earlier declared a “safe zone”. Following an Israeli air raid on an eastern residential building, the main hospital in Khan Younis reported at least three deaths and dozens of injuries on Sunday morning, according to an AP journalist. A significant portion of the 2.3 million inhabitants in the territory now resides in the southern areas due to the war. Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, a 21-year-old Palestinian was shot dead on Sunday by Israeli forces in a raid in Qalqilya. According to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society, Israel arrested at least 60 Palestinians in overnight raids in the occupied territory. The latest arrests add to more than 3,000 Palestinians arrested in the West Bank since October 7, according to the UN Human Rights Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

"An­gered by Biden’s stance on Is­rael, US Mus­lims pledge to ditch him in 2024",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/3/us-muslims-pledge-to-ditch-biden-in-2024-over-his-stance-on-israel-gaza-war,"Muslims in key states launch #AbandonBiden campaign over US president’s refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Muslim American leaders in several pivotal states pledged on Saturday to rally their communities against President Joe Biden’s bid for re-election due to his steadfast backing of Israel’s war in Gaza. The #AbandonBiden campaign began when Minnesota Muslim Americans demanded Biden call for a ceasefire by October 31, and has spread to Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. “This #AbandonBiden 2024 conference is set against the backdrop of the upcoming 2024 presidential election and the decision to withdraw support for President Biden due to his unwillingness to call for a ceasefire and protect innocents in Palestine and Israel,” the group told US news outletAxiosin a statement. Opposition from their sizable Muslim and Arab American populations could pose a challenge to the president’s Electoral College prospects in the upcoming election. The US president and the vice president are elected by a group of “electors” who are chosen in most cases by political parties in that state.  “We don’t have two options. We have many options,” Jaylani Hussein, director of Minnesota’s Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) chapter, said at a news conference in Dearborn, Michigan, when asked about Biden alternatives. The US politics is dominated by two parties – the Democrats and the Republicans – but independent candidates can also run for president. Former Harvard professor and pre-eminent Black philosopher Cornel West, who is running as an independent candidate, has called for a ceasefire in Gaza and condemned Israel’s occupation of Palestine. Jill Stein, who is in the race on the Green Party platform, has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza. She was a candidate in 2016 as well as 2012. However, the influx of private donations flowing into the US political system means that independent candidates with smaller funding have less chance of electoral success compared with candidates from the two big parties. US and Israeli officials have rebuffed pressure for a permanent halt in fighting, with US Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday echoing Biden saying Israel has a right to defend itself. At least 15,207 Palestinianshave been killedin Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200. According to thelatest datafrom the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Health Organization (WHO) and the Palestinian government, as of November 23, Israeli attacks have damaged more than half of Gaza’s homes. On Friday, Israel renewed itsbombardmentof Gaza following a seven-day truce, targeting refugee camps and leaving remaining hospitals overwhelmed. At least 700 people have been killed in relentless Israeli bombardment in the past 24 hours. Muslim Americans said they did not expect former President Donald Trump to treat their community any better if re-elected, but saw denying Biden votes as their only means to shape US policy. “We’re not supporting Trump,” he said, adding the Muslim community would decide how to interview other candidates. It remains to be seen whether Muslim voters would turn against Biden en masse, but small shifts in support could make a difference in states Biden won by narrow margins in 2020. A recent survey revealed a significant decline in Biden’s backing among Arab Americans, dropping from a substantial majority in 2020 to just 17 percent. This shift could have a crucial effect in states like Michigan, where Biden secured victory by 2.8 percentage points, and Arab Americans constitute 5 percent of the vote, according to the Arab American Institute. Among the general public,opinion pollsshow most Americans back an end to Israel’s war in the besieged enclave.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

"Analy­sis: Is­rael re­sumed bomb­ing Gaza, what has hap­pened since?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/3/analysis-israel-resumed-bombing-gaza-what-has-happened-since,"Do the latest US weapons shipments to Israel hold any clues to how the fighting will go? Fighting in Gaza resumed almost on cue on Friday when thelast extensionof the truce expired and hopes in attempts to renew it again faded. Back in action first were Israeli F-16 bombers, pounding more than 400 targets in Gaza, including some in the very south near the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. However, the focus appeared to be in the north and there is little doubt that the Israeli army will try to advance deeper towards the centre of Gaza City just as Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced: tanks, artillery, armoured bulldozers, then infantry. Meanwhile, contradictory news from Qatar, where intermediaries from the host country, Egypt and the United States were still trying to convince the warring sides to reach another pause. The first announcement on Saturday said the talks were continuing. Then at mid-afternoon, the Israeli prime minister’s office issued a statement: “Following the impasse … David Barnea, head of the Mossad, ordered his team in Doha to return to Israel.” Writing official statements is an art: One should never lie but there is no need to tell the whole truth. While the “official” Israeli secret service delegation may indeed beon its way home, I have no doubt that at least a small team remains in Doha. They may not be Mossad, but it would be foolish not to leave qualified liaison officers who can keep talking. Another reason for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to maintain at least a core team of officials in Qatar would be to avoid straining relations with traditional ally the United States, which has supported Israel greatly in the post-October 7 crisis. US President Joe Biden visited Israel offering Bibi a photo op the cunning veteran of Israeli politics jumped on, splattering the media with their embraces and carefully selected soundbites. Washington followed with massive supplies of military goods, some commercial sales, and others loans. The biggest may be the $14.3bn aid package “for Israel’s defence”. Weapons and armaments have been pouring into Israel by US C-17 aircraft and commercial airlifters practically from October 8. The Washington Post reported that 15,000 bombs and 57,000 artillery shells (155mm) came by air, a figure consistent with the estimated amount of ordnance expended in the eight-week campaign and the carrying capacity of the aircraft. Less urgent supplies will be arriving on less glamourous, higher-capacity ships. As the bombing campaign resumed, the media revealed the types of bombs shipped to Israel, focusing mostly on the specialised heavy “bunker busters”. The report claims that 100 BLU-109 bombs were shipped. Some media speculated that this delivery may signify a change in tactics against the Hamas, but there is nothing to be excited about. The 900kg (2,000lb) BLU-109 is nothing more than a “dumb bomb” with thicker outer walls than general-purpose bombs, that help it penetrate deeper into the earth or through thicker layers of reinforcing concrete before exploding. The corresponding weight class general-purpose MK84 bomb carries 430kg (950lb) of explosives to the “bunker-busters” 240kg (530lb). But the BLU-109, which costs US taxpayers $65,000 apiece versus $16,000 for the MK84, is of little use to Israel as a dumb bomb. To be effective and able to hit targets with precision, it needs to be upgraded with a far costlier laser guidance head unit and a control tail unit. According to the same reports, the US delivered 3,000 such JDAM kits that convert dumb bombs into smart weapons. Apart from 100 bunker busters, US deliveries reportedly included two sizes of general-purpose dumb bombs: 5,400 MK84s – 900kg (2,000lb) – and 5,000 MK82s – 450kg (1,000lb) – and 1,000 precision-guided GBU-39 “small diameter bombs” – 150kg (300lb). Worried about the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of Palestinian targets that could be compared to carpet bombing, the US warned Israel on several occasions to reduce the number of civilian casualties. After the resumption of bombing on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Israel that “the massive levels of loss of civilian life and displacement scale we saw in the north must not be repeated in the south”. He allegedly received Israeli assurances that they would try to kill fewer civilians, but the casualty toll in the first 24 hours of renewed fighting, with nearly 200 reportedly killed in the bombardment, leaves little room for optimism. Can anything about the intentions of the next stage of aerial bombardment be determined from the numbers and types of bombs delivered to the Israeli army? First, there is no reason to put too much importance on the delivery of 100 bunker busters. Israel already had those in its arsenal and used some, so this may be a simple replenishment or a modest build-up. While long and sometimes deep, Hamas tunnels are mostly not covered in thick layers of concrete, so Israel would need just a handful of bunker busters. Second, one could compare the number of conventional bombs delivered, 10,400 of two different weight classes, with the number of JDAM kits, 3,000. Along with the transfer of 1,000 small but precise “small-diameter bombs”, these figures may suggest that one in every three or four bombs dropped in future might be “smart” and that Israel would be making an effort to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza, as it allegedly promised the US. Such a conclusion would be premature. Without knowing the number of dumb bombs and smart kits that were in Israeli warehouses and bases before October 7, a top military secret, the ratio of precision-guided bombs versus dumb ones that indiscriminately destroy civilian infrastructure and kill non-combatants, cannot be made and it will take several more days to establish whether there is any change in the way targets on the ground are attacked.",Published On 3 Dec 2023

Is­rael-Gaza war up­dates: 100s killed in last 24 hours in Is­raeli strikes,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/12/3/israel-gaza-war-live-israel-bombards-gaza-as-talks-break-down,"This live page is now closed. For the latest live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, follow alonghere. We will soon be closing this live page. Here’s a recap of today’s key events: reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank We’re hearing of raids in villages around Jenin where Israeli vehicles that were carrying out raids there were targeted with pipe bombs. There are confrontations north of Tulkarem. We’re also hearing of ongoing raids in Qalqilya. At least 60 people were detained throughout the course of today. Sixty detentions a day in the occupied West Bank – in raids and at checkpoints – has become a daily average. The number of raids is going up in intensity and frequency since the beginning of the war with most of these actions carried out at night under the cover of darkness. The Israeli strike hit a residential building in the al-Tanour neighbourhood, east of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, resulting in multiple deaths, according to exclusive information and video footage obtained by Al Jazeera and verified by the Sanad news agency. Several people were also injured in the strike that hit the building belonging to the al-Jazzar family in al-Tanour. Images seen by Al Jazeera showed widespread destruction from the shelling as well as the search and rescue effort carried out by civil defence staff and residents of the area. Often described as the world’s biggest open-air prison, most of the world only pays attention to Gaza when it is firing rockets at Israel. It’s a tiny territory with no control of its own borders or airspace. Most of its residents are refugees from just across the boundary with Israel who have almost no chance of ever leaving.  A US air strike killed five Iraqi fighters near the northern city of Kirkuk as they prepared to launch explosive projectiles at US forces in the country. The Reuters news agency quoted three Iraqi security sources confirming the raid, identifying the dead as members of an Iran-backed militia. A US military official confirmed a “self-defence strike on an imminent threat” that targeted a drone staging site near Kirkuk. A statement by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group representing several Iraqi armed factions with close ties to Tehran, said five of its members had been killed, and pledged retaliation against US forces. Iraqi armed groups have claimed more than 70 such attacks against US assets since October 17 over Washington’s backing of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza.  This is a modal window.

Palestinian citizens in Israel grapple with rising threats and restrictions following the events of October 7.  Hamas has denounced the United Kingdom for planning to conduct surveillance flights over the Gaza Strip, calling it a partner in Israel’s war. The UK carrying out surveillance flights over Gaza to help locate Israeli captives makes it a “participant in the war”, Hamas said in a statement, according to Arabic media reports. The UK’s defence ministry confirmed on Saturday that the military will be conducting surveillance flights over Gaza. Osama Hamdan, a Lebanon-based Hamas official, accused Israel of pursuing a deliberate strategy of luring Gaza civilians south to trap and kill them there. “It has become clear that the occupation’s claim … of the existence of safe areas in the south of the Gaza Strip, and its constant call for citizens to go there, was a premeditated plan and trap to commit more massacres against unarmed civilians and displaced people in the south,” he told reporters. The Israeli military ordered Palestinians to evacuate several areas in and around Khan Younis City. It posted a map highlighting shelters they should go to west of Khan Younis and south towards Rafah, on the border with Egypt. But many residents said areas they were told to go to were also under attack.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

Pho­tos: More deaths and de­struc­tion as Is­rael tar­gets south­ern Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/2/photos-more-deaths-and-destruction-as-israel-targets-southern-gaza,"In Pictures Israel has carried out deadly bombardments in Gaza for a second day after a weeklong truce with Hamas collapsed despite international calls for an extension. Clouds of grey smoke from the strikes hung on Saturday over Gaza, where the Hamas-run Ministry of Health said nearly 200 people had been killed since the pause in hostilities expired early on Friday. Residents feared the latest bombings presage an Israeli ground operation in the south of the Palestinian territory that would pin them into a shrinking area and possibly try to push them into Egypt. The southern part of Gaza, including Khan Younis and Rafah, was pounded by Israeli war planes and artillery on Saturday. Thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering there because of fighting in the north. Residents said houses had been hit and three mosques destroyed in Khan Younis. Palestinian witnesses said Israeli tanks had taken up positions near the road between Khan Younis and Deir el-Balah. “A night of horror,” said Samira, a mother of four. “It was one of the worst nights we spent in Khan Younis in the past six weeks since we arrived here. … We are so afraid they will enter Khan Younis.” Officials said the overall death toll in Gaza since the October 7 start of the Israel-Hamas war has surpassed 15,200 while more than 40,000 people have been wounded in the Israeli attacks.",Published On 2 Dec 2023
Is­rael pulls Mossad ne­go­tia­tors from Qatar af­ter ‘im­passe’ over cap­tives,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/2/israel-pulls-mossad-negotiators-from-qatar-after-impasse-over-captives,"Hamas says there will be no further prisoner exchange with Israel until the war on Gaza is over. Israel has pulled its Mossad negotiators from Qatar, which along with Egypt and the United States is mediating talks to secure a renewed pause in the Israel-Hamas war. “Following the impasse in the negotiations and at the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, David Barnea, head of the Mossad, ordered his team in Doha to return to Israel,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Saturday. The statement accused Hamas of not fulfilling its side of an agreement to extend the truce in Gaza. The deal had included the release of all women and children held in Gaza in accordance with a list conveyed to Hamas and agreed upon, the statement said. Hours later, Hamas said there will be no further prisoner exchange with Israel until the war on Gaza is over. “Our official stance is there will be no further prisoner swap until the war ends,” deputy head of the group, Saleh al-Arouri, told Al Jazeera. “Israeli prisoners will not be released until our [Palestinian] prisoners are liberated and after a ceasefire comes into effect.” “What we have left of Israeli prisoners are soldiers and civilians serving in the army,” he added. The Hamas official said the group was ready to exchanges the “bodies of dead Israelis in exchange for our own martyrs, but we need time to exhume these bodies”. “The Israeli occupation insists that we are still holding women and children but we have already released them all,” he said. Reporting from Doha, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem said: “Given the fact that the demands now are changing, the Israelis are demanding that Hamas should release women soldiers.” “To Hamas, that has a different price,” he said, referring to the previous agreement of three Palestinians prisoners released for every captive held in Gaza under the weeklong truce that ended early on Friday. “The main issue is also that Hamas was from the beginning offering all for all – the Israeli captives for all the Palestinian prisoners in Israel. “Now, we are facing this deadlock with the Israelis withdrawing. This doesn’t mean that negotiations are coming to an end. There may be another mediation and new ideas from different parties,” he said.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

The humanitarian pause saw the release of 80 Israeli captives in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Israel and Hamas have traded blame over the truce’s collapse. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said France is “very concerned” by the resumption of violence in Gaza as he landed in Qatar on Saturday to help kick-start a new truce.​​​ Macron said at a press conference at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai that the situation required the doubling-down of efforts to obtain a lasting ceasefire and the freeing of all captives. He also urged Israel to clarify its goals towards Hamas. “We are at a moment when Israeli authorities must more precisely define their objectives and their final goal: the total destruction of Hamas – does anyone think it is possible? If this is the case, the war will last 10 years,” he said. “There is no lasting security for Israel in the region if its security is achieved at the cost of Palestinian lives and thus of the resentment of public opinion in the region. Let’s be collectively lucid,” Macron added. Asked for a response to those remarks, Mark Regev, senior adviser to Netanyahu, told reporters Israel does not want to see Gaza civilians caught in the crossfire as battles resume. “Israel is targeting Hamas, a brutal terrorist organisation that has committed the most horrific violence against innocent civilians. Israel is making a maximum effort to safeguard Gaza’s civilians,” Regev said. But the civilian death toll continues to mount in the enclave. At least 100 Palestinians were killed by Israeli air strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the strip on Saturday. Rescuers used their bare hands to dig through rubble in search of survivors. Palestinian authorities said at least 240 people have been killed since the bombings resumed early on Friday. Fadel Naim, chief doctor at al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, said his morgue has received 30 bodies since Saturday morning, including seven children. “The planes bombed our houses. Three bombs, three houses destroyed,” Nemr al-Bel, 43, told the Agence France-Presse news agency, adding that he had counted 10 dead in his family and “13 more still under the rubble”. The United Nations estimated at least 1.7 million people in Gaza – 80 percent of its population – have been displaced since the war began on October 7. Since then, the Israeli campaign in Gaza has killed more than 15,000 people, most of them civilians. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200.  This is a modal window.

Pho­tos: ‘Hell on Earth’ as Is­rael strikes hit Deir el-Bal­ah in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/2/hell-on-earth-as-israel-hits-deir-al-balah-in-central-gaza,"In Pictures Israel’s attacks on Gaza have stretched into a second day after a seven-day truce with Hamas ended as Qatar and Egypt mediate talks to renew a pause in hostilities. The United Nations said on Saturday that the fighting would worsen the extreme humanitarian emergency in Gaza. “Hell on Earth has returned to Gaza,” said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office in Geneva. “Today, in a matter of hours, scores were reportedly killed and injured. Families were told to evacuate, again. Hopes were dashed,” UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said, adding that children, women and men of Gaza had “nowhere safe to go and very little to survive on”.

"Is­rael, Pales­tine and Cana­da’s ‘schiz­o­phrenic for­eign pol­i­cy’",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/12/2/israel-palestine-and-canadas-schizophrenic-foreign-policy," Montreal, Canada -More than a month into its bombardment of Gaza, the Israeli military issued awarning: Ground troops had surrounded the largest hospital in the Palestinian enclave, al-Shifa. A raid would be launched “in minutes”. The impendingsiegeof the Gaza City health complex sparked panic among the thousands of injured patients, medical staff and displaced Palestinians sheltering there. But amid urgent international pleas to protect Gaza’s hospitals, much of the focus in Canada was on the tougher tone of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “I have been clear: The price of justice cannot be the continued suffering of all Palestinian civilians. Even wars have rules,” Trudeausaidin a news conference on November 14, around the time the al-Shifa raid began. “I urge the government of Israel to exercise maximum restraint,” he continued, offering his toughest comments since the war began. For weeks, Trudeau had been ignoring calls - and some of Canada’s largest protests in recent memory - demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. “The world is watching. On TV, on social media, we’re hearing the testimonies of doctors, family members, survivors, kids who’ve lost their parents. The world is witnessing this. The killing of women and children - of babies; this has to stop.” The response from Tel Aviv was swift. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted publicly to Trudeau’s speech, arguing on social media that the Palestinian group Hamas, not Israel, was responsible for any civilian casualties. Netanyahu pointed to Hamas’s attacks in southern Israel on October 7, one of the events that precipitated the war. Pro-Israel lobby groups in Canada echoed that argument, saying “the blood of dead babies - Israeli and Palestinian - is on Hamas” and accusing Trudeau of fuelling anti-Semitism. In the days that followed, Canadian ministers sought to temper Trudeau's comments. “The prime minister, quite understandably, is concerned about innocent lives on both sides of that border,” Defence Minister Bill Blair told the Canadian network CTV. “We've also been crystal clear: Israel has the right to defend itself.” The episode is one of many examples in recent weeks of what observers have described as Canada’s “schizophrenic” foreign policy when it comes to Israel and Palestine. “Whenever [Trudeau] does show any mettle with respect to this, he invariably then steps back from what he said after any sort of criticism coming from either the Israel lobby in Canada or Israeli leaders,” Michael Lynk, a former United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, told Al Jazeera.  Unlike its powerful neighbour and Israel’sforemost backer, the United States, Canada says it aims to tread the middle ground in its policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It supports a two-state solution, opposes illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and says international law must be respected by all parties. But experts say Canada has two policies when it comes to the conflict: one on paper and one in practice. They note that Canada has cast UN votes against its own stated positions andopposedPalestinian efforts to seek redress at the International Criminal Court, and argue that it has backed hardline, Israeli policies and failed to hold the country accountable for rights abuses. “This government, as well as previous Canadian governments, have unfortunately had a blind spot with respect to Israel,” said Farida Deif, Canada director at Human Rights Watch. She added that Canada’s stance has not changed despite the nearly two-month-long military campaign in Gaza, where bombs have struck hospitals,refugee campsand schools serving as shelters. More than 15,200 Palestinians have been killed. “What we’ve seen with respect to Canada’s policy on Israel-Palestine is really a lack of coherence, confusion, and essentially not really engaging with the reality on the ground,” she told Al Jazeera. “And the reality on the ground that we’ve seen - that Palestinian organisations, Israeli organisations, international organisations have documented - is the reality ofapartheidand persecution.” So what drives Canada’s position? Al Jazeera spoke to nearly a dozen human rights advocates, politicians, former officials and other experts about how foreign and domestic calculations influence Ottawa’s stance - and whether public outrage could shift its strategy.",Published On 2 Dec 2023
"First aid trucks en­ter Gaza since end of truce, re­newed Is­raeli strikes",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/2/first-aid-trucks-enter-gaza-after-post-truce-holdup-as-israeli-bombs-fall,"Aid organisations say they face difficulties operating as Israel resumes its bombardment of Palestinians in Gaza. A limited number of aid trucks has managed to enter the besieged Gaza Strip through Egypt after being forced into a holding pattern since aweeklong truce endedand Israel started bombing the enclave again. “The Palestine Red Crescent crews have now received aid trucks through the Rafah crossing from our partners in the Egypt Red Crescent,” PRCS confirmed in a post on X on Saturday. The PRCS said it received 50 aid trucks through the Egypt-controlled crossing containing food, water, relief assistance, medical supplies and medicine. The aid trucks had been unable to enter since Friday when theIsraeli military restarted bombingGaza targets, killing hundreds of Palestinians.  No aid convoys or fuel deliveries had entered Gaza since 6pm (16:00 GMT) on Friday, and aid convoys ready to enter Gaza hadremained on the Egyptian side of the border, according to the United Nations. Before the truce that came into effect eight days ago, fewer than 100 trucks were passing into Gaza each day. About 200 trucks entered every day for the duration of the truce. That is compared with the 500 trucks of aid that were entering the Gaza Strip every day before the war started on October 7, according to the UN, which has said the current flow of aid is no match for the needs of civilians in Gaza. The main difficulty in getting the trucks inside Gaza lies with an Israeli checkpoint that has been established as part of a system since October 21, when thefirst aid deliveries started to be allowed in. The system allows Israel to painstakingly vet every single truck to assuage purported concerns that the humanitarian assistance will find its way into the hands of Hamas. It obligates drivers to take a round trip of more than 80km (50 miles) from Rafah to a crossing on Egypt’s border with Israel and back, whichhas caused significant bottlenecks. There, the trucks are thoroughly scanned and searched for anything Israel might deem unfit to enter Gaza – including small kitchen knives.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Hisham Mhanna of the International Committee of the Red Cross told Al Jazeera on Saturday that thecontinuing fighting in Gazahas made it difficult for aid agencies to operate. “There should be a complete ceasefire so that the humanitarian aid can help alleviate, even if slightly, the suffering of civilians,” he said, adding that political efforts were needed to ensure a collapse of the humanitarian sector in Gaza could be prevented. The UN has lobbied for Israel to open the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing near Rafah which used to handle large quantities of goods before the war, but Israel has refused. “Humanitarian operations within Gaza have largely halted, except for services within shelters and limited distributions of flour in areas south of Wadi Gaza,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its latest report on Saturday. “The evacuation of wounded people and dual nationals to Egypt, and the return of Gazans stranded in Egypt, have also stopped.” On Saturday, the Ministry of Health announced that the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza has risen to 15,207, a majority of them women and children, since the war started on October 7. More than 40,000 people have been wounded in the attacks, it said, adding large numbers of them will die every day due to a lack of treatment options in Gaza hospitals.  This is a modal window.

‘I miss my rou­tine’: A dis­placed Gaza moth­er re­calls life be­fore the war,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/my-life-before-the-war-imtithals-story,"Imtithal, forced to leave her home, talks to Al Jazeera about the precious family moments she misses most. Maghazi refugee camp, Gaza Strip –As Imtithal, a mother of six, stokes the wood fire she has built up to bake bread for her family, her thoughts take her back to her usual morning routine at home in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood in western Gaza, before the relentless Israeli bombardment began on the enclave on October 7. Imtithal and her family were forced to flee to the Maghazi camp in the centre of the Gaza Strip after Israeli forcesordered civilians to evacuatenorthern Gaza and move south in the early days of the war. She and her family could see that there was a grave danger that the Israeli bombing could wipe out entire areas in north and west Gaza. She is thankful that they did. Soon after they left, their house was badly damaged in a bombing on their neighbourhood. “My house was severely damaged due to a violent Israeli bombing next to it,” Imtithal says. “Our neighbour, Saleem, who works for the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, sent me videos showing the extent of the destruction that befell my house. I feel very sad and do not know whether it is fit for habitation after today or not.” To cope with the worry, Imtithal takes comfort in the memories of her safe, normal routine before the war began. She would wake up at dawn for Fajr prayers. Then, she would wake her younger children, Hammoud, 13, and Nour, 16, to get ready for school. “I always enjoyed making their breakfast and lunch boxes. I would make sure I put their favourite foods in there,” she remembers. The morning’s work would be far from over yet. “Then, it’s time for my husband and older sons to go to work,” she says. “I make their coffee, but my daughter, Aseel, likes fresh juice, so I make that too while we talk about my plans for the day.” Once they were all fed, ready to go and, finally, out of the door, it would be Imtithal’s “me time”. “I go to the gym and spend about two hours exercising with my friends,” she says. After that, she would go home to drink something hot with her neighbour, Sarah. Next, Imtithal says, she prepares lunch, spends a bit of time reading books on the sciences of the Quran, and logs on for her religious lessons through an academy that she joins via Zoom. Finally, it would be time for the familiar family chaos to begin again. “After my children return from their schools and work, I spend quality time with them, listening to their stories, following up on schoolwork with my son, Hammoud, and then preparing him to go to the boxing club, which he enjoys spending time in.” Imtithal used to call her son Adham, who lives in the United States, every day to check in on him as well. But, since the bombing began, she has been unable to communicate with him much. Israel’sblockadeon fuel means electricity and the internet have been severely restricted – often non-existent – in the Gaza Strip. She has barely managed a few minutes with him on the phone every few days. Once such a normal, sometimes even mundane, part of her day, these are the things Imtithal says she longs for now. “I miss being at home and quietly practising my simple daily routine. “Daily household tasks were not as arduous as they are today. Now, I wash the laundry in buckets with very small amounts of water when I used to use an automatic washing machine. I also struggle to prepare food due to the lack of cooking gas, so we resort to cooking food over a wood fire now.” Imtithal adds: “The situation in Gaza is tragic. I cannot communicate with my sisters, nor can I visit them. I used to go out for walks with them constantly. Even the entertainment places we used to go have all been bombed.” Imtithal worries terribly about the family and friends she has been separated from in her community. Israeli planes bombed her cousin’s house, killing her. She says: “I couldn’t even say goodbye to her! I can’t leave the refugee house I’m in. Her family couldn’t even hold a funeral for her, and they told me that they took her to bury her using their own car.” She also worries greatly about the toll this war is taking on her family. “Everything is exhausting us. What is happening in Gaza is genocide. I miss the spirit of my young son. I am keen to take care of his mental health due to the harsh situation in the Gaza Strip. I find him sitting alone a lot, so I try to make him relax and listen to everything that is on his mind and try to reassure him.” (This account was written by Imtithal’s daughter, Aseel.)",Published On 2 Dec 2023
Is­rael bombs hun­dreds of tar­gets in Gaza as truce ef­forts con­tin­ue,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/2/israeli-bombs-hundreds-of-targets-in-gaza-as-truce-efforts-continue,"The renewed violence enters a second day with Gaza’s health authorities reporting almost 200 dead due to Israeli attacks. Israel’s attacks on Gaza have stretched into asecond dayafter a seven-day truce with Hamas ended, as talks continue with the Palestinian group to renew a pause in hostilities under the mediation of Qatar and Egypt. The city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where thousands of civilians moved from the north of the enclave, came under intense bombardment on Friday, when the weeklong truce expired, and intensified on Saturday. Clouds of grey smoke from the strikes hung over Gaza, where the Hamas-run Ministry of Health said more than 190 people had been killed and hundreds were wounded in renewed Israeli bombardment. Israel said its ground, air and naval forcesstruckmore than 400 targets in Gaza in its latest attacks. It also called on people to evacuate fromKhan Younisas it expands its military operations, urging them to move southwards towards Rafah, close to the border with Egypt. Each of the warring sides blamed the other for the truce collapse by rejecting terms to extend the daily release of hostages held by Hamas fighters in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The United Nations said the fighting would worsen the extreme humanitarian emergency in Gaza. “Hell on Earth has returned to Gaza,” said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office in Geneva. “Today, in a matter of hours, scores were reportedly killed and injured. Families were told to evacuate, again. Hopes were dashed,” said UN aid chief Martin Griffiths, adding that children, women and men of Gaza had “nowhere safe to go and very little to survive on”. A pause that started on November 24 had been extended twice and Israel had said it could continue as long as Hamas released 10 hostages each day. But after seven days – during which women, children and foreign hostages were freed – mediators failed to find a formula to release more. Israel accused Hamas of refusing to release all the women it held. A Palestinian official said the breakdown occurred over female Israeli soldiers.  This is a modal window.

Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary in Deir el-Balah in Gaza said Israeli tanks have not stopped shelling the enclave and the gunboats are attacking the coastline of the Strip. “It was very tough last night with people in Gaza describing it as one of the toughest, as there has been non-stop bombardment in the last 24 hours,” she said. “Houses have been targeted. At least three mosques were hit. Areas across the Gaza Strip – the north, south and centre, have all been targeted.” Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas after an October 7 rampage in which it says the group killed about 1,200 people and took 240 hostage. Israeli assaults since have laid waste to much of Gaza, ruled by Hamas since 2007. Palestinian health authorities deemed reliable by the United Nations say more than 15,000 Gazans, including 6,150 children, have been killed and thousands are missing. Qatar, which has played a central mediating role, said negotiations were continuing with Israelis and Palestinians to restore the truce, but Israel’s renewed bombardment of Gaza had complicated matters. Israel says its priority is to get as many hostages released as possible as it puts military pressure on Hamas. Officials say Hamas released 110 hostages during the truce – 86 Israelis and 24 foreigners – in exchange for a total of 240 Palestinian prisoners. At the same time, Israel detained almost as many Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

US officials told The Wall Street Journal newspaper that Washington provided Israel with large “bunker buster” bombs, among tens of thousands of other weapons and artillery shells, to help dislodge Hamas from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has informed several Arab states that it wants to carve out a buffer zone on the Palestinian side of Gaza’s border to prevent future attacks, Egyptian and regional sources, quoted by the Reuters news agency, said. The report said that Israel related its plans to its neighbours Egypt and Jordan, along with the United Arab Emirates, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020. There has also been a renewed escalation of hostilities on Israel’s Syrian and Lebanese borders after the truce in Gaza ended. Syrian air defences repelled an Israeli rocket attack against targets in the vicinity of Damascus early on Saturday, according to Syrian state media, which added that most of the missiles were shot down. Separately, casualties were reported in southern Lebanon, with Lebanon state media reporting that Israeli shelling killed three people on Friday. The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, said two of those killed were its fighters. It added it had carried out several attacks on Israeli military positions at the border.

"Near Rafah bor­der, baby dies and aid held up again as Is­rael’s war re­sumes",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/near-rafah-border-baby-dies-and-aid-held-up-again-as-israels-war-resumes,"One of the 28 premature Gaza babies moved to Egypt from al-Shifa Hospital is dead. And trucks with aid for Gaza must wait again. Hundreds of trucks carrying aid for Gaza were lined up in a long queue at the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing. Drivers and volunteers, many of them waiting for more than a week at the border, were having their lunches on carpets next to the trucks in the evening sunlight on Thursday. A car passed by to sell bread and cigarettes. The border gate opened every now and then to letempty trucks through, returning from the Gaza Strip. Truck driver Ahmed Naim Ibrahim has been one of the first in line. On Thursday, no trucks were let in, Ibrahim said, due to congestion on the other side of the border. After entering the Rafah crossing, trucks first have to drive 40km (24 miles) south along the border towards the Al-Owga crossing between Egypt and Israel, Ibrahim explained. There, the Israelis inspect the trucks, after which they return to Rafah. Only then can the trucks unload the aid that is being delivered to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. From the moment a truck moves into the Rafah border crossing it takes two or three more days for the aid to be distributed in the Gaza Strip, Ibrahim said. “There is a line of 20km (12 miles) before the Israeli inspection,” he added. Another driver, Saleh Ebada, agreed. “The inspection takes time, this is what causes the delay.” The trucks driven by Ebada and Ibrahim carry medicines, food, water, blankets and shrouds to cover the deceased. “We are here because we want to support our brothers in Gaza,” said Hazem Mohamed, a volunteer for the Egyptian charity organisation Resala, which has 21 trucks waiting in line at the border. He is frustrated about the long wait. “Every day we are supposed to go in, but every time they postpone it to the next day,” he said. “But it is not in our hands. It is our duty to help, and the least we can do. Waiting for eight days is nothing compared to what those in Gaza are going through.” Ibrahim and other drivers had hoped that they would be able to cross on Friday, but as the ceasefire ended,no trucks were let in. During the truce, the number of trucks entering the Rafah border increased from fewer than 100 to about 200 per day, but many of these are still stuck at the Israeli inspection. UN officials have said that, on average, 500 trucks used to enter the Strip daily before October 7, when Israel started its bombardment. Trucks can be turned back to Egypt if the Israeli inspectors find “forbidden” things, drivers said. One, named Taha, said that for instance, small kitchen knives, scissors and gas canisters were not allowed. Israeli officials have said their checks are needed to ensure no weapons are being smuggled in for Hamas. There are also X-rays on the Egyptian side of the border, to check the trucks before they enter the Rafah crossing. One volunteer explained that Egypt wants to make sure the trucks do not carry things Israel would block, in order to prevent any problems. Besides aid, the Rafah border crossing has been a pathway for more than 9,000 people to leave Gaza in recent weeks. According to official numbers in Egypt, 8,691 foreign or dual nationals entered the country between November 1 and November 29, including the period of the truce. In the same period, 389 wounded Palestinians and 328 other people accompanying them also arrived in Egypt. They are being treated in a field hospital near the border in Sheikh Zuweid and in hospitals in El Arish and other cities in Egypt. Among the Palestinians allowed to leave Gaza were28 premature babieswho were in al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City before it was taken over by Israeli forces. Of the 28 babies, 16 were first taken to El Arish General Hospital 45km (28 miles) from Rafah, while the remaining 12 were moved to Cairo. But a doctor at El Arish hospital said on Thursday that one of the 16 babies at the facility had died. Six were taken to Cairo, while the remaining nine are in good condition. “They are healthy and growing,” the doctor said, who requested to remain anonymous as he was not the official spokesperson of the hospital. Still, their future remains uncertain, as they are in Egypt without family. Many have no surviving direct family members, and it is unclear who, and where, their remaining relatives are, the doctor said. “Until we find them, they stay in the hospitals.” One of the adult Palestinians treated in El Arish General Hospital is Rasha Elwan. Her legs were crushed by falling debris when an Israeli air strike hit her house in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. She was taken to El Arish on November 21. “When I arrived here it was more comfortable. I am a little calmer here,” she said. Before being taken to El Arish, she was in Nasser hospital in the Gaza Strip. “In Gaza, the situation is disastrous. It was very difficult, there were a lot of wounded in the hospital. The doctors did not have time for all of us.” In El Arish she underwent an operation, and doctors told her she might need another one. “Maybe I have to stay another two weeks in the hospital here, and afterwards I could go to Cairo to continue treatment,” she said. She hopes to stay in Egypt, but her family is still in Gaza. “My son died, and my husband is in a hospital in Gaza, he did not come here yet.” Doctors at the hospital said that once the wounded are released, the diplomats from the mission of the Palestinian Authority in Egypt take care of them. There is a place in El Arish where the recovered Palestinians can stay for at least as long as the fighting continues. No one has been returned to Gaza, one doctor said, “only those who died”. It is unclear what would happen to the wounded Palestinians in Egypt, and whether Elwan could stay in Egypt, if the fighting in Gaza were to stop.",Published On 2 Dec 2023
"Is Is­rael crim­i­nal­is­ing Pales­tin­ian thoughts too, amid Gaza war?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/2/is-israel-criminalising-palestinian-thoughts-too-amid-gaza-war,"What Palestinians in Israel read or watch on social media could get them into legal trouble. Following the October 7 Hamas attack, Israel has been clamping down on pro-Palestinian sentiment within its borders, including passing an amendment to its counterterrorism law that has been criticised for violating civil and human rights. Much has changed for Jews and Palestinians living inside Israel since the Hamas attack, which killed about 1,200 people, and the subsequentdevastation wrought by Israel on Gaza, which has killed more than 14,500 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Here’s a look at the amendment and how it will affect people living inside Israel: Israeli politicians began debating a temporary amendment to the counterterrorism law adding “consumption of terrorist materials” as a new criminal offence shortly after the war began. The Knesset, the Israeli parliament,passed the amendment to the lawon November 8 that criminalises “identification” with Hamas and ISIL (ISIS) and carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison. The amendment will be in effect for two years, with the option to extend and add other groups to the list at a later date. The bill outlines the aim of tackling the phenomenon of“lone-wolf terrorism”, or the radicalisation of individuals not affiliated with any group through consuming content online. Nareman Shehade Zoabi, a lawyer at Adalah, an Israel-based human rights organisation and legal centre, told Al Jazeera it is difficult to tell the severity of the implications of the new law, given its vague nature and the difficulty of understanding what precisely “consumption” means under the law. “However, this vagueness, together with the exceptions stipulated in the law, clearly reveals the intent to target Palestinians in particular,” she said. “What is extremely concerning is that, in recent days, we have seen the law enforcement authorities in Israel constantly lowering the standard for what can be defined as ‘incitement to terror’ – one form of content prohibited in the law – which has resulted in dozens of outrageous indictments.” Criminal investigations for such offences usually involve the use of “intrusive tools of surveillance against individuals”, Zoabi said. “We fear that this move is intended to further expand the state’s ability to lock up Palestinians as a means of silencing them.” Others have criticised the amendment as well. The Tel Aviv-based Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) said the law “remains unprecedented in democratic countries and may have a chilling effect on freedom of expression”. Haifa-based Adalah called it “one of the most intrusive and draconian legislative measures ever passed by the Israeli Knesset, since it makes thoughts subject to criminal punishment”. Gur Bligh, a Knesset legal adviser, said the law is not as draconian as critics claim. It includes a provision requiring law enforcement officials to establish that the accused identifies with banned groups. That, Bligh said, will help avoid “excessive criminalisation”. But others disagree. Adalah has called it “one of the most intrusive and draconian legislative measures ever passed by the Israeli Knesset, since it makes thoughts subject to criminal punishment”. There had been reports of people being arrested – and mistreated while detained – for their online activity, including posting on Instagram and liking Facebook content, soon after the war and even before that amendment was passed. But Israel’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian sentiment has gone much further. There have been reports of dozens of cases of Palestinian students enrolled in Israeli universities and colleges facing disciplinary action – and sometimes expulsion – over any expression of support for Gaza or raising awareness aboutPalestinian children being killed by Israeli operations. Rights groups have also reported instances of Palestinians there losing their jobs and being hit withdemotions or suspensionsin various sectors, including retail, tech, hospitals and private companies, over support for other Palestinians. Aban has been imposedon pro-Palestinian and anti-war demonstrations. Lawyers have been warned by the Israeli Bar Association not to publish content online that may be perceived as “incitement to violence”. Members of the Knesset who represent Palestinian political parties have been pressured and threatened with expulsion. Earlier in November, Israel deported thousands of Palestinian workers from the Gaza Strip who were working inside Israel back to the besieged enclave. They had been abruptly detained without judicial process, having had their work permits revoked, andsaid they were tortured and insultedin prison. The overwhelming majority of crackdowns taking place in Israel following the war have been targeted at Arabs, specifically Palestinians, living in Israel. But Jewish citizens of Israel have not been spared. There have been reports of Jewish Israeli activists being targeted by right-wing mobs with what appears to be at least a tacit approval by the state. Shabak, the security services of Israel, is conducting so-called warning talks with Israeli citizens who have spoken or posted online about anything that could be construed as support for Gaza or criticism of the war. Since the start of the war, Israelmore than doubled its number of Palestinian prisonersand conditions in Israeli prisons have significantly deteriorated. Reports and testimonies indicate that Palestinian prisoners have lost a number of limited privileges – like televisions, books, family photos and cooking slabs – that they had gained over decades of struggle, including through hunger strikes. Rights groups have reported that the Israeli Prison Service (IPS) has considerably restricted access to water, food, medical care, family and lawyer visits, and communal items, is ordering more raids resulting in prisoner beatings, and overcrowding prisons by increasing cell capacities. The Knesset on October 18 approved an amendment to its “prison ordinance” that effectively allows for the overcrowding of prison cells as the Israeli government arrests more Palestinians. The amendment legally allows those suspected or convicted of national security-related offences to be placed on mattresses on prison floors. It was passed as a temporary measure and is slated to remain in effect for three months unless extended. It effectively allows Israeli prisons to take in more inmates even if they are already at full capacity. Earlier this month, the Israeli Ministry of Interior said it aims to introduce amendments to the counterterrorism and citizenship laws to authorise the revocation of permanent residency or citizenship of an individual who has been convicted of a “terrorism-related” offence. Israeli media reported on Tuesday that Sports Minister Miki Zohar has requested revocation of citizenship for Ataa Jaber, an Israeli footballer who plays for the Palestinian national team, because he observed a minute of silence during a match against Lebanon last week. Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, one of themost hardline figuresin what was already Israel’s most far-right administration under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even before the war, is believed to be a main driving force behind the crackdowns. Ben-Gvir was convicted in 2007 – when he was a far-right activist – by a Jerusalem court for “incitement to racism” for carrying signs that, among other things, read “expel the Arab enemy” during demonstrations. Along with other officials, the minister has been a driver of a policy to significantly increase the number of Israeli civilians who are armed. Days after the Hamas attack, he announced loosening gun controls to allow thousands of assault rifles to be doled out to civilian teams, especially in border towns. Adalah’s Zoabi noted that since the war began “the most extreme right-wing ministers and lawmakers have been taking advantage of collective feelings of fear and vengeance to advance various measures that entrench Jewish supremacy in Israel”. “Such measures include efforts to make substantive changes on the ground, like the forcible displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, the arming of Jewish civilians, and the redefinition of the limits of rights and liberties of Palestinians through legislation and governmental policies,” she said. “These steps are especially alarming when the courts do not make the pretence of curbing the attack on Palestinian rights.”",Published On 2 Dec 2023
"US sends ‘bunker buster’ bombs to Is­rael for war on Gaza, re­port says",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/2/us-gives-bunker-buster-bombs-to-israel-for-war-on-gaza-report,"Apart from ground-penetrating munitions, US has also given Israel several other types of bombs and artillery shells. The United States has given so-called‘bunker buster’ bombsand an array of other munitions to Israel for its war on Gaza, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. Washington has transferred 100 BLU-109 bombs to Israel that are meant to penetrate hardened structures before exploding, the report said, citing unnamed US officials. The bomb carries a warhead weighing more than 900 kilogrammes (19,80 pounds) and has previously been used by the US in conflicts including the war in Afghanistan. It is not the only type of ammunition provided by the US to Israel for the war on the besieged enclave, which has so far killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, including at least 6,150 children. The October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that started the war killed 1,200 people. Unlike the regular arms updates by the US about the war in Ukraine, the Pentagon has remained mostly silent on its level of weapons support for Israel amid international condemnation of Israeli military operations in Gaza. The WSJ report said a surge of US arms to Israel since the start of the war has included 15,000 bombs and 57,000 155mm artillery shells that have primarily been carried on C-17 military cargo planes. Washington has also sent more than 5,000 unguided Mk82 bombs, more than 5,400 Mk84 bombs, about 1,000 GBU-39 small-diameter bombs, and approximately 3,000 JDAMs, a guidance kit that turns unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, it said. This is on top of the billions of dollars Israel receives each year in US financial support for its military operations. According to the WSJ, large bombs made by the US have been used in some of the deadliest Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, including a strike thatlevelled an apartment block in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing more than 100 people. Israel said the attack was justified as it killed a Hamas leader. Israel’s intense aerial bombing of Gazarestarted shortly after the end of a weeklong truceon Friday that saw dozens of captives held in Gaza exchanged for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Many dozens of Palestinians have already been killed less than 24 hours after the strikes resumed. The Israeli army, which has repeatedly been telling Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza amid its ground operations, said on Saturday that parts of southern Gaza are also a battle zone now. People on the ground and rights groups have repeatedly said there is no safe place in Gaza. Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro said the report on the delivery of heavy-duty penetration bombs to Israel has raised new questions about continued US arms transfers to the country. “These are major bombs that the US has used in the past in its wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, but mainly in open areas … Now Israel is using these bombs in a very different environment in Gaza, on a densely populated civilian population,” Zhou-Castro said. “Many people are now questioning in Congress whether continuing to give these ‘bunker bombs’ is a good idea and also calling for more transparency,” she said. The penetration bombs could theoretically be used to target the tunnels that Hamas uses to move around personnel and munitions. However, the tunnels are located under a densely populated urban area, which would mean using the bombs would lead to many more civilian casualties. The US has fully backed the Israeli war efforts in the face of growing international pressure for a total ceasefire. Washington has repeatedly said it has asked Israel to try to limit civilian casualties, even as itlay siege to Gaza’s main hospitals.",Published On 2 Dec 2023
"Is­rael’s war on Gaza: List of key events, day 57",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/2/israel-hamas-war-list-of-key-events-day-57,"Israel’s renewed attacks kill dozens of Palestinians in Gaza amid mediating efforts led by Qatar to re-establish the truce.

The armed wings of Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they fired barrages of rockets and mortars towards various Israeli cities and settlements from Gaza. Gaza is the “most dangerous place in the world to be a child” Catherine Russell, the head of UNICEF said in a presentation to the United Nations Security Council. The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists said 61 reporters have been killed since the start of the war in Gaza – 54 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese. Fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border resumed after the collapse of a week-long truce, with at least three people also killed in southern Lebanon by Israeli fire.  This is a modal window.

United States defence secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington is working diplomatically to restore the truce with Israel, Egypt and Qatar, while blaming Hamas for failing to meet conditions on hostages and for an attack in Jerusalem. Hamas has accused the US of giving a green light for the Israeli “war of genocide and ethnic cleansing”. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he “deeply regrets” that military operations have started again in Gaza.

‘We will nev­er for­get’: Re­liv­ing the pain of the Nak­ba amid Is­rael’s war,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/we-will-never-forget-reliving-the-pain-of-the-nakba-amid-israels-war,"Baqaa, Jordan –Rain pours down in torrents onJordan’s Baqa’a camp, turning the streets into rivers. The November storm’s harsh winds rattle the tin doors of thousands of homes in the largest Palestinian refugee camp in the country. But despite the heavy downpour and bone-chilling cold outside, it is warm inside the Nashwan family’s home. Eighty-six-year-old Abdullah Nashwan beams at his great-grandson, Tayem, just one year old. His three grandchildren smile as they sift through a box of old family photos over a steaming pot of mint tea. Abdullah’s daughter-in-law, Kausar, pulls out a photo of Abdullah and his wife Fatima, who passed away 10 years ago. “I remember her thobe [traditional Palestinian dress]. She always wore it,” Kausar’s 20-year-old son Mohammad recounts. Kausar brings out a long velvet dress from the bedroom. It is worn, but its violet, green, pink and yellow hues are still bright, intricately stitched into a pattern of flowers. When Abdullah sees the dress, he freezes, staring deeply as if his wife had appeared from the fabric’s folds. Like other Palestinian thobes, the embroidered pattern is unique to the woman’s village. For Abdullah’s wife, this is a town called Dawaymeh, high in the hills of al-Khalil (Hebron), in what is today the occupied West Bank. A sharp contrast to the camp, where the thickly packed cement structures suffocate most of the plants, Dawaymeh was very green. Olive groves and expansive gardens were neatly planted on terraces etched into the mountainside, Abdullah recounts. “My father was a farmer,” he says. “We owned a few dunums, where we planted wheat and barley. We lived off the land, and there was plenty to eat and drink. Everything was lovely,” he says. “I wish I could return,” young Mohammad, who wears a black-and-white keffiyeh around his head, says. “I want to see all of Palestine. Not just Dawaymeh, everything.” Abdullah brought his wife and children to Baqaa in 1967. They did not come straight from Dawaymeh, as this was not the first displacement for Abdullah and his wife, but it was the first for the six children. Abdullah’s 57-year-old son, Saadi, Mohammad’s father, grew up in Baqaa. He was four months old when they arrived in the newly established camp, he tells Al Jazeera. “The camp was covered in mud up to here,” Saadi gestures to his knee, remembering how unfinished the infrastructure was when he was a child. Saadi and five of his siblings were born in a refugee camp in Jericho, where his parents had fled as children with their own parents during the Nakba of 1948, when an estimated 750,000 Palestinians were forced to leave their homes and land during the creation of Israel. In 1967, the war between Israel and a coalition of Arab nations led by Egypt, Syria and Jordan ended with Israel in control of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights. The family was uprooted again, like some 430,000 Palestinians, with most fleeing into neighbouring Jordan. Saadi went to school in Baqaa and his father worked as a cook for the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). As the years passed and the tents gradually transformed into concrete homes, Abdullah and his wife had four more children. Today, most of Abdullah’s 10 children have moved out of the camp, to Jordan’s capital city, Amman, and other governorates. But Saadi still lives just around the corner from his father, although life in the camp has not been easy, he says. Tamara Alrifai, UNRWA spokeswoman, told Al Jazeera unemployment and poverty rates are high in Baqaa and budget deficits are threatening the agency’s services, such as education and healthcare. “We are surrounded by hardship. We are refugees, guests here. We don’t have the freedom to express our thoughts,” Saadi says. Abdullah arrived in the Jericho refugee camp as a child of 11 and lived there for more than 20 years, growing into adolescence, getting married and having six children with his wife. He had walked 50km (31 miles) with his family to get there from Dawaymeh in 1948. On October 28, 1948, Zionist fighters approached the village and opened fire with automatic weapons and mortars, according to the mukhtar (village chief), Hassan Mahmood Ihdeib. Some of the 4,304 villagers fled, while others took shelter in a mosque and a nearby cave. When the mukhtar returned to the village to check on them, he found the bodies of about 60 men, women and children in the mosque and the bodies of 85 more in the cave. He recorded a total of 455 people missing. The village was destroyed. In its place now is the Israeli settlement of Amatzya. Abdullah’s family was among those who fled. “We didn’t even take our clothes,” Abdullah explains. There had been no time to gather their belongings. In 2016, an Israeli soldier wrote in the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, about what he had seen in Dawaymeh. He estimated that between 80 and 100 people were killed, including children, by having their “skulls smashed”. Women were raped, then shot. Throughout Palestine, the militias expelled more than 750,000 Palestinians from their villages, destroying homes and killing thousands. The events, mourned as the Nakba (catastrophe in Arabic), were followed by the creation of the state of Israel. During Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, a number of Israel’s far-right politicians have clearly stated that they want a “second Nakba”, stirring up painful memories of massacres like the one in Dawaymeh. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the Israeli bombardment of Gaza a “second war of independence”, referencing what Israelis call the events of 1948. Ariel Kallner, a member of parliament from Netanyahu’s Likud party, wrote on social media: “Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 48. Nakba in Gaza and Nakba to anyone who dares to join!” The images of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza piling whatever belongings they can carry into cars and donkey carts, or on their backs as they trek on foot, are painfully similar to the images Abdullah remembers of the Nakba. With more than 70 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people displaced by Israel’s attacks, this is the largest mass displacement of Palestinians in 75 years. At Abdullah’s home, the television is stuck on the Al Jazeera Arabic channel for hours, broadcasting the immense destruction in Gaza. The TV presenter speaks to a young mother, nursing her child while sheltered in a tent. She holds a piece of bread in her hand and says there is not enough to eat. Saadi says that his father is devastated by the war, the terrible images reminding him of his two-times displacement. “We are watching Palestine fall apart,” Saadi says. However, in the stories ingrained in Saadi’s memory, Palestine is alive and vibrant. Growing up, he says, he would sit beside his father and soak up all his stories. “The land is rich,” he says. “There are no fruits and vegetables anywhere like those from Palestine. “Our homes are Palestinian. Our blood is Palestinian.” Saadi has six children who all still live in Baqaa, and who have absorbed the stories of Palestine. “From the youngest family member, the son of my son, Teem, to the oldest, we don’t forget Palestine,” he says. “And we will never forget.” Saadi’s eldest child, 31-year-old Alaa has three daughters of her own now. “My daughters already know everything about Palestine,” she says. Alaa shows a video of her oldest daughter, seven-year-old Tala in a keffiyeh at a school performance, singing “Filestini ana ismi Filestini” (Palestinian, my name is Palestinian, in Arabic). It resembles an old photo of Alaa when she was about Tala’s age and singing at school. In the photo of young Alaa, she wears the traditional Palestinian thobe, just like her grandmother. Alaa says she teaches her daughters everything her grandmother taught her: the food, the songs, the traditions and the stories. She cooks her daughters the same dish her grandmother, Fatima, used to make for her: kusa with leban (zucchini with yoghurt). “You boil the zucchini, then smash it, then mix it with yoghurt and garlic,” she recounts, explaining how her grandmother used to prepare it. Alaa turns to her two younger daughters, four and six years old, and starts singing “Ya bayy Miriam”, a folk song often sung at weddings, the girls giggle. The three young girls then pull out their drawings of the Palestinian flag. Their mother says they drew for the children of Gaza. “We are destroyed, just like them [in Gaza],” Alaa sighs. Inside Alaa’s grandfather’s home, the television rolls on, showing the expansive displacement camps in Gaza; the white tents lined neatly like those once in Baqaa camp in 1967. When the rain finally slows to a trickle, Abdullah steps outside. The rolling green hills of Abdullah’s childhood werelevelledyears ago, to make space for a new Israeli settlement. But when Abdullah walks into his yard, he remembers. Over the past 50 years, he has built a small garden. Vines with yellow flowers creep above the foyer and bright green, potted plants line the entryway. Abdullah pauses to touch one of the leaves and then bends over to smell the flowers. They remind him of Dawaymeh, he says.",Published On 2 Dec 2023
Q&A: UN ex­pert on Aus­tralia cit­i­zen­ship-strip­ping plan and ‘le­gal fic­tion’,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/qa-un-expert-on-australia-citizenship-stripping-plan-and-legal-fiction,"Al Jazeera spoke to UN expert Ben Saul about politicians’ powers to revoke citizenship in light of a recent Australian court ruling. The Australian Senate is currently consideringlegislationthat would allow government ministers to ask judges to consider removing a person’s citizenship as punishment in certain cases of “serious crimes”. Australia’s centre-left Labor government introduced the proposed legislation this week after Australia’s High Court recentlyruledthat previous legislation giving the Minister for Home Affairs the power to revoke citizenship was invalid. But politicians in Australia are far from the only political leaders who are interested in deciding who should have their citizenship taken away. In Israel, two different ministers have recently called for football players to lose their citizenship, in one case because a player represented Palestine in World Cup qualifiers, and in another case, because players did not hold up a sign when asked. In the United Kingdom, then-Home Secretary Sajid JavidrevokedShamima Begum’s citizenship in 2019 for travelling to Syria to join ISIL [ISIS]. Begum has since failed to overturn this decision in multiple appeals. To better understand the legal and human rights implications of politicians choosing who loses their citizenship, Al Jazeera spoke to Ben Saul, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism.

Al Jazeera: What have recent court decisions meant for citizenship-stripping laws in Australia? Ben Saul:In Australia, the citizenship laws of the previous government relied on a kind of legal fiction that if you committed certain kinds of terrorism that automatically meant that your citizenship lapsed because it was showing disloyalty and lack of allegiance. The courts threw that out a while ago because they said, really an administrative decision has to be made to deprive somebody of citizenship. It can’t just operate somehow automatically when the affected person won’t even necessarily know that they’ve lost their citizenship. The second thing the Australian courts and the High Court, in a series of decisions, have said is that the High Court regards stripping citizenship as a criminal-type penalty or punishment. And, under the Australian Constitution, that’s a power which can only be exercised by a court. So, essentially what the courts have said is that the minister can’t take that decision. Because of the very serious consequences of stripping citizenship, it’s equivalent to a punishment. Therefore, under Australia’s constitution, at least, only a court can impose that kind of further penalty beyond a criminal conviction.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  AJ: How do the Australian court rulings relate to the United Kingdom and, for example, the case of Shamima Begum? Saul:The Australian approach is a highly protective one. So, it does restrict the way in which you can strip citizenship. In other countries, it’s a decision that can be made by a minister but which is then reviewable by a court. Or it’s something where the minister applies to a court, for the court to make a decision, but it’s not necessarily a criminal proceeding, it can be a civil proceeding. So there are a variety of ways of doing it. What’s critical is that the hearing and the process have to be fair. So, security evidence against them has to be properly disclosed so that they can effectively challenge whatever allegations the government is making. And secondly, it has to be reviewed by a court so there has to be some form of judicial protection in that process. The Australian approach goes one step further and says there has to be the protection of a criminal court decision which is a much more robust way of ensuring there are safeguards in place.*** AJ: In Israel, there have been proposals to further expand citizenship-stripping powers. Could the proposed legislation have human rights implications? Saul:Some years ago, Israel introduced citizenship-stripping laws in terrorism cases, but [recent proposed legislation took this] a step further, expanding those laws. One of the key concerns is that the legislation would allow somebody to be made stateless, which is contrary to international law. One of the key restrictions on denationalising people is that you can only do it if somebody has a second nationality, and that nationality is available and effective. What Israel is proposing to do is that you’d lose Israeli citizenship, you’d be potentially deported to, let’s say the West Bank, but you don’t have any other kind of citizenship or nationality. That’s clearly illegal under international law.  AJ: Is it possible for citizenship stripping to be done in a way that follows due process? Saul:Lack of due process has been absolutely a key concern in many countries. Sometimes there have been efforts to strip citizenship by ministers, or at the executive governmental level, rather than by a decision of a court applying a full and fair hearing, allowing the evidence to be tested and getting an independent decision maker in a court to make the decision. If a minister – who is ultimately a politician who is part of the government – is making the decision, that is much more susceptible to political considerations and not necessarily the best way of applying a legal standard. AJ: Was revoking citizenship a common form of punishment historically? Saul:Citizenship stripping is historically pretty rare in laws in most countries. Where it is generally acceptable is if citizenship has been acquired by fraud by somebody. So you’re a foreign national, you come to live in another country, you get citizenship but you’ve done it on false pretences or falsified documents. The other historical kind of category was cases of treason or treachery, where your country is at war with another country and you do something to assist the enemy, which shows a kind of disloyalty to your own country and those are cases in wartime which have sometimes led to a loss of nationality as well. AJ: Is that the case with governments that are charging people with terrorism? Saul:The difference there is that most of the time citizenship in terrorism cases is being stripped where people have committed terrorism against some foreign government or people in a foreign country. So it’s not actually directed towards Australia, to use the example of Australia, and therefore it’s not like there is any disloyalty to Australia as such or enunciation of your allegiance to Australia. AJ: In some ways is charging people with disloyalty or treason something that seems a little bit old-fashioned? Saul:That’s right, and a more modern view is if people have citizenship here and have lived here and have connections here and so on, then it’s the responsibility of our country to deal with the terrorist threat that they may pose. So that could be through criminal prosecution here and putting people in jail if they’ve done something wrong and there are other counterterrorism laws to address any other security threats that they may face. ***[Note: Al Jazeera spoke to Ben Saul before the legislation currently being considered in Australia’s Senate was proposed this week.

How De­moc­rats are alien­at­ing their base by blast­ing a Gaza war cease­fire,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/2/how-democrats-are-alienating-their-base-by-blasting-a-gaza-war-ceasefire,"Advocates say President Biden’s party is committing a ‘major political error’ by vilifying calls for ceasefire in Gaza. Washington, DC –Inexplicable. That is how advocates are describing the actions of some Democratic officials who seem to be not only alienating but actively antagonising members of their own party over differing views on the war in Gaza. Many prominent Democrats, including United StatesPresident Joe Biden, have voiced “unwavering” support for Israel’s military offensive in the Palestinian enclave. But that stance has fractured the Democratic base, with polls showing that a majority of Americans support a ceasefire. That schism was prominently on display in November, when activists held a ceasefire protest outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, DC. Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman responded bycallingthe demonstrators “pro-terrorist”. “Apparently, these pro-#Hamas demonstrators want #Republicans to prevail in the next Congressional election,” he wrote in a social media post. He also accused the activists of attempting to break into the building — an allegation refuted by the protest organisers andjournalistswho were at the scene. The protesters had sought to block an entrance to the headquarters where a reception was unfolding, and police responded by evacuating lawmakers and forcibly dispersing the activists. But advocates say Sherman’s reaction was one of many instances where Democratic politicians have smeared their constituents over the Gaza war, signalling a disconnect with the party’s base. Beth Miller, the political director at Jewish Voice for Peace Action, an advocacy group, called Democrats’ attacks on ceasefire activists “pathetic” and “shocking”. “It’s also a major political error,” Miller told Al Jazeera. She noted that publicopinion pollsshow most Americans — and an overwhelming majority of Democrats — back an end to hostilities in Gaza. AReuters/Ipsos surveyreleased last month indicated 68 percent of respondents believed Israel should call a ceasefire and negotiate an end to the war. That number rose to 77 percent among Democrats alone. “For these members of Congress to not only dismiss it, but to actively attack those people, I think it means that they’re also not reading thepolitical windsof how people will be voting and what they will be demanding in the coming cycle,” Miller said.

The rift between Democratic policy and public opinion has translated into dwindling approval ratings. In October, the Arab American Institute, a think tank, found Arab American support for Biden haddropped 42 percent, reaching an all-time low. That downward trend was reflected in the wider public as well. A recent NBC poll showed that 70 percent of voters under 34 disapproved of President Joe Biden’s handling of the war. Usamah Andrabi, communications director at Justice Democrats, a progressive group, said the Democratic Party is showing itself to be “out of step” with its base as well as the broader electorate. “It is a baffling calculation to see the president and the White House side far closer with Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government in Israel than a majority of his own Democratic voters at home,” Andrabi told Al Jazeera. From the outset of the war, several Democrats, including Biden, have drawn ire for appearing to vilify activists callingfor a ceasefire. Days after the conflict broke out, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre issued a strongly worded response to a question about legislators allegedly “equating the Hamas terror attack” with Israeli actions. Jean-Pierre first asked for clarity about which Congress members had done so. When the reporter identified them as members who “called for a ceasefire”, she said their statements were “wrong”, “repugnant” and “disgraceful”. It was unclear which statements she was referring to, but many activists understood her words to be a condemnation of the progressive lawmakers pushing for an end to the war. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator John Fetterman earned the praise of the far-right publication Breitbart last month for waving an Israeli flag at ceasefire protesters on Capitol Hill. Then came the large pro-Israel protest on November 14, during which top congressional Democrats held hands with their Republican counterparts, including House SpeakerMike Johnson. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer led chants of “I stand with Israel”. The crowd regularly called out, “No ceasefire!” The Biden administration was represented by Deborah Lipstadt, the US envoy to combating anti-Semitism, who delivered a speech. Thepro-Israel rallywas also attended by far-right figures, including Christian Zionist pastor John Hagee, who has been accused of stoking both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. A day after the rally, two White House communications officials Andrew Bates and Herbie Ziskend shared approvingly a Fox News story titled, “Biden allies condemn far-left calls for ceasefire in Israel-Hamas war”. In the article, Democratic lawmakers — including Fetterman and Congressman Ritchie Torres — praised Biden for his support for Israel and admonished those demanding an end to the war as “fringe”. An anonymous Biden administration official quoted in the story criticised the mainstream media for not being critical enough ofRashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American member of Congress. The criticism of Palestinian rights supporters continued this week when Democratic Congressman Brad Schneider gave an interview to Fox News. He called for revoking the tax-exempt status of groups that he claimed are diverting money “into terrorist organisations”, citing — without evidence — the advocacy organisation American Muslims for Palestine. He added that “groups like Students for Justice in Palestine and others should not be getting these tax benefits”.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  Andrabi, from Justice Democrats, understands this kind of rhetoric as corrosive to the relationship Democratic politicians have with their supporters. “What we are seeing is the Biden administration attempting to gaslight the American people into believing that their majority that supports a ceasefire is somehow radical and fringe when the only people who are radical and fringe is the coalition between Netanyahu’s far-right government and the Biden White House,” Andrabi said. He dismissed arguments that the war will not shake Biden’s standing with voters as he seeks reelection in 2024. Foreign policy is seldom a top priority for voters. But advocates say the scale of the violence in Gaza has made it a decisive issue for many constituents. Some United Nations experts have gone so far as to warn of “a grave risk of genocide“. “I don’t think anybody will forget that a year from now. And what Democrats are doing is trying to will it into existence that this is not going to matter,” Andrabi explained. But, he added, “it matters so much to so many of their core voting bases”. Delaware State Representative Madinah Wilson-Anton, who was part of ahunger strikeoutside the White House this week calling for a ceasefire, expressed bewilderment at the mainstream Democrats’ position. “I’m trying to figure out what the rationale is,” she told Al Jazeera, voicing disappointment in Biden. “People feel betrayed. People feel like they were led to believe he was this moral leader that was going to restore the soul of America.” New York State Representative Zohran Mamdani said Americans are desperate for a government that represents them and their demands. He expressed surprise that calls for a ceasefire have been deemed controversial. “I don’t know how this demand is characterised as something that is far-left. This is the most mainstream demand in America today on foreign policy,” he said.",Published On 2 Dec 2023
"Is­rael-Gaza war up­dates: ‘No ne­go­ti­a­tions now on truce’, says Hamas",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/12/2/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-bombs-rain-down-on-gaza-after-truce-collapse,"This live page is now closed. For the latest live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, follow alonghere. We will soon be closing this live page. Here’s a recap of today’s key events: One person has been killed and two others injured after an assailant attacked passersby in Paris near the Eiffel Tower, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has said. “The police have just courageously arrested an assailant attacking passersby in Paris, around the Quai de Grenelle. One deceased person and one injured person treated by the Paris fire brigade. Please avoid the area,” Darmanin posted on the social media platform X on Saturday. Darmanin said the suspect told police he was upset over the situation in Gaza. BFM TV reported that the man who died was a German national and that the assailant had used a hammer to carry out the attacks. reporting from Khan Younis in Gaza The entire Gaza Strip had been earlier targeted by the Israeli occupation forces but during the last hour, the Israeli occupation forces had levelled to the ground a residential building in the Rafah district. More than six Palestinians have been reported killed and a number of them have been injured. Meanwhile, the eastern areas of Khan Younis have been under artillery shelling for more than two hours. We can clearly hear the sounds of the Israeli explosions in the eastern areas of Khan Younis again. Israel are trying to destroy all buildings that are adjacent to the borders and they are also firing illumination flares into the sky of eastern areas of Khan Younis which could clearly be seen from our location here in the centre of Khan Younis City. Similarly, the attacks continue in Nuseirat refugee camp where more than nine Palestinians have reportedly been killed with 10 others who have been also wounded in a residential building that was hit by the occupation forces. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has condemned Israel’s attack on Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp. “More than 100 men, women and children were killed in the bombing of residential buildings hosting displaced families,” the US-based Muslim advocacy group in a statement. “Each day brings another war crime in the far-right Israeli government’s genocidal campaign of ethnic cleansing in Gaza,” Nihad Awad, CAIR’s national executive director said. “These are American bombs being dropped on civilians – paid for with American taxpayer dollars.”  Dr Mads Gilbert, who has worked in Gaza, says the objective of the Israeli military is clear and it is the “elimination of the Palestinian people”. “They are killing and injuring by bombing. They are starving and thirsting and freezing people to death. The WHO said recently more people can now die from disease, famine, thirst and hypothermia than from bombing,” Gilbert told Al Jazeera. “I talked to my colleagues in al-Aqsa Hospital earlier. It normally has 198 beds. They have more than 650 patients. There is no room to treat them. These doctors and medical students are doing a heroic job trying to handle this massive flow of patients coming in.”  Israel’s military is ignoring international appeals to spare civilians. The military said it hit more than 400 “Hamas targets” across Gaza over the past day, using air strikes and shelling from tanks and navy gunships. It included more than 50 attacks on the city of Khan Younis and surrounding areas in the southern half of Gaza. At least nine people, including three children, were killed in an attack on a house in Deir al-Balah city in the south, according to the hospital where the bodies were taken. The hospital also received seven bodies of others killed in overnight attacks, including two children. The death toll in Gaza has exceeded 15,200 with more than 40,000 people wounded since October 7. The health ministry said 70 percent of the dead were women and children.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

But thousands more remain in detention and Israel continues to arrest people. So, why were they imprisoned in the first place?  Muslim-American leaders from six battleground states have pledged to mobilise their communities against President Joe Biden’s re-election over his support of Israel’s war on Gaza. The so-called #AbandonBiden campaign began when Minnesota Muslim-Americans demanded the president to call for a ceasefire and has spread to Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. The states are among a handful that allowed Biden to win the 2020 election. Opposition from their sizeable Muslim and Arab-American communities could complicate the president’s path to victory next year. “We don’t have two options. We have many options,” Jaylani Hussein, director of Minnesota’s Council on American-Islamic Relations chapter, said at a press conference. “We’re not supporting [former President Donald] Trump.”  This is a modal window.

Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem It is certainly the largest barrage of rockets we have seen from the Gaza Strip since the ceasefire ended. A huge barrage hitting multiple places within Israeli territory in the south, in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Most of those rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome defence system. We are hearing at least one person has been injured. This is a very significant statement from Hamas. It is a message that they can still do this. We are 57 days into the war and Hamas still has the capability to fire rockets into Israel.   ",Published On 2 Dec 2023
More than 180 killed as Is­rael re­sumes Gaza as­sault,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/more-than-170-killed-as-israel-resumes-bombing-of-gaza-after-truce-expires,"Israeli forces prohibit entry of aid trucks via Rafah crossing, the Palestinian Red Crescent says. More than 180 people have been killed and hundreds of others wounded as Israeli forces resumed their bombardment of the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian officials, after a week-long truce expired. Eastern areas of Khan Younis in southern Gaza came under intense bombardment as the deadline lapsed shortly after dawn on Friday, with columns of smoke rising into the sky, the Reuters news agency reported. Residents took to the road with belongings heaped in carts, searching for shelter further west. Sirens blared across southern Israel as militants fired rockets from the coastal enclave into towns. Hamas said it had targeted Tel Aviv, but there were no reports of casualties or damage there. Gaza health officials said Israeli air strikes had killed 184 people, wounded at least 589 others and hit more than 20 houses. The Israeli military dropped leaflets over Gaza City and southern parts of the enclave on Friday, urging civilians to flee to avoid the fighting, but rights groups have repeatedly warned there are no safe places in Gaza. “Civilians are being ordered to move south, but nowhere in Gaza is safe due to the indiscriminate bombing and continued fighting,” said the NGO Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) on X, calling on the Israeli army to rescind the order.  The UN said the fighting would worsen an extreme humanitarian emergency. “Hell on Earth has returned to Gaza,” Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office in Geneva, said. The Palestinian Red Crescent (PRCS) says Israeli forces informed “all organisations and entities” operating at the crossing that the entry of trucks is “prohibited, starting from today” and until further notice. “This decision exacerbates the suffering of citizens and increases the challenges facing humanitarian and relief organisations in alleviating the hardships of citizens and displaced persons due to the ongoing aggression,” the PRCS said in a post on X. Speaking to reporters after Israel resumed its bombardment, Gaza’s government media office called on Arab and Muslim states to urgently establish field hospitals in the besieged enclave to save “tens of thousands of injured people”. The office’s spokesperson, Salama Marouf, said a “large number of aid trucks” is also urgently needed, including at least one million litres (more than 264,000 gallons) of fuel per day. Marouf called on countries, especially members of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, to come up with an “urgent rescue plan” and to find “quick humanitarian solutions that address the fate of more than 250,000 families who have lost their homes”. Each of the warring sides blamed the other for causing the collapse of the truce by rejecting terms to extend the daily release of hostages held by armed groups in exchange for Palestinian detainees. The pause, which began on November 24, had been extended twice, and Israel had said it could continue as long as Hamas released 10 hostages each day. But after seven days during which women, children and foreign hostages were freed, mediators failed at the final hour to find a formula to release more, including Israeli soldiers and civilian men. Qatar, which has played a central role in mediation efforts along with the United States and Egypt, said negotiations were still going on with Israelis and Palestinians to restore the truce, but that Israel’s renewed bombardment of Gaza had complicated its efforts. In a meeting with the United Kingdom’s newly appointed Foreign Secretary David Cameron on the sidelines of COP28 in Dubai, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, said his country was committed to continuing efforts to de-escalate. According to a a statement released by Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the two reviewed the latest developments in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories as well as ways to implement a lasting ceasefire. The White House also said it was pushing to restore the truce, with press secretary John Kirby telling reporters on Friday evening that the US wants to see more captives released and more humanitarian aid get into the Strip. “There has been some disappointment, the fact that the US efforts to extend the ceasefire were not successful, but the other reaction has been to simply repeat the Israeli line that the end of the ceasefire came about because of actions by Hamas,” Al Jazeera’s Mike Hannah reported from Washington, DC. “Blinken says Israel is acting immediately to ensure the safety of civilians in the conflict zones, giving them areas in which they will take safe shelter. This ignores the fact that Israel has, in turn, ignored the humanitarian notification system,” he added. Egypt says it was also working to reinstate the truce in Gaza as soon as possible, according to a statement by Egypt’s State Information Service. More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, including more than 6,150 children. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200.  This is a modal window.

"Clash­es over fos­sil fu­els, Gaza war at COP28 cli­mate sum­mit",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/clashes-over-fossil-fuels-gaza-war-at-cop28-climate-summit,"Israel’s assault on Gaza resumes the day after the summit reaches an agreement over a long-sought rehabilitation fund. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged world leaders at the COP28 climate summit to plan for a future without fossil fuels, saying there was no other way to curb global warming. Speaking a day after COP28 President Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber proposed embracing the continued use of fossil fuels, Guterres said: “We cannot save a burning planet with a fire hose of fossil fuels.” “The 1.5-degree limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce. Not abate,” he said on Friday, referring to nascent technologies to capture and store carbon emissions. The competing visions summed up the difficulty of the UN climate talks in the oil-producing United Arab Emirates, where divisions over fossil fuels and acrimony over lagging financing and geopolitical tensions around the war in Gaza threatened to distract delegates from making progress. An agreement was reached on Thursday for the creation of a “loss and damage fund” to help poor countries weather the impacts of climate change, which is largely the result of fossil fuel use by rich countries, which have produced a large share of cumulative emissions. While such a fund has long been sought by developing nations, which stand to lose the most from climate change and have urged richer countries to provide assistance, only $700m was dedicated to the fund. Poor countries had said $100bn is needed. A member from a developing nation on the summit’s main advisory board also resigned on Friday after reports that the host, the United Arab Emirates, would use the event to try to secure commercial deals on further oil and gas production. “These actions undermine the integrity of the COP presidency and the process as a whole,” Hilda Heine, former president of the low-lying, climate-vulnerable Marshall Islands, said in a resignation letter. A spokesperson for al-Jaber, who is also the head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, has denied the reports and said he is “extremely disappointed” by the resignation. Some world leaders took their turn at the podium on Friday to criticise Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, breaking an unspoken agreement to steer clear of politics at UN climate summits. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erodgan and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa accused Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza during their speeches while an Israeli official said the military was abiding by international law and was intent on destroying Hamas. “South Africa is appalled by the cruel tragedy that is under way in Gaza. The war against the innocent people of Palestine is a war crime that must be ended now,” Ramaphosa said. “As we see in this region, conflicts are causing immense suffering and intense emotion,” Guterres said in remarks on Friday. “We just had the news that the bombs are sounding again in Gaza.” “We are here all together, all the world together, to combat climate change and, really, we’re negotiating for what?” asked Hadeel Ikhmais, a climate change expert with the Palestinian Authority. “We’re negotiating for what in the middle of a genocide?” Israeli President Isaac Herzog had been scheduled to give a speech on Friday but did not do so after other leaders criticised Israel’s heavy bombardment of Gaza, which Colombian President Gustavo Petro called “genocide and barbarism unleashed on the Palestinian people”.",Published On 1 Dec 2023
"At least three killed in south Lebanon as Is­rael, Hezbol­lah re­sume fight­ing",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/at-least-three-killed-in-south-lebanon-as-israel-hezbollah-resume-fighting,"Israeli shelling kills a woman and her son in Houla as Hezbollah says one of its fighters is also killed. Israeli shelling has killed three people in southern Lebanon, Lebanon’s state news agency reports after the end of a truce between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas prompted a resumption of hostilities at the Israel-Lebanon border. The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, said one of its fighters was among those killed on Friday. It said it had carried out several attacks on Israeli military positions at the border in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where a weeklong pause in the fighting ended early in the day. The Israeli army said its artillery struck sources of fire from Lebanon and its air defences had intercepted two launches. The army also said it struck a “terrorist cell”. Sirens warning of incoming rockets sounded in several towns in northern Israel, sending residents running for shelter. Lebanon’s National News Agency reported that two people were killed by Israeli shelling in the Lebanese border town of Houla and one person was killed in the village of Jebbayn.

Since the eruption of theHamas-Israel war on October 7, Hezbollah has mounted near daily rocket attacks on Israeli positions at the border while Israel has conducted air and artillery strikes in southern Lebanon. It has been the worst fighting since a 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, which is part of an Iran-backed alliance that also includes Hamas. About 100 people in Lebanon have been killed during the hostilities, 80 of them Hezbollah fighters. Tens of thousands of people have fled from both sides of the border. On November 5, an Israeli air attack killed four civilians –three children and their grandmother. Three Lebanese journalists have also been killed in Israeli attacks.

Pho­tos: Thou­sands march for Pales­tine as Is­rael and Hamas re­sume fight­ing,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/1/thousands-march-for-palestine-as-israel-and-hamas-resume-fighting,"In Pictures Thousands of people in Jordan have participated in a march for the eighth week in a row in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in a protest that coincides with the end of a humanitarian pause and resumption of Israeli attacks. The march began after the Friday prayer in front of the Grand Husseini Mosque in the centre of the capital, Amman, and proceeded to Palm Square, an Anadolu Agency correspondent reported. Jordan’s government condemned Friday’s resumption of Israel’s “futile, aggressive” war on Gaza, calling for a “deterrent” international stance against Israel. Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank gathered in the city of Hebron to protest against the Israeli assault on Gaza. In Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, tens of thousands of people took part in a march to show solidarity with Palestinians.

Gaza aid trucks strand­ed as Is­rael-Hamas war re­sumes,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/gaza-aid-trucks-stranded-as-israel-hamas-war-resumes,"Egyptian security sources say aid and fuel trucks from Egypt have stopped, as UN officials say continuation of aid delivery in doubt. Aid was stranded near Egypt’s border with Gaza as Israel resumed its military campaign on Friday, with truck drivers saying they expected further delays to a complex delivery process that had briefly speeded up during a weeklong truce. “The bombardment has been going on since seven in the morning. There are planes and artillery and we haven’t moved,” said driver Saleh Ebada, who had already been waiting to enter the crossing for inspection for eight days when fighting restarted. Egyptian security sources and a Red Crescent official said aid and fuel trucks had stopped entering from Egypt. UN officials described the resumption of fighting as “catastrophic” and said the continuation of aid delivery was in doubt. A spokesperson for the Rafah border crossing confirmed that the entrance of trucks carrying much-needed aid, fuel and cooking gas from Egypt into the Gaza Strip had stopped because of the resumption of the Israeli bombardment. Rafah has been the only entry point for aid going into Gaza since Israel began besieging and bombarding the coastal territory in retaliation for a lethal October 7 incursion and the capture of hostages by the Palestinian armed group Hamas. Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health in Gaza, appealed to “every living conscience” to allow the opening of the Rafah crossing amid an “extremely catastrophic” humanitarian crisis. “The medical aid that entered Gaza during the truce is only enough for one day,” al-Qudra said in a statement. “The health sector in Gaza is out of service in every sense of the word,” he said. Only three hospitals are functioning in Gaza and they are not equipped to receive a large number of patients, he added. His comment came as Israeliair attackskilled at least 109 people and wounded hundreds, according to Palestinian officials. Medics are struggling to help patients who are piling up on hospital floors amid a shortage of beds. More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, Palestinian officials say. In Israel, the official death toll from the October 7 attack stands at about 1,200. International flights have been landing at El Arish airport in Sinai to deliver cargoes of aid. Convoys of trucks have also been bringing aid from Cairo. Under a system in place since October 21, aid trucks had to drive for inspection to the Al-Awja and Nitzana crossing on Egypt’s border with Israel before returning to Rafah to deliver their cargoes, a round trip of more than 80km (50 miles) that aid workers and Egyptian officials say caused bottlenecks. A truce over the past week allowed more food, medicines, fuel and water to be delivered, but the quantities remained far less than required for Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, most of them internally displaced by the war. Egyptian truck drivers said they had been subject to lengthy delays while waiting for inspections and scanning of goods supervised by Israeli security personnel at Al-Awja. “All the obstacles are there because they are the ones controlling the movement of goods,” said Gameel Mahmoud Idrees, a driver waiting near the Rafah crossing with a cargo of food supplies, his second delivery of aid since the war began. “We enter the crossing and wait for four or five days until the inspection is completed,” he said. The United Nations has lobbied for Israel to open the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing near Rafah which handled large quantities of goods before the war. But Israel, which fears aid could be used by Hamas, has so far refused. The truce allowed for about 200 aid trucks to enter Gaza daily, more than double the previous average. That compares with as many as 500 trucks daily before the war, when there were fewer needs for urgent supplies. Before the truce, Egyptian truck drivers had been unloading at Rafah, with goods loaded onto another truck for distribution into Gaza, and deliveries sometimes interrupted by shortages of fuel or bombardments. During the truce, some trucks had been driving from the Egyptian side straight through into Gaza, Ebada said. Idrees, the second truck driver, said as the fighting began again that he could easily be stuck for a week. “We’re waiting until we get security clearance because there are around 350 trucks inside [at Al-Awja], and they have to be done with them first,” he said.

Lula faces nu­mer­ous chal­lenges as Brazil as­sumes G20 pres­i­den­cy,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/12/1/lula-faces-numerous-challenges-as-brazil-assumes-g20-presidency,"Lula also takes over at a time of bitter internal divisions in the group, legacy of outgoing president Narendra Modi. As Brazil takes over the G20 presidency on December 1 from India, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will be challenged to fulfil his promise of holding up the interests of the global south amid two ongoing wars and a slowing global economy. Lula also takes over at a time ofbitter internal divisionswithin the group, the legacy of outgoing president Narendra Modi, whose team, eager to force a joint declaration, ran roughshod over diplomatic niceties in closed-door meetings. Despite these hurdles, Lula is forging ahead and has announced Brazil’s three key priorities as head of the G20: social inclusion and the fight against hunger, phasing out fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy and reforming global economic governance. The Group of Twenty – the G20 – is a forum for the world’s largest economies to coordinate on key issues of global policy. Between them, G20 countries represent 85 percent of global output and two-thirds of the world’s population. The G20 is made up of the European Union and 19 other countries, a mix of advanced and emerging economies. At its G20 leadership summit in September, India invited the African Union – representing 55 countries from across the continent – to become a member of the group. This was seen as a step to underscore Modi’s self-prescribed role as “the mother of democracy … to mitigate the global trust deficit” between rich and poor nations. The G20 was founded in 1999, following the Asian financial crisis. Originally designed as a council for finance ministers to discuss macroeconomic policy, its scope has since widened to cover issues ranging from global development to climate change and gender equality. Critics, in turn, have dismissed the G20 as an ineffectual talking shop. In over 200 meetings, the group did coalesce around its yearlydeclaration. Otherwise, New Delhi only delivered one joint statement – on the African Union. Against a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, South Africa and Brazil haveopenly criticisedIsrael’s bombardment of Gaza. For its part, Chinahosted a delegationof Muslim countries in November calling for a ceasefire. Elsewhere, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also undermined efforts at consensus-building. Despite maintaining a neutral stance on that conflict, India has becomemore criticalof Russia in recent months. Modi has also pared back military purchases from Moscow and bolstered diplomatic ties with the West. Vladimir Putin, who is under an internationalarrest warrantfor war crimes, declined to attend September’s gathering in New Delhi. President Xi Jinping of China also skipped the event, amid growing geopolitical tensions with India and deepening ties with Russia. That didn’t stop India from “turning the annual summit into a commercial for the personality cult of Modi,” said Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “In practice, it was an ineffectual presidency,” with the host keener on boosting its domestic image than addressing global challenges. “While trying to project India as a global superpower, Modi passes on the baton with no shortage of problems … the world economy is slowing, climate change is looming and conflicts in the Ukraine and Palestine have undermined north-south relations,” she added. Ahead of this week’s handover, Lula informed a virtual summit of G20 leaders that “I hope this [Israeli-Palestinianceasefire] agreement can pave the way for a lasting political solution to the conflict.” Brazil has long maintained support for a two-state solution. SinceHamas’s attacks on October 7 and the ensuing Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Lula has repeatedly called for a swift and definitive end to the fighting. In October, Brazil spearheaded a UN Security Councilresolutionwhich called for a pause in the conflict but was vetoed by the US. “Lula’s position on Israel is delicate, but he’s arguably the best-placed global statesman to try and stop the carnage,” added Ghosh. Elsewhere, Brazil’s president has irked Western leaders by suggesting that Russia and Ukraine sharejoint responsibilityfor their conflict. He has publicly backed both Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin to attend the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro next year. At the G20 summit in New Delhi in September, President Lula urged leaders to try and end world hunger by 2030. “Part of that could be achieved through the creation of a global task force against hunger,” a Brazilian government official, who asked not to be named, told Al Jazeera. “The task force would seek to rally support in areas like low-carbon agricultural research and farming insurance improvements, especially in food-insecure countries … that would require more funding from wealthy nations,” the source said. It’s not clear how likely it is that those would come through. Lula has also backed the idea of a minimum global corporate tax rate of 15 percent. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) plan, designed in 2021 to clamp down on tax evasion and stem decades of tax ‘competition’ between governments, could generate at least $150bn inadditional global tax revenuesannually. Almost 140 governments have signed up to the OECD agreement, and are at varying stages of turning the proposal into law. “By expanding the OECD’s scheme, Brazil also wants to ramp up investment in the green transition. Lula wants the G20 to deploy more funds in renewable energy and nature conservation projects,” the official noted. For years, Lula has lobbied to reinforce the role of multilateral bodies such as the United Nations to try and resolve global challenges. His commitment to diplomacy, however, goes beyond a penchant for consensus. At the UN General Assembly in New York in September, Lula defended the need to reshape the global governance system. “The unequal and distorted representation at the helm of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and World Bank is unacceptable,” he said. In 2022, the IMF provided $160bn inSDRs, the Fund’s reserve currency, to European countries and just $34bn to all of Africa. “The unfair allocation of SDRs is only part of the problem,” says Rogerio Studart, a former Brazilian representative to the World Bank. “Fund quota limits are also too small for emergency lending,” said Studart. He was alluding to IMF programmes such as the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, where country grants are capped at 150 percent of their capital commitments into the fund. “These curb the amount of money available for climate disasters, especially in low-income countries. I think that Lula will try and raise country quotas for emergency lending, and attempt to reduce the conditions attached to these programmes,” he added, pointing out that its success was unclear as this had been tried for years,” Studart also dismissed the World Bank’s “cautious” approach to risk tolerance. “The Bank can raise considerably more money for developing countries by adjusting its loan-to-equity ratio,” he said. A higher ratio would add to the Bank’s lending capacity, but come with a higher risk of non-repayment. His remarks echo a G20 report published in July which said that by raising their lending ratio slightly, groups like the World Bank could unlock billions of extra dollars in new lending. “Brazil will echo the findings from the report,” Studart said. For Ghosh, the economics professor, “Lula is nothing if not pragmatic. Where the previous G20 presidency was more about domestic politics, Lula is the ideal candidate to try and restore a measure of stability to today’s fractious world order.”",Published On 1 Dec 2023
An ‘un­for­tu­nate’ arrange­ment: Malaw­ians alarmed as work­ers head to Is­rael,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/1/apprehension-as-malawi-sends-workers-to-israel,"Opposition leader Kondwani Nankhumwa questions the secrecy of the deal and describes it as ‘an evil transaction’. Blantyre, Malawi– The departure of hundreds of Malawians to Israel to work as farm labourers has sparked a debate within the Southern African country, which is looking to raise much-needed foreign currency amid a cash crunch. On November 25, the first tranche of 221 workers left for Israel. Subsequent flights are expected in the days to come, according to a statement from the Ministry of Labour, which did not mention numbers. Details about the programme were first made public on November 23 by Kondwani Nankhumwa, leader of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party as he spoke in parliament, questioning the secrecy of the deal and describing it as “an evil transaction”. “[The] government has gone into such an agreement with Israeli companies when it is fully aware that there is war. No sane parent can send his or her child to work in a country that is at war,” Nankhumwa told journalists after. The move comes after months of Malawi facing a forex shortage that has disrupted businesses and led to the scarcity of essential commodities like fuel. The country is also experiencing a cost-of-living crisis further exacerbated by the central bank devaluating the national currency, the kwacha, by 44 percent “to counter supply-demand imbalances”. In November, President Lazarus Chakwerasuspendedforeign travel for government officials – the latest drastic measure to conserve funds in the country. The recent move is, therefore another attempt by the government to create jobs for its youthful population – half of Malawi’s 19 million people are 18 or below – and generate foreign exchange. According to the authorities, only 9 percent of its 20 million people are formally employed. In November, the IMF pumped in $174m into the country as an extended credit facility. That same month, the government of Israel gave out a $60m aid package to Malawi to prop up its economy. That aid and the dispatch of workers mark a new chapter in diplomatic ties between Malawi and Israel, which date back to the 1960s. For decades, Israel sent doctors and agricultural experts to Malawi. Malawis have also gone to Israel to study agriculture, which remains a major source of revenue for the country. During the Yom Kippur War of 1973, the Organisation of African Unity, the forerunner of the African Union, severed ties with Israel. Only four African countries remained steadfast. Malawi was one of them. In 2021, a year after taking office, Chakwera hinted that Malawi would strengthen relations by opening an embassy in Jerusalem. It has not done so yet. This year, Israel gave aid through its development agency IsraAID to Malawi and neighbouring Mozambique in the wake of Cyclone Freddy, which pummelled both countries. Government officials said the move to send workers to Israel is mutually beneficial for both countries, even if many details remain unclear. The Israeli Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has said 30,000 to 40,000 workers have left the country’s farms since the October 7 attacks by Hamas on southern Israel. Half of them are Palestinians, whom Israel has barred from entering from the occupied West Bank. Consequently, it has been on the hunt for up to 5,000 workers from elsewhere, including from its loyal ally Malawi. Authorities from the two countries have made assurances that the recruits will not be involved in warfare. But commentators are nevertheless questioning the timing and wondering if Malawi can repatriate its citizens if anything goes wrong as the war continues. “Everybody, including Thailand, is pulling out their people from Israel,” Victor Chipofya, a political science lecturer at Blantyre International University, told Al Jazeera by telephone. “How come Malawi is the only country taking our people to Israel? Those are the questions that we’re supposed to be asking ourselves.” Thai workers account for one of the largest migrant groups in Israel. As many as 30,000 of them were employed on farms in the country at the time of the Hamas attack. At least 32 Thais were taken captive on October 7, and many remain trapped within the Gaza Strip and Israel. An unknown number of Malawians may also be trapped in Gaza. After the war began, Chakwera called for a “cessation of violence by all parties” and the end to military action against known civilian targets in Gaza. He also called for the safety of 300 Malawians in Gaza who are believed to either be residents there or on pilgrimage in Israel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is yet to confirm if they have since returned home. When asked about them and the workers who left Malawi last week, a ministry spokesperson directed Al Jazeera to the Labour Ministry, which did not respond. The Centre for Social Accountability and Transparency, a nonprofit based in Lilongwe, has said it is engaging the National Assembly to address the concerns of Malawians that workers sent to Israel might be at risk of bodily harm or worse. William Kambwandira, its executive director, described the arrangement as “unfortunate” and akin to modern-day slavery. “Malawians are interested to know whether this is a government-to-government deal and what are the terms of reference for this deal, including what safety measures have been put in place to protect the young Malawians,” he told Al Jazeera.

Officials of the Malawian and Israeli governments have tried to assuage fears about Malawian citizens getting caught up in the war. In a statement on November 24, Secretary for Labour Wezi Kayira said the export of working personnel will also involve other countries and not only Israel, but there was no mention of any other countries. “The safety and security of the youth is paramount,” the statement read. “On the Israel labour export, the youth will work at certified and approved locations which are classified as fit and safe environments.” The young people will work on farms only and “will not be involved in any other activity”, she said, adding that medical insurance and repatriation arrangements are in place for those involved. “This program will benefit both individuals and the nation,” the statement added. “A portion of wages will cover living costs in Israel while the remainder will be remitted to personal accounts in Malawi to boost foreign exchange.” In a recent interview, Michael Lotem, the Israeli ambassador to Kenya, Uganda and Malawi, dismissed the concerns, saying the young people are not going to the Gaza Strip but will work in Israel. “We will take care of them as much as we are taking care of Israelis,” Totem was quoted as saying in the Malawian daily The Nation. “Of course, we are cautious that we do not have to allow people into certain areas that are targeted by Hamas, especially the borders.” Reports of the Malawian contingent signing an agreement to indemnify Israel have also surfaced on social media. Al Jazeera could not independently verify this agreement. “I understand that in this war, thousands of missiles have been and continue to be shot by Israel’s enemy at mostly civilian targets over Israel. I understand that many but not all the missiles are being shot down by anti-missiles systems but that some of the missiles hit their targets and that the hits as well as shrapnel can kill and injure persons [and] there is danger of terror attacks due to the war,” it reads. In parliaments and across Malawi, the debate continues. Chipofya has accused the president, a Christian, of having a “soft spot” for Israel like Malawi’s first president, Kamuzu Banda, who also belonged to the ruling Malawi Congress Party. “I feel that the current administration through Chakwera might be making certain decisions based on religious convictions and not necessarily understanding the political implication that these things may have in the long run,” he said.

The Is­rael-Hamas truce has end­ed: What we know so far,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/the-israel-hamas-truce-has-ended-what-we-know-so-far,"Israel resumed its deadly aerial bombardment on Gaza, minutes after the truce expired. Israel hasresumed air raidsin Gaza after a seven-day pause in fighting. Here is what we know so far: The Israel-Hamas truce began on November 24 and wasrenewed twicebefore ending on Friday. Under the truce, fighting was paused andhumanitarian aidwas allowed to enter Gaza as Hamas released captives in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners. The UN humanitarian office, OCHA,reportedthat despite the pause in fighting, Israeli forces shot at Palestinians in Gaza on November 29, killing two people. They also shelled people on November 30. Earlier on Friday, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Khan Younis in Southern Gaza that Palestinians were anxiously hoping that the truce would be extended to allow for more humanitarian aid into the enclave. An hour before the truce was supposed to end, at 7am (05:00 GMT), the Israeli military announced that itsIron Domemissile defence system had detected incoming rockets. After that, they “intercepted a launch from Gaza”.  “We have seen rockets being fired from Gaza before that have been intercepted by the Iron Dome that Hamas later said were simply a misfire,” reported Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan from East Jerusalem. “Or it could be a message to try and put some pressure on the Israelis to try and extend this ceasefire”. Hamas did not immediately respond or claim responsibility for the launches. The deadline for the extended truce passed with no announcement of an extension from either side. Minutes after, Israeli air raids and artillery fighting resumed in Gaza and witnesses in the enclave reported heavy clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighting groups. The Israeli militaryannounced on X, that the fighting is now resuming because “Hamas violated the operational pause” and “fired towards Israeli territory”.  On-ground clashes between Israel and Hamas have resumed in separate areas across the territory, reported Azzoum. At least 70 people have been killed since Israel’s army resumed its attacks, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Two people have been killed in Beit Lahia in the north of the Gaza Strip. There is heavy shelling in eastern Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Israeldropped leafletsasking people in Khan Younis to move further south towards Rafah on the border with Egypt. One casualty has been reported in Khan Younis city while two have been killed in Hamad town, south of Khan Younis.  On Friday, a building in northern Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp was completely destroyed. There are reports that a house has also been destroyed in Rafah in the south of Gaza. Israel is also shelling near Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza. Also in central Gaza, 10 people have been killed and a number of civilians have been wounded in the Maghazi area. Due to Israeli bombardment and clashes that began after theOctober 7 Hamas attack, about 60 percent of homes in Gaza have been destroyed, reported Gaza’s government media office. At least 50,000 families and their extended families are now homeless and about 250,000 housing units have been partially destroyed. More than 15,000 people in Gaza, including at least 6,150 children, have died, according to Palestinian health authorities. During his third visit to Israel since the escalation of violence, US Secretary of StateAntony Blinken told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuon Thursday that Israel cannot repeat in southern Gaza the massive civilian casualties and displacement of residents it has inflicted in the north. Yet, there is no evidence that Israel is limiting the war. Spokesperson for Iran’s foreign ninistry, Nasser Kanaani, posted on X that “the political and legal responsibility for the continuation of the aggression and massacre” rests with Israel, the United States and “a few governments that support this apartheid regime”. Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera that the US has enough leverage to stop the fighting and influence other countries to change the course of the war. Vice chairman of the executive council of Lebanese armed groupHezbollah, Ali Damoush, says that Israel resumed its aggression on Gaza by a US decision. He called the US a decision-maker in this war, adding, “This war from the beginning has been America’s war against the Palestinian people,” on Telegram. Hamas’s armed wing, theQassam Brigades, announced on Telegram that it attacked the cities of Ashkelon, Sderot and Beersheba in southern Israel with rocket barrages. The group said the attacks were “in response to the targeting of civilians”. Nearly 240captiveswere taken by Hamas following the attack on October 7. Of them, 127 captives remain in Gaza, with 110 freed as part of the truce. Israel initially released a list of 300Palestinian prisonerseligible for release during the pause in fighting. A list of 50 more names of prisoners eligible was released later. Of the 350 prisoners, 240 have been released and 110 remain. However, at the same time, Israel has arrested about the same number of  Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that with the resumption of fighting, Israel was committed to achieving its targets in the war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar released a statement on Friday, expressing “deep regret at the resumption of the Israeli aggression against Gaza”. The statement added that negotiations between Hamas and Israel are continuing “with the aim of returning to a state of the pause”. Qatar has been central to mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas.  Israel’s participation in the 28th UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) which started on Thursday in Dubai amid the continuing war, was alsocriticisedby some. Meanwhile, with the war starting again, no aid entered Gaza on Friday from the Rafah crossing with Egypt.",Published On 1 Dec 2023
Me­di­a­tors push to re­new truce as Is­rael-Hamas war re­sumes,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/mediators-continuing-efforts-to-renew-israel-gaza-truce-amid-fighting,"‘Those in power have decided that the killing of children would recommence,’ UN official says as humanitarian pause ends. Efforts to renew the Israel-Hamas truce are under way, mediator Qatar says, after Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza, killing dozens of Palestinians. Qatar, which led the talks that produced the weeklong humanitarian pause thatended on Friday morning, said it will persist in seeking a renewed agreement but warned that the resumption of hostilities is complicating matters. Officials around the world shared their disappointment at the unravelling of the truce and swift return to fighting. Some called for urgent efforts to stem the violence and prevent further civilian casualties inside the enclave.

Israel and Hamas have blamed one another for the breakdown of the truce. “The Hamas-ISIS terrorist organization has violated the outline. It has not met its obligation to release all of the women hostages today and has launched rockets at Israeli citizens,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Friday. “The government of Israel is committed to achieving the goals of the war: Releasing the hostages, eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to the residents of Israel,” it added. Hamas officials accused Israel of working to wreck efforts to extend the truce. Osama Hamdan, a senior official for the group, which governs Gaza, told Al Jazeera: “Every day in the past seven days of the temporary ceasefire, Israel was acting in a way to undermine the whole process. We were and we still are positive about all the efforts, but the Israelis are refusing them.” Qatar, which together with Egypt and the United States has been mediating between Israel and Hamas, confirmed on Friday that “negotiations between the two sides are continuing with the aim of returning to a state of pause.” It said it is committed “to continuing the efforts that led to the humanitarian pause, and will not hesitate to do everything necessary to return to calm”. But it added that the renewed fighting “complicates mediation efforts and exacerbates the humanitarian catastrophe”. Qatar also urged “the international community to move quickly to stop the violence”.  Last week, mediators worked through the night to clinch the final details of the truce that began on November 24 and lasted for seven days before the hostilities resumed on Friday at 7am (05:00 GMT). Before the truce began, weeks of Israeli bombardment killed more than 15,000 Palestinians in Gaza, about 6,000 of them children. The campaign came after Hamas’s attacks on southern Israel on October 7, which killed 1,200 people and resulted in about 240 prisoners being taken back to Gaza. During the pause, Hamas freed 110 of those captives, including 80 Israelis, in exchange for 240 Palestinianprisoners. In addition, the truce allowed more desperately needed aid to enter Gaza although supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel remain far below the levels needed by the 2.3 million people living there. In the first few hours after the truce expired on Friday morning, Israeli bombardments killed dozens across all areas of the Gaza Strip, including the south, which Israel had said was a safe area. Meanwhile, the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s armed wing, said it fired rocket barrages at the cities of Ashkelon, Sderot and Beersheba in southern Israel. “Inaction, at its core, is an approval of the killing of children,” James Elder, a spokesperson for UNICEF, said via video link from Gaza, adding: “It is reckless to think more attacks on the people of Gaza will lead to anything other than carnage.” “Has humanity given up on the children of Gaza?!” he asked in a post on X.  The director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Robert Mardini, warned that the renewed fighting takes people in Gaza back to a “nightmarish situation” and warned that it will slow or halt aid efforts. Several officials around the world called for the two sides to go back to the negotiating table. “The return to hostilities only shows how important it is to have a true humanitarian ceasefire,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres posted on X.  UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said: “The resumption of hostilities in Gaza is catastrophic,” and he urged all parties with influence “to redouble efforts, immediately, to ensure a ceasefire – on humanitarian and human rights grounds.” “Rupture of the truce is very bad news, regrettable, because it brings no solution and complicates the resolution of all questions that arise,” French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said. She called a truce resumption “essential”. “We are disappointed that after a brief pause, Israel has restarted bombing the Palestinian people,” a spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Germany’s Federal Foreign Office called for the international community to do everything in its power to ensure the continuation of the truce. Working to ensure that Hamas does not pose a threat to Israel’s existence and that it is disarmed is necessary to end the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis, the ministry said on X. “Of course, that would also mean that Hamas would have to lay down its weapons. Only in this way a political horizon can open up for a two-state solution that can provide security for both Israelis and Palestinians,” it said. Russia said it had hoped for an extension of the pause in the fighting. “We would certainly have preferred to see news of another extension of the humanitarian pause,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, adding that Moscow would “continue efforts” to secure the release of Russian citizens captured by Hamas. Iran, meanwhile, hit out at Israel and the United States. “After killing more than 15,000 Palestinians, the Zionist vampires have started a new round of killing under the continued support of the American government,” Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a post on X. He added that “the political and legal responsibility for the continuation of the aggression and massacre” rests with Israel, the US and “a few governments that support this apartheid regime”.

‘My son was killed on Oc­to­ber 6. There was no Hamas’,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/1/my-son-was-killed-on-october-6-there-was-no-hamas,"Family of teen killed in West Bank before Hamas attack says Israel’s actions against Palestinians not about Hamas. Nablus, occupied West Bank –It has been almost two months since Najlaa Dmaidi’s eldest son, 19-year-old Labib, wasshot deadby Israeli settlers. But for the 42-year-old mother, time has stopped. She keeps her head down and her eyes glued to the ground in sorrow over her killed son. “He turned 19 on July 21. His birthday was on the same day his sister’s high school matriculation exam results came out,” she said in a muffled voice. Sitting in the living room of her home in the Palestinian town of Huwara, south of Nablus city, Najlaa said: “That was the last time we all celebrated together.” Huwara is surrounded by four illegal Israeli settlements and countless settler outposts, military checkpoints and bases. It has come undersevere settler attacksand movement restrictions imposed by the Israeli army for more than a year and a half. “Labib would always liven up the house. He loved to joke, to play, he loved life, he also loved his homeland,” Najlaa said, fidgeting with her fingers. On the night of October 5 – and into the early hours of October 6 – dozens of Israeli settlers attacked the Dmaidi home which is situated on the Huwara road – the main artery running from the north to the south used by both Palestinians and settlers. The attack came hours after a Palestinian carried out a drive-by shooting in the town, causing no injuries. “The settlers were gathered in front of our building and snipers standing on rooftops were shooting at people,” Najlaa explained, adding that the “army was with” the settlers and that they were firing tear gas into their home. Some 25 family members, including 13 children, were inside when the attack took place. Labib was shot dead while standing on the roof of his uncle’s house just opposite his family’s building. “His 12-year-old brother was standing next to him when he was shot,” said Najlaa. Labib was in his second year of a graphic design degree at Palestine Technical University – Kadoorie in the nearby city of Tulkarm. His father, 50-year-old Mohammad, an engineer, is a soft-spoken man with a neatly shaved beard. “I would sit with Labib and we would draw plans for his future,” he recalled. “In a blink of an eye, all of these dreams were shattered.” The father-of-three said he was very proud of his son before he was killed. “Labib would go to university every day, and after that he would work at his uncle’s store in Huwara,” Mohammad told Al Jazeera, adding that his son was also taking a course in home decor. The worsening conditions for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, particularly in Huwara, make it difficult to imagine a better future for Palestinian children, he said. “No one is not afraid for their children, their nephews and nieces,” said Mohammad. “They have no future.” Owing to its location on a main highway in the occupied West Bank, Huwara’s 9,000 residents once enjoyed a steady stream of business due to the constant flow of Palestinians driving through from other cities and villages. But since May 2022, the Israeli army and settlers have slowly turned Huwara into a ghost town, much likeShuhada Streetin the Old City of Hebron. On February 27, hundreds of settlers rampaged through Huwara, carrying out what wasdescribed as a “pogrom”and which left a 37-year-old Palestinian man dead, hundreds of others injured, and dozens of cars and homes burned down. Several other attacks have happened since. Israelreimposed movement closureson October 5 after the drive-by shooting in the town, with the vast majority of Huwara’s 800 stores forced to shut their doors. They have never reopened. “We were not even allowed to walk or stand on the road at all for the first 45 days after October 5,” said Najlaa.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  Mohammad believes that Israel used the Gaza-based Hamas armed group attack on Israel two days later, on October 7, to severely intensify restrictions in Huwara. That day, Hamas fighters killed some 1,200 people in a surprise operation. Shortly afterwards, Israel launched an ongoing shelling campaign on the besieged Gaza Strip, killing at least 15,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,000 children. But Labib’s father said the focus on Hamas since October 7 shifts the focus from Israel’s policies against the Palestinian people as a whole. “They claim that what is happening is about Hamas. My son was killed on October 6. There was no Hamas,” Mohammad told Al Jazeera. “When they burned down Huwara in February, there was no Hamas. When they attacked our house yet again two weeks after they killed my son, there was no Hamas,” he said. “Imagine that a minister of a state comes out and says to the media ‘erase Huwara’ – what world are we living in?” Due to the frequency of settler attacks and heavy militarisation of Huwara and the southern area of Nablus, which is also heavily populated with illegal settlements, the Dmaidi family said their children are suffering severely psychologically. “My niece has a literal nervous breakdown when she sees the settlers. Particularly after the night Labib was killed, she falls to the ground and starts shaking,” said Mohammad. “All the children of the family saw Labib lying on the ground on the street bleeding out after we carried him from the roof. It was horrific for them,” he explained. The killed teen’s father said he believes the Palestinian Authority (PA) shares part of the blame for the situation of residents in the occupied West Bank today. The PA was created as a temporary governing body in 1993 and has administrative control over small pockets of the occupied West Bank. It was meant to serve for five years in the lead-up to the creation of an independent Palestinian state in the 1967-occupied territories of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The continuing Israeli occupation, land theft and settlement building have meant that the Palestinian state was never created. Many Palestinians now view the PA as little more than a subcontractor for the Israeli occupation due to the requirement that it share intelligence with the Israeli authorities, among other policies. “We have been living under the illusion of a state for 30 years,” said Mohammad. “I used to go up to the mountain, there was no Yitzhar [an Israeli settlement south of Nablus]. Thanks to Oslo, Yitzhar is now here. The settler comes down with all ease to the centre of our town – this is all based on Oslo. Now in two or three years, they won’t just come to the front door, we are going to find them in our living rooms,” he said. “We have a president, we have a prime minister, and yet, we have nothing at the same time.”",Published On 1 Dec 2023
"Pales­tin­ian refugees in Lebanon mourn, fear for fam­i­ly in war-torn Gaza",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/palestinian-refugees-in-lebanon-mourn-fear-for-family-in-war-torn-gaza,"‘I’m not sleeping. I cry all night,’ says Fatmeh, whose daughter and grandkids are trapped under Israeli bombardment. Tripoli, Lebanon– When the humanitarian pause started in Gaza, Fatmeh Abu Swareh hadn’t heard from her daughter Wafaa in nearly two weeks. “I’m not sleeping. I sit here at 3am and cry. I cry all night… all day,” she said a few days before the pause in her living room in Beddawi, a Palestinian refugee camp northeast of Tripoli, Lebanon’s second-largest city. She feared the worst for her daughter and four grandchildren. Once the pause was implemented, Wafaa finally got through to her mother, but things are still tough. “My daughter doesn’t have food or anything to drink,” she said. “Even with the truce, they’re scared of the [Israeli] planes.” More than 15,000 people have been killed by Israel in Gaza since October 7, including at least 6,000 children. The Israeli assault was ostensibly in retribution for a Hamas-led attack into Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and captured more than 200. The actual Palestinian death toll is higher than 15,000 as thousands of people are still missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Some 210,000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon, most still in the refugee camps set up for their forebears who arrived during the Nakba in 1948, fleeing violent Zionist gangs. Beddawi has about 20,000 people living in it, all of them transfixed by the news coming out of Gaza since October 7. The news has deeply impacted everyone, with physical and emotional signs of stress proliferating. It has also boosted national pride, with a huge uptick in sales of Palestinian flags and keffiyehs. Everyone is suffering, but especially those with family in Gaza. Ducking into a clothing shop to get away from the noisy street outside, Ossama Najjar, 47, stood with his back to the enticingly stacked jeans. He’s not interested. He has lost count of the family members lost in Gaza, he said. “Every day, I look online for the Ministry of Health lists with names of people from the Najjar family who were martyred,” he said. Mustafa Abu Harb worries often about his own uncle and cousin in Gaza. The clean-shaven Fatah official for north Lebanon sits in his office with framed photos of Yasser Arafat and his successor as Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, over his shoulders. “I’m talking to you here but my heart is there with my uncle and cousin,” he said from behind his desk, slumping slightly in his crisp blue shirt and grey blazer. “They’re killing the future generations of Palestine,” he said, fighting back tears. Fatah member Ahmad Hasan Alaaraj, also in the office, lost six family members in Gaza since October 7. He was overcome by emotion several times while Abu Harb spoke and was only able to add: “Most people here have someone [in Gaza].” On a normal day, Najjar works in aluminium. But since October 7, “No one is working,” he said animatedly, his brow covered in sweat despite the sun beginning to set on this cool autumn afternoon. “All our attention is on Gaza. Everything on Facebook is Gaza.” While many others in Beddawi have lost relatives, even those without family in Gaza are suffering. Dr Ali Wehbe, Palestinian Red Crescent director in north Lebanon, said the constant news barrage of death and destruction in Gaza was impacting his patients. From his office in the Safad Hospital, he said many patients now had high blood pressure while others reported increased psychological distress. Wehbe doesn’t have family in Gaza but has colleagues he studied with overseas and are now on the ground there, and he worries about them. “We were in touch but then the electricity went out,” he said. The feelings of helplessness have also manifested in an uptick in national solidarity. At a small bridal shop in the camp, Nadia Mahmoud Moussa stood next to a tapestry shaped like Palestine, each region embroidered in a pattern representing local traditions. Moussa pointed to a turquoise section, decorated with flowers and small pink, grey, blue and orange lozenges. “Here’s Gaza,” she said. Before October 7, Moussa sold bridal dresses and hired out musical troupes to perform Palestinian traditions like the dabkeh, a Levantine folk dance, or zaffeh, an animated singing, drumming and dancing procession performed at weddings. Black dresses embroidered in traditional Palestinian tatreez still hang from racks in her shop but now her big sellers are keffiyehs and Palestinian flags as people sought to express their solidarity by displaying national symbols. “We’re all living this pain,” she said. “We pray for patience and resilience. From kids to the elderly, we are now learning what it means to be martyrs.” Back in Abu Swareh’s living room, she wipes away tears between pained sentences. Her daughter has already had at least one brush with death, she said, when the house next to hers was hit by an Israeli attack. “It destroyed the whole house,” Abu Swareh said. Even if her daughter and grandchildren survive the attacks, there is an extreme lack of food and water, which has led her daughter and her family to resort to drinking saltwater. On Friday, November 24, a humanitarian pause between Israel and Hamas went into effect. As Israel and Hamas traded captives and prisoners, the pause has been extended twice, most recently on Wednesday evening. Asked if the pause provided any relief, Najjar was dismissive. “There’s supposed to be aid coming in but there’s still no food or water or help on the ground,” he said. “And with the winter conditions, it’ll only get worse.” Najjar said the images he’s seen in the media recall other humanitarian catastrophes like Yemen and Somalia. “I hope the Arab countries, the West, and the rest of the world start to genuinely support Gaza,” he added. “Right now, it’s all talk.” Back at the Abu Swareh residence on Thursday, Fatmeh knew her relief counted for little as the fighting could restart at any moment. Furthermore, the acts of aggression haven’t entirely stopped, she said. “Today, they shot at them from [Israeli] ships in the sea.” Reports from Palestinian media said Israeli navy boats shot missiles at the coast of Gaza. Nearby, sat Fatmeh’s son, Mohammad. He sat quietly until his mother encouraged him to speak. He started, but laboured over his words, choosing them carefully. “This ceasefire is meaningless,” he eventually said. “It’s a ceasefire without a ceasefire.” On the morning of Friday, December 1, fighting resumed in Gaza.

"‘Bomb­ing every­where’: As Is­rael re­news war, my eight-year-old has ques­tions",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/1/bombing-everywhere-as-israel-renews-war-my-eight-year-old-has-questions,"My daughter asks me if the war is on again. I tell her it never stopped. Our lives, dreams and hopes don’t matter to the world. Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip —After a week-long temporary truce, the Israeli air strikes haveunfortunately resumed. The past seven days of relative calm have come to an end, and the familiar sounds of bombings, explosions, aircraft, artillery, naval boats and live ammunition are back. These were our daily experiences for seven weeks before the truce, and we had become adept at distinguishing between them, including the distinctive sounds of rockets from Gaza and Israeli bombings. This morning, at 7:00 sharp, theviolent soundsresumed from land, air and sea, evoking new memories of sadness on my family’s faces. My brother, opening the window to see what was happening, remarked, “Bombing is from everywhere.” The toughest question came from my eight-year-old daughter, Banias, asking if this was war again. My husband explained that the past “calm” days were just a temporary truce, and the war had not ended. Banias struggled to comprehend this strange cycle of war, pause, and then war again. Reflecting on Banias’s confusion, I wondered how a young mind grapples with the illogical nature of war—pauses followed by resumptions. Fifty-six days of conflict were apparently insufficient to secure a ceasefire. Yesterday, displaced people living in tents amid dire conditions nearAl-Aqsa Martyrs Hospitalin the central Gaza Strip expressed distress, fear and despair, desiring not a temporary truce but a lasting ceasefire to return to their homes, even if damaged. Their fear – that a new resumption of war would mean that Israel would move to bomb the south. Early today, their expectations came true as Israeli troops threw leaflets asking people living in east Khan Younis to move to Rafah at the southern edge of Gaza. As air strikes persist from north to south, I ponder the multitude of wars faced by the people of Gaza: displacement, destruction, humiliation, tent living, thirst, hunger and the anxiety of temporary pauses followed by renewed bombing. What should the people of Gaza do to make the world feel for them? How can the world allow the genocide to continue again? How will we return to the bloodshed again and worry about the loss of our loved ones? How, how and how? I know that these questions will remain unanswered. The past 56 days have taught me, as they have shown to all of the people of Gaza, that our fears, lives, pain, hopes and dreams are not included in the calculations of this world.",Published On 1 Dec 2023

Combat between Israel and Hamas was renewed on Friday following the expiry of a weeklong truce. An agreement on extending the pause in fighting was not reached before the 7am (05:00 GMT) deadline. The deal, which started on November 24 and was twice extended, had produced a pause in the fighting and allowed an increase in aid flows into Gaza, while scores of Israelis taken prisoner on October 7 were exchanged for hundreds of jailed Palestinians. However, hostilities resumed immediately as the latest deadline passed. Smoke billowed over the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis following Israeli strikes, with deaths recorded in both places. In Khan Younis, a group of men chanted “God is greatest” as they rushed through the streets carrying a body wrapped in a white shroud. At the hospital reception, 10-year-old Lina Hamdan said: “We were getting ready to sleep when I heard a bomb. My brothers started screaming.” In Rafah, a young man rushed a badly wounded child out of a refugee camp hit by an explosion, while others could be seen pulling a motionless person from the rubble. Marwan al-Hams, the director of al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah, where many Palestinians fled after being told by Israel to leave the north of the territory, said strikes had killed at least nine people in the city, including four children. In the north of the Gaza Strip, the fireball from a large explosion could be seen from across the border in the Israeli city of Sderot. Speaking from a hospital in Gaza, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said on Friday that a bomb had landed “literally 50 metres away”. “I cannot overstate how much the capacity of hospitals has been reduced,” he said. “We cannot see more children with the wounds of war, with the burns, with the shrapnel littering their body, with the broken bones.” “This is a war on children,” he added.",Published On 1 Dec 2023

Fierce fighting has resumed in Gaza after a weeklong pause in hostilities between Israel and Hamas, with Palestinians left with nowhere safe to shelter from the widening offensive and sirens blaring across southern Israel. Minutes after the truce expired on Friday, the Israeli military startedpounding Gaza, accusing Hamas of violating the pause first by launching rockets. Al Jazeera’s journalists in the enclave reported heavy gunfire and Israeli shelling in the north, central and southern parts of Gaza. “The Gaza Strip is under heavy artillery and even aerial bombardment by the [Israeli] occupation forces,” said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “In the coming hours, we might witness a surging increase in the number of Israeli strikes across the territory.”  This is a modal window.

Israel has been dropping leaflets into parts of southern Gaza, warning civilians to evacuate southwards towards Rafah, on the border with Egypt. The leaflets dropped in Khan Younis said the city is now a “dangerous battle zone”. Until the truce that started on November 24, Israel’s response to the Hamas attack on October 7 was largely concentrated on northern Gaza. Thousands of residents fled to the south, taking shelter in areas includingKhan Younis. But with an estimated 1.7 million people displaced, Palestinians face an untenable situation with no route to return north and attacks across the enclave. “Right now, sounds of Israeli explosions can be heard in the south, an area that the Israeli authorities had recommended as safe for civilians to flee,” Abu Azzoum said. “This [resumption of fighting] brings Palestinians only one option – that they will live again under the Israeli bombardment that will destroy all means of life inside the Gaza Strip,” he added.

Khan Younis resident Mansour Shouman said he has been “surrounded by tens of thousands” of people who have come to the Nasser hospital to seek refugee. Shouman, who told Al Jazeera that he was sheltering in a tent beside the maternity ward, said that more than “10 people have been killed [and] brought in ambulances close by me”. “There is a general feeling of anxiety between the civilians here, people do not know what’s going to happen next. The belief is that negotiations are still going. People are hopeful that a ceasefire will hold in the next few hours,” Shouman said. He added that people are staying put wherever they are as it’s too dangerous to travel anywhere. “Despite all challenges, Palestinians are steadfast on their land here, they don’t want any repeat of 1948 and 1967. We are not leaving our land to go anywhere, we will try to strive against what the occupation here is doing,” Shouman said. “People are asking ‘Where should we go?’ Gaza is unprepared for all of this,” said journalist Hind Khoudary, reporting from Khan Younis. As it prepares for the next stage of the war, the Israeli army also published a map dividing Gaza into hundreds of small zones, saying that these individual areas will be used to notify Palestinian civilians of active fighting. According to an announcement published on the army’s website, Palestinians are asked to follow security updates within the new zones. Anyone living in or near one of the numbered zones must follow instructions for that area issued by the army, the announcement said. UNICEF spokesperson James Elder, who is in Khan Younis, told Al Jazeera that Palestinians in Gaza are once again full of fear after the resumption of Israel’s military offensive. Speaking from outside the Nasser hospital, he said ambulances had already started transporting people to the largest active remaining complex in the enclave. “Hospital staff obviously have already been working 24/7,” he said. “This hospital, despite the immense efforts of its brave health staff, cannot take another assault. People cannot take another assault.” Elder also said that thousands of people sleep in the Nasser hospital – beyond the fact it is working at 200 percent capacity for patients who need medical care.  Gaza’s Ministry of Health said Israeli air strikes have killed at least 54 people across the strip on Friday. More than 15,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,150 children, have been killed in Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200.",Published On 1 Dec 2023

Air strikes hit the south of the besieged enclave, including the community of Abasan east of the town of Khan Younis, Gaza’s interior ministry said. Another air raid hit a home northwest of Gaza City. Loud, continuous explosions were heard coming from across the Strip and black smoke billowed from the territory. In Israel, sirens blared at three communal farms near Gaza, warning of incoming rocket fire and suggesting that Hamas had also resumed its attacks. The Israeli military’s announcement of the renewed strikes came only 30 minutes after the temporary pause, which began on November 24, expired at 7am (05:00 GMT) on Friday. At least 21 Palestinians were killed across Gaza in the first two hours after Israel’s army resumed its attacks, Gaza’s health ministry said. This included two people killed in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza; seven in Maghazi in central Gaza; one in Khan Younis; two in Hamad town; and nine in Rafah, all in the southern Gaza Strip. Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million is now crammed into the south with no exit after Israel instructed hundreds of thousands to evacuate the north during its initial bombardment.

The prisoners – including 23 children and seven women – were released hours after eight Israeli captives were freed by Hamas.

Hamas freed two Israeli female captives in a first release on Thursday, followed by six more captives later in the evening, according to Israeli authorities. Since it came into force on November 24, the truce has resulted in Hamas freeing 110 captives, including 80 Israelis. The majority of the 30 non-Israeli captives freed were from Thailand, released under a separate agreement. Israel has freed 240 Palestinian prisoners in exchange.

Is­raeli air strikes pound Gaza as truce ends,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/fighting-resumes-in-israel-gaza-war,"Air strikes, heavy shelling and casualties reported in Gaza as Israel accuses Hamas of breaking agreement. Heavy fighting has broken out across the Gaza Strip, as the Israeli military resumed combat operations against Hamas after efforts to extend the truce failed. The resumption of hostilities came at about 7am local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday, as the deadline for the end of the week-long pause passed. Israeli air strikes have been reported across the enclave, including the south, which was previously said to be safe for fleeing civilians. Gaza’s health ministry said that dozens of Palestinians were killed and injured during the initial resumption of Israeli strikes. Reports of rockets and gunfire had emerged in the hour before the temporary truce expired. Israel said that Hamas had violated the agreement. Efforts to extend the pause had been ongoing. There was no comment from mediator Qatar, but there are reports that talks between Qatari and Egyptian mediators are continuing. “Hamas violated the operational pause, and in addition, fired toward Israeli territory,” the Israeli army said in apost on Xon Friday. “The IDF has resumed combat against the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that Hamas did not agree to release further hostages, infringing the terms of the truce. Hamas has yet to respond. “With the resumption of fighting we emphasise: The Israeli government is committed to achieving the goals of the war – to free our hostages, to eliminate Hamas, and to ensure that Gaza will never pose a threat to the residents of Israel,” Netanyahu’s office said. “What Israel did not achieve during the fifty days before the truce, it will not achieve by continuing its aggression after the truce,” said a Hamas statement. There are now reports of heavy gunfire and Israeli shelling in the north, central and southern parts of Gaza, Al Jazeera’s journalists in the enclave reported, saying aircraft and drones could be heard overhead. “The Gaza Strip is under heavy artillery and even aerial bombardment by the [Israeli] occupation forces,” said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “In the coming hours, we might witness a surging increase in the number of Israeli strikes across the territory.” Our correspondent said that in the north, a residential building was destroyed in the Jabalia refugee camp; in central Gaza, tanks were shelling near Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps; and in the south, a house in Rafah was completely destroyed. According to Gaza’s health ministry, at least 21 people were killed as Israel resumed its attacks, including two in the north, seven in central Gaza and 12 in the south. “Right now, sounds of Israeli explosions can be heard in the south, an area that the Israeli authorities had recommended as safe for civilians to flee,” Abu Azzoum said. “This [resumption of fighting] brings Palestinians only one option – that they will live again under the Israeli bombardment that will destroy all means of life inside the Gaza Strip,” he added. Israeli forces have been dropping leaflets in Khan Younis warning civilians to evacuate southwards towards Rafah, on the border with Egypt. The city was also targeted by Israeli air raids on Friday. “People are asking ‘Where should we go?’ Gaza is unprepared for all of this,” said journalist Hind Khoudary, reporting from Khan Younis. The evacuation warnings suggest Israel is now planning to further target areas in the south of the Strip after concentrating most of its bombardment on the north of the enclave in the weeks before the truce. The seven-day pause in fighting, which began on November 24 and was extended twice, had allowed for the exchange of dozens of hostages held in Gaza for hundreds of Palestinianprisonersand facilitated the entry of humanitarian aid into the shattered coastal Strip. During the truce, Hamas freed 110 captives, including 80 Israelis. In exchange, Israel released 240 Palestinians, including women and children, many of whom have been held in administrative detention for months without charge. However, during the same period, Israel has arrested nearly as many Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem as it has released. The pause also allowed desperately needed aid into the enclave, although supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel remain insufficient for Gaza’s 2.3 million people.  This is a modal window.

‘I missed my fam­i­ly’: Tears and smiles as Thai cap­tives come home,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/i-missed-my-family-tears-and-smiles-as-thai-captives-come-home,"Nine Thai nationals remain in captivity in Gaza after weeks of diplomacy for their release. Bangkok, Thailand –Three words in English gave Thai migrant worker Khomkrit Chombua the first signal in 50 days that his captors in Gaza were about to release him: “You go Thailand.” Khomkrit was among 17 Thai captives who arrived in Bangkok on Thursday, tired and visibly thin but appearing in good spirits. The returnees were mobbed at the airport by tearful relatives overwhelmed with relief that their loved ones, who had left home to earn money for their families back home, had returned alive after being caught up in someone else’s war. Khomkrit Chombua, 28, a shy man of few words from Surin province near the Cambodia border, was smothered with hugs by three of his cousins after he arrived at Suvarnabhumi Airport dressed in a T-shirt with Thai and Israeli flags printed on it. “I felt so happy,” he told Al Jazeera, recalling the moment his captors told him he would be freed. “I missed my family, I was worried about them … I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to make it out.” Like the other freed captives, Khomkrit thanked everyone involved in his rescue but declined to speak about the conditions of his captivity. Thailand has been among the countries most affected by the war between Israel and Hamas. At least 39 Thais were killed during Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel, all poor rural migrant labourers working on Israeli farms close to Gaza, and 32 others were taken captive. Nine Thai nationals still remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip, according to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has pledged to spare no effort to get them back. Six other freed captives are in Israel waiting to return home. “Our mission to rescue our Thai workers … is not yet complete,” Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara said at Suvarnabhumi Airport, explaining his emotion at seeing his compatriots freed after weeks of painstaking diplomacy. “For the nine Thais who are still being held, we will do our very best and chase every avenue we have to bring them home.” Khomkrit had been working in Israel for over four years when he was kidnapped, about one year short of the maximum period Thai migrant workers are allowed to work in Israel without renewing their visa. Like most of the roughly 30,000 Thais working in Israel, he was employed in agriculture, drawing on skills and experience of outdoor work learned in the rice basket region of Isan, where his home province of Surin is located. Under a since-lapsed labour agreement signed between Israel and Thailand in 2011, Thai migrant workers were guaranteed a minimum wage of 5,300 shekels a month ($2,000), several times more than most can expect to earn back home cultivating rice, rubber or sugar. The agreement also called for increased scrutiny of the recruitment process, while Israeli officials said it would reduce by up to 80 percent the $10,000 in broker fees paid by Thai workers. For many Thais, whose average daily wage is about 300 baht (around $10), working in Israel has been seen as a shortcut to home ownership or buying land for their family. While Khomkrit’s sojourn was brutally cut short, he said he was still grateful to be able to work overseas and build his family a home. “I was a delivery driver at Tesco Lotus in Bangkok before I went to Israel. I was living hand-to-mouth pretty much, a decade of savings still wouldn’t have been enough to do it,” he said of his aspirations to buy a home. The World Bank said this week that Thailand remains the country in East Asia and the Pacific with the highest “income-based inequality”, with the richest 10 percent earning nearly 50 percent of total income. Thailand’s household debt stands at 90 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin this week promised to crack down on loan sharks, which have ensnared numerous communities in debt traps. For most young people in farming communities like Khomkrit’s, moving to the city or working overseas feels like the only option, even if that means accepting risks to their safety. “It’s always about the money, right?” Khomkrit’s cousin Piyanus Phujuttu, 27, told Al Jazeera. “In Thailand, with this low minimum wage, you can’t achieve more than putting food in your mouth.” Amid the scenes of joy on Thursday, the realities of life for Thailand’s poorest were not far from view. Waiting for her husband Wichian Temthong to enter the arrivals area at  Suvarnabhumi Airport, Malai Is-sara said he had been taken hostage shortly after starting work. “He went there to follow his dreams: building his parents a house, paying for school for our two young boys,” she told Al Jazeera. “I still think he’ll go back out to chase his dreams.”",Published On 1 Dec 2023

Here’s a recap of today’s key events. From the very decision to follow the attacks of October 7 with a hard-armed response, the military approach was advocated most aggressively by Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained a hawkish posture throughout the crisis, but he preferred to appear as the overall leader, leaving the strictly military affairs in the hands of the former career soldier. On Monday, the last day of the original four-day pause and before the announcement of its first extension, by two days, Gallant made his desires and intentions clear, telling a group of officers and soldiers that the truce would not last much longer: “You have a few days. When we return to fighting, we will apply the same force and more, and we will fight across the whole of the Strip.” It can be assumed that Gallant represents and voices the policy of the Israeli cabinet towards Gaza much more accurately and precisely than his troubled and embattled prime minister, who is increasingly merely trying to secure his political survival. Gallant wants to continue the war because he believes the military can be more successful the sooner the fighting resumes. But he might have other things on his mind: Despite the Israeli political tradition of not questioning national leadership during an ongoing war, Netanyahu is increasingly being grilled by his former associates, not just political opponents.

Reporting from Blantyre, Malawi The departure of hundreds of Malawians to Israel to work as farm labourers has sparked a debate within the Southern African country, which is looking to raise much-needed foreign currency amid a cash crunch. On November 25, the first tranche of 221 workers left for Israel. Subsequent flights are expected in the days to come, according to a statement from the Ministry of Labour, which did not mention numbers. Details about the programme were first made public on November 23 by Kondwani Nankhumwa, leader of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, as he spoke in parliament, questioning the secrecy of the deal and describing it as “an evil transaction”. “[The] government has gone into such an agreement with Israeli companies when it is fully aware that there is war. No sane parent can send his or her child to work in a country that is at war,” Nankhumwa told journalists after. Read more here. The US secretary of state has asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to protect positions hosting American personnel, the US State Department says. Blinken’s request comes aftera slew of attackson US military personnel that Washington has blamed on Iran-backed groups. Iran haswarnedof the “inevitable expansion” of the Gaza conflict due to Israel’s heightened aggression. US and coalition troops have been attacked over 40 times in Iraq and Syria by Iran-backed forces as tensions soar over Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, causing the injury of dozens of US troops. The US hasstruck back, killing Iran-backed fighters in Iraq. The attack is the latest on Syria by Israel, which has targeted airports, warehouses and other facilities it believes to be linked to Iran, Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed groups. We’ll have more on this as soon as we get it. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that four hostages, Eliyahu Margalit, Mia Goren, Ronen Engel and Aryeh Zalmanovich, had died in Gaza. Hagari said that the families of the dead captives had been notified, although he did not specify how the captives had died, nor when. The Times of Israel also reported that a statement issued on behalf of Kibbutz Be’eri on Friday announced the death of one of its residents, Ofra Keider, in Gaza. She had been taken captive on October 7. Another captive, Guy Iluz, was announced dead by the high school he graduated from, with no further details provided, the website said. Earlier on Friday, Israel announced the death of Ofir Tzarfati, who was also taken captive on October 7. The Gaza Government Media Office posted on Telegram that the crossing with Egypt, the only operational route into Gaza, will be open on Saturday, denying rumours that it will be closed. The seven-day truce between Hamas and Israel collapsed this morning. Both sides blame each other for the breakdown, but as Israel resumed its bombardment of the Strip, 178 Palestinians were killed and 589 others were injured in less than 24 hours, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said.

Blinken urges Is­rael to pro­tect civil­ians amid tough Gaza truce talks,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/blinken-pledges-support-for-israel-as-gaza-truce-extend-for-third-time,"Mediators Qatar and Egypt push for further extension to pause in hostilities as deal holds for a week. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told Israel that it must account for the safety of Palestinian civilians before resuming any military operations in Gaza, where a week-long truce has allowed the exchange of captives held by Hamas for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. As negotiators from Qatar and Egypt were in difficult talks on Thursday for a new two-day extension to thepause in fightingbetween Hamas and Israel, the United States’s top diplomat made his third trip to the region since the Israel-Palestinianwar began on October 7. Blinken said Washington remains committed to supporting Israel’s right to self-defence, but also stepped up calls for Israel to comply with international law and protect civilians if it starts major military operations in southern Gaza. His message was in keeping with the administration of US President Joe Biden’s shifting rhetoric on the war, which began as a full-throated embrace of Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks but gradually tempered as the number of Palestinian civilian casualties began to rise dramatically. More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, including more than 6,000 children. The death toll and scale of destruction have prompted widespread international criticism. As Israel bombardedhospitals, schools and homes, the Gaza Ministry of Health said at least 7,000 people are still missing or feared buried under the rubble, and more than 36,000 Palestinians have been wounded, many with life-altering injuries. With 26 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals out of service, their chances of getting treatment are slim. According to Ibrahim Abusharif of Northwestern University in Qatar, Blinken’s continued trips to Israel and meetings with Israeli leaders “doesn’t seem like it’s moving the needle in any direction”. “What set the tone was the early rhetoric from the Biden administration that gave unconditional support for what turned out to be a genocidal war,” he told Al Jazeera. “Blinken can try to soften his rhetoric and apply pressure, but in the end, it won’t bring back the dead in Gaza.” During a meeting in Jerusalem, Blinken assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he could count on US support. But, he said that such support requires Israel’s “compliance with international humanitarian law,” and “urged Israel to take every possible measure to avoid civilian harm,” the US Department of State said. To prevent a further significant increase in civilian casualties, Blinken “stressed the imperative of accounting for humanitarian and civilian protection needs in southern Gaza before any military operations there,” the department said. Later on Thursday, US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Washington supports the resumption of fighting in Gaza after the end of the truce, which Netanyahu has affirmed would happen. “We continue to believe that Israel has the right and responsibility to go after Hamas … and as they make that decision, they’ll continue to find support from the United States,” Kirby told reporters. Blinken also “urged immediate steps to hold settler extremists accountable for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank” and said the US places great importance on the resumption of a peace process that would eventually lead to the creation of a Palestinian state. Israeli officials have pledged to the US on multiple occasions thatIsraeli settlerviolence will be punished, but Netanyahu’s office released a statement about the meeting with Blinken that contained no mention of either settler violence or a two-state solution. Netanyahu said he told Blinken, “We will continue this war until we achieve the three goals – to release all our abductees, to eliminate Hamas completely and to ensure that Gaza will never again face such a threat.” Blinken also met Israel’s war cabinet in Jerusalem before travelling to the occupied West Bank for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and then back to Tel Aviv where he held talks with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and opposition leader Yair Lapid.

In his meeting with Abbas, Blinken focused on efforts to increase the delivery ofhumanitarian aidto Gaza and condemned Jewish settler attacks against Palestinians in the occupiedWest Bank. Blinken told Abbas “he would continue to insist on full accountability for those responsible,” and that Washington “remains committed to advancing tangible steps for a Palestinian state,” the State Department said. Abbas presented Blinken with “a comprehensive file documenting Israeli occupation crime in Gaza, and the West Bank, including Jerusalem”, Palestinian state news agency Wafa reported.  Israeli army raids have taken place on a daily basis across the West Bank since the war began. The total number of people arrested since October 7 is now more than 3,325, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS). At least 248 Palestinians, including more than 50 children, have been killed in the occupied West Bank since October 7. More than 2,750 have been injured. Abbas also raised the topic of the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, particularly in light of increased attackers from settlers. The top US diplomat will close out his latest Middle East tour in the United Arab Emirates on Friday, where he will discuss the Gaza situation with Arab leaders gathered in Dubai for the COP28 United Nations climate change conference. Blinken’s meetings came as Israel and Hamas agreed at the last minute to athird extension of a truceunder which Israel has paused most military activity in return for the release of captives held by Hamas. Qatar, which has been mediating between the two sides, said the agreement was being extended under the same terms as in the past, under which Hamas has released 10 Israeli captives per day in exchange for 30 Palestinian prisoners. Late on Thursday, the Israeli military said two released captives have been handed over to its soldiers by the Red Cross and the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club released a list containing the names of 30 Palestinian prisoners – eight women and 22 children – who are expected to be released later in the day. But as the number of civilians held in Gaza dwindles, Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator, said the current iteration of the truce deal will have to be renegotiated. “Can one do that in time to extend this cessation without getting back to the intention of the Israeli political and military leadership, which is to resume its all-out assault on Gaza? They are being clear that that’s where they want to go,” Levy told Al Jazeera. “The Americans are apparently saying, ‘Hey, we’re with you on you continuing your military mission, but can you do it differently’ – that sounds like a disingenuous position to me. Why would anyone have faith that Israel will do this differently.”  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

Pales­tine ad­vo­cates de­cry MSNBC’s can­cel­la­tion of Meh­di Hasan news show,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/palestine-advocates-decry-msnbcs-cancellation-of-mehdi-hasan-news-show,"Channel president says change aims to put network in ‘better position’ for the 2024 US elections, The Hill reports. Washington, DC –MSNBC has cancelled Mehdi Hasan’s weekend TV programme, sparking anger from many Palestinian rights supporters who consider the progressive host a rare critic of Israeli policies on United States cable news. The decision, first reported by the news websiteSemaforon Thursday, came amid what advocates describe as a crackdown on criticism against Israel in the media, at universities and in the arts. The country is currently conducting amilitary offensive in Gazathat has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, prompting human rights concerns. Left-wing Congressman Ro Khanna said cancelling the show during the conflict is “bad optics” for the network. “As a strong supporter of free speech, MSNBC owes the public an explanation for this decision,” Khanna wrote in a social media post. “Why would they choose to do this now?” Semafor reported that Hasan’s show will be replaced by extending news anchor Ayman Mohyeldin’s self-titled programme to two hours. Mohyeldin, who is Arab American, is also a critic of the Israeli government. Hasan will be retained by the network as an on-screen analyst, US media outlets indicated. In a note to staff quoted by the publication The Hill, MSNBC President Rashida Jones said the reshuffle aims to “better position” the network as it heads into the 2024 US elections. MSNBC did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. Palestinian American human rights lawyerNoura Erakatcalled the programme “more needed than ever”. “He should be amplified, not shut down,” Erakat wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.  A persistent interviewer known for confronting guests about false claims and past statements, Hasan previously worked as an Al Jazeera host. He also was a senior columnist at The Intercept, a news website. This month on his programme, he deployed his trademark interviewing style to question Israeli government adviser Mark Regev about false claims promoted by Israeli officials. In one example, Hasan pointed to an instance in which a calendar in a Gaza hospital was presented as a list of Hamas operatives. “We shouldn’t blindly believe anything Hamas says. But why should we believe what your government says, either?” Hasan asked. After a lengthy back-and-forth, Regev acknowledged that Israel may have committed “mistakes” in putting out such information. Author Sarah Kendzior pointed to that segment as she questioned MSNBC’s decision to nix Hasan’s show. “They canceled Mehdi Hasan for interviews like this — evidence-based and willing to challenge power — and it is doubtful he will be the only journalist pushed out for daring to practice journalism,” she wrote in a social media post. On Thursday, US journalist David Sirota noted that Hasan has reported critically on both Republicans and Democrats. “Canceling him is another step in the deliberate homogenization of news content into pure red-vs-blue infotainment,” Sirota wrote on X.

Re­lief as Thai hostages re­turn home amid fears for those still held in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/relief-as-thai-hostages-return-home-amid-fears-for-those-still-held-in-gaza,"Group of 17 Thai nationals return from a total of 23 who have been released by Hamas, with nine still captive in Gaza. Thai hostages freed after weeks being held captive by Hamas in Gaza have spoken of their relief after returning to Bangkok, where they were welcomed home by overjoyed relatives. A group of 17 Thai nationals arrived on a flight from Israel on Thursday after Bangkok’s foreign ministry and Thai Muslim groups worked to negotiate their release. At least 32 Thais were abducted by Hamas fighters when they attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping about 240 others, according to Israeli authorities. At least 39 Thais were killed in theattack, according to the Thai government. When the group of freed captives arrived at the airport in Bangkok, they asked for a moment of silence to mourn the Thais killed in the attack. “I’m saddened that my 39 fellow workers who died, and would like everybody to take a moment to mourn their loss,” the group’s representative Uthai Saengnuan told reporters. The returnees stood in a line, some wearing shirts with the Thai and Israeli flags.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

Pornsawan Pinakalo, who was working on a potato farm when he was kidnapped, told reporters that he wanted to see all the Thai captives released. At least nine other Thai nationals are held in Gaza. “It would be better if all of our friends could come back,” he said. “When I was there I tried not to think too much about what might happen, because I was sad I wouldn’t see my family again.” Before the Israel-Hamas war, about 30,000 Thai labourers worked in the agriculture sector, making the group one of Israel’s largest migrant worker groups. Since the war erupted, 9,000 Thais have been repatriated. “All Thais were worried about you,” Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said told the returnees via a video call as they gathered for the news conference at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport. Thai migrant workers in Israel come mainly from the Southeast Asian nation’s rural northeast, seeking higher pay to send home to their families. Family members greeted their relatives at the airport and spoke of their relief at their return. “I’ve been following the news. At first, when his name didn’t appear as a hostage I was shocked thinking that he would be dead,” Pornsawan’s mother Lumpong Pinakalo, 51, told the AFP news agency. She urged the families of the nine Thais still held captive in Gaza to stay positive. “If your child has been named as a hostage, I would say to have faith, because there is still hope.” Nattawaree Moolkan, the only woman among the Thai hostages, wept as she said, “Thank you for all your encouragement.” Reporting from Bangkok, Al Jazeera’s Jessica Washington said the Thai government was focused on efforts to bring back the remaining Thai nationals held in Gaza. “It [Bangkok] is working with Qatar, Malaysia, and other countries to secure their release,” she said, adding that the government has instructed journalists not to ask the group about the conditions of their detention.

Ten of the hostages were released last Friday, as a truce began following weeks of negotiations brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. Seven others were released by Hamas in the days that followed. The group recuperated at a hospital in Israel as authorities made preparations to fly them home, Thai officials said. “The support of friends and allies helped secure the release of Thai hostages,” Foreign Minister Pranpree Bahiddha-Nukara told reporters, adding that the government would continue its efforts in securing the release of those who remain in Gaza. Pranpree said he held had talks with his counterparts in several Middle Eastern countries with Hamas contacts. He was previously in Cairo and Doha for talks. A Thai Muslim group that held direct talks with Hamas said their efforts were crucial in securing the early release of Thai hostages. On the first day of the Israel-Hamas truce, 10 Thai hostages were released without condition. Six more Thais were released on Tuesday and Wednesday and were undergoing medical checks, the foreign ministry said, taking the total number freed to 23, with nine still in captivity. After the Hamas attack, Israel launched a massive campaign of air, artillery and naval bombardment alongside a ground offensive into Gaza, killing more than 15,000 people, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian officials.",Published On 30 Nov 2023
"Is­rael-Pales­tine war: ‘Cease­fire’ or ‘pause’, what have world lead­ers said?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/11/30/israel-palestine-war-ceasefire-or-pause-what-have-world-leaders-said,"Al Jazeera analysed hundreds of world leaders' speeches to see how language is shaping the Israel-Gaza war and its resolution. ""We are at war. Not an operation, not a round [of fighting], at war,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahudeclaredto his fellow Israelis on October 7, following a surprise attack by the Palestinian armed group Hamas that killed an estimated 1,200 people in Israel. Within hours, the United States, Israel's closest ally, condemned the attacks as ""unconscionable"". President Joe Biden affirmed, ""Israel has the right to defend itself,"" echoing sentiments from Israel's allies worldwide. Over the next seven weeks, Israel went on to drop more than 40,000 tonnes ofexplosiveson Gaza,killingmore than 15,000 people, including at least 6,150 children, and levelled entire neighbourhoods. Following several failed resolutions at the United Nations and a flurry ofdiplomatic efforts, a four-day Gaza truce, agreed upon by Hamas and Israel, finally took effect on November 24 and was laterextendedfor an additional three days. As the war continues on the ground, a parallel battle is being waged through the exchange of words on the world stage. To understand how language is shaping the current war, Al Jazeera examined all the speeches and statements given by 118 United Nations member states at all the UN Security Council (UNSC) and General Assembly (UNGA) sessions between October 7 and November 15. In addition to the UN statements, we analysed hundreds of speeches and statements given by the leaders of Israel and Palestine, five permanent members of the UNSC — the US, UK, France, China and Russia, as well as eight regional players, namely Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey. Many countries have called for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire, ending all hostilities, while Israel's allies have only called for a pause in fighting. Those avoiding the call for a “ceasefire” echo Israel’s sentiment that Hamas should not be given any respite in fighting and the war should only end after the armed group's complete destruction. Many of these countries have called for peace or political resolution, but have fallen short of using the term “ceasefire”. According to theUnited Nations: While there is no universal definition of what a ceasefire entails, it typically includes a formal agreement to end the fighting and lays out a political process to de-escalate the conflict, such as withdrawing weapons or repositioning forces. A pause or truce is a temporary halt to fighting for an agreed-upon period. Our analysis found that the majority of countries (55 percent) specifically called for a “ceasefire” in Gaza while 23 percent of nations underscored the importance of a temporary halt in hostilities. The remaining 22 percent did not explicitly endorse either option. The majority of countries calling for a pause are European states as well as the US and Canada. TheBiden administrationhas called for “humanitarian pauses” in the war while firmly rejecting demands for a ceasefire, at least until Israel achieves its stated goal of eliminating Hamas. The majority calling for a ceasefire are those in the Global South, with the exception of a handful of European states, most notably France, Ireland, Russia and Spain. France has urged setting up a humanitarian truce which could lead eventually to a ceasefire. For Palestinians in Gaza like Tala Herzallah, a 21-year-old student at the Islamic University of Gaza, the role of the international community and organisations like the UN in helping end the war has been close to ""zero"". ""All international laws are being violated, and no one says anything. It's all just ink on paper,"" she told Al Jazeera. People are being bombed in hospitals, in schools. But all they do is condemn. Our blood is cheap byTala Herzallah - student in Gaza Moreover, like many Palestinians, Herzallah stressed that the conflict with Israel extends far beyond the tragic events of October 7. ""We (Gaza) have been under siege for more than 16 years, with pain, poverty and unemployment. Bombed every now and then.""",Published On 30 Nov 2023
‘We’re not here to beg’: Gaza res­i­dents’ anger over steep rise in prices,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/were-not-here-to-beg-gaza-residents-anger-over-steep-rise-in-prices,"People hoping to buy essentials like food, warm clothes during the pause in Israel’s bombing frustrated by price hikes. Deir el-Balah, central Gaza Strip –As the sounds of war quietened with the advent of the first truce between Israel and Hamas since October 7, the markets in the Gaza Strip have been flooded with shoppers, desperate to buy food supplies and winter clothes. But the cost of these products has skyrocketed, particularly for basic foodstuffs, sparking anger and resentment among shoppers who blame shopkeepers and stallholders for high prices. Imm Abdullah, who was displaced from her home in the Nassr neighbourhood in Gaza City a month ago after Israel ordered people in northern Gaza to move south, has been staying at one of the United Nations-run schools in Deir el-Balah with her 12 children and grandchildren. She said conditions in the school have become desperate, with no water and barely any provisions. “When the Israelis threw leaflets down at us, I left with my family wearing just my prayer clothes,” she said. “At the school, we barely get food assistance. The other day we got a can of tuna. How am I supposed to sustain my family with that?” Imm Abdullah had come to the town’s market to try to buy food and some warmer clothes for herself and her grandchildren, as the weather had turned cold. But after visiting different stalls to look for basic food products, her exasperation bubbled over. “I don’t believe the merchants when they say the prices are out of their control,” she said. “They can regulate prices and be considerate of the fact that we are going through exceptional times, which is not something they should take advantage of.” She rattled off a list of products that are now unaffordable: Bottled water, which used to be 2 shekels ($0.50), is now 4 or 5 shekels ($0.80-$1). A carton of eggs is 45 shekels ($12). A kilo of salt, which used to be 1 shekel is now 12 ($3.20), while sugar is 25 shekels ($6.70). “It’s so unfair,” Imm Abdullah said. “I can’t take it any more and some days I go sit by the sea and weep because I don’t know how to feed or sustain my family. Sometimes I wish we had stayed in our home and got bombed instead of going through this.” According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, thepoverty ratein the Gaza Strip has reached 53 percent, with one-third (33.7 percent) of Gaza residents living in extreme poverty. Approximately 64 percent of households in Gaza are without enough food, and unemployment is at 47 percent – one of the highest rates in the world. According to Elhasan Bakr, an economic analyst based in Gaza, the price distortion has led to inflation of between 300 and 2,000 percent for various products. Even before October 7, a 17-year Israeli blockade on the coastal enclave had resulted in the loss of $35bn to the Palestinian economy. “The latest Israeli aggression has been another nail in the coffin of Gaza’s economy,” Bakr told Al Jazeera. “The direct loss to the private sector has surpassed $3bn, while the indirect losses are more than $1.5bn.” The agricultural sector, he added, has suffered a direct loss of $300m. “This includes the uprooting and bulldozing of fruitful trees in the agricultural lands in the north and east near the Israeli fence, which means that it will be another few years before farmers can reap what they sow,” he explained. “We are talking about a total paralysis of economic activity in Gaza. There are 65,000 economic facilities – ranging from the agricultural to the service industries – in the private sector which have been either destroyed or stopped working because of the war. This has resulted in a huge loss of jobs, which in turn leads to a complete lack of food security.” Furthermore, the small amount of aid that has been allowed by Israel to enter Gaza is insufficient to cover the needs of the almost one million displaced people staying at UN schools for even one day. “From October 22 to November 12 – in those 20 days – fewer than 1,100 trucks entered the Gaza Strip,” Bakr said. “Fewer than 400 of these trucks carried food products. Barely 10 percent of Gaza’s food sector needs are met. This is nowhere near enough, especially when you consider the fact that, before October 7, at least 500 trucks used to enter the Strip on a daily basis.” The Gaza Strip, he added, would need 1,000 to 1,500 trucks a day to deliver the needs of the population of 2.3 million. In the Deir el-Balah market, Mohammed Yasser Abu Amra stands over the bags of spices and grains that he sells each day that the truce lasts. “The war has affected everything, from delivery costs to supplies,” the 28-year-old said. “Whatever I have now, once that is finished I won’t have the money to buy the same products because it’ll be more expensive, so that leaves me no choice but to raise prices to break even.” The main reason for the price rises, he said, is the closure of the border crossings, which has led to wholesale merchants selling products to shopkeepers at much higher prices. “Lentils used to be 2 shekels ($0.50) per kilo and we would sell it for 3 ($0.80),” Abu Amra said. “Now we buy it for 8 shekels ($2) and sell it for 10 ($2.60).” A bag of fava beans used to be 70 shekels ($18) and is now priced at 150 shekels ($40), he added, while previously a bag of cornflour would be 90 shekels ($19) but is now 120 shekels ($32). Abu Amra’s neighbour, also a shopkeeper, lost his home and warehouse in an Israeli attack, resulting in the loss of $8,000 worth of produce. Another shopper, Imm Watan Muheisan, said loudly – to the chagrin of nearby shopkeepers – that the current prices are “insane”. “If you have 1,000 shekels ($270), you can only buy a handful of food items,” she snapped. “One kilo of potatoes is now 25 shekels ($6.70), it used to be three kilos for 5 shekels ($1.70).” The mother of seven, who fled her home in the Shati (Beach) refugee camp east of Gaza City four weeks ago, is sheltering at the Deir el-Balah UN school for girls where, she said, she and her family are barely surviving. “We walked here and had to pass by the dead bodies on the street,” she said. “We used to wear our best clothes to market… we’re not here to beg.” Ahmad Abulnaja, an 18-year-old shopkeeper, began selling clothes with his older cousin Ali at the beginning of the war. He agreed that wholesale merchants are behind the increase in prices. “A tracksuit used to sell for 20 to 25 shekels ($5.30 – $6.70) but now it’s 45 ($12),” he said. “That is, the merchant I get my supplies from has raised the price because the supply is dwindling.” Price hikes are more pronounced on food products rather than clothes, but the demand for clothes is also high as displaced people try to buy warm clothes with winter setting in.  were forced to flee their homes in northern Gaza without bringing their possessions. Abulnaja’s cousin, Ali, said he believed the informal prices will be around for a long time because the scale of destruction in Gaza is so immense and the demand for products shows no sign of abating. “It’ll be a while before we have a solution,” he said. “Even if more products enter the Gaza Strip, there’s nothing to stop one merchant from selling a product at the price he sets, especially since northern Gaza is cut off from the rest of the Strip.” There is also the issue of the lack of compensation for businesses, the economic analyst, Elhasan Bakr, said. He pointed to the fact that in the aftermath of previous Israeli wars on the enclave, donor aid has centred on rebuilding housing units, rather than supporting the economy. According to UN estimates, the last four Israeli offensives on the Strip between 2009 and 2021 caused damage estimated at $5bn, but none of the damage in the 2014 and 2021 wars had been repaired. “We are talking about the devastation of the basic infrastructure which would need months to rebuild, from roads to communications towers to electricity installations and sanitary extensions,” Bakr said. But until then, the Palestinian economy will not recover unless there is a huge international effort in aid, and poverty and unemployment levels will reach new record highs. “Gaza at its present stage is unliveable,” Bakr said, adding that more than 300,000 people have lost their homes. “We need a minimum of five years just to go back to where we were before the war started.”",Published On 30 Nov 2023
‘Se­ri­ous doubt’ Is­rael com­ply­ing with in­ter­na­tion­al law: Spain PM Sanchez,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/serious-doubt-israel-complying-with-international-law-spains-sanchez,"In response, Israel recalls its envoy to Madrid, summons Spanish ambassador over ‘shameful statement’. Spain’s prime minister has expressed doubts that Israel is abiding by international law in its war on Gaza, given the high number of civilian casualties there. “The footage we are seeing and the growing numbers of children dying, I have serious doubt [Israel] is complying with international humanitarian law,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Thursday. “What we are seeing in Gaza is not acceptable,” he said in an interview with Spanish state-owned broadcaster TVE. Israel responded to what it called a “shameful statement” by Sanchez, by summoning the Spanish ambassador for a reprimand and recalling its envoy to Madrid for consultations. “Israel conducts itself and will continue to conduct itself in accordance with international law,” Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen posted on X. Eight weeks of Israeli bombardment and a ground offensive in Gaza have killed at least 15,000 Palestinians, uprooted three-quarters of the population of 2.3 million and sparked a debilitating humanitarian crisis, before a temporary truce was called on November 24. Last week Sanchez denounced Israel’s “indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians, including thousands of boys and girls” in the Gaza Strip. “Violence will only lead to more violence,” he said, while on a visit to the Egyptian side of Gaza’s Rafah crossing. He additionally called for apermanent ceasefire. On Thursday, Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas entered the seventh day of a truce that has given some respite to the bloodshed in Gaza but left Palestinians on edge over when the violence may resume. Spain has angered Israel with its official comments condemning the Israeli military’s bombardment of Gaza and encouraging Europe to discuss recognition of a Palestinian state. Cohen snapped back at Sanchez’s comments last week, saying such sentiments gave “terrorism a boost”, and summoned Spain’s ambassador for a “harsh rebuke”. Despite thediplomatic spat, Sanchez said Spain’s relationship with Israel was “correct” and that “friendly countries also have to say things to each other”. During the pause, Hamas has released 97 captives, while 210 Palestinian prisoners have been freed from Israeli prisons – many of whom wereheld without charge.  This is a modal window.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also made clear that the ongoing truce does not signal an end to the war. He has vowed to “return to fighting” to root out Hamas as soon as “this phase of returning our abductees is exhausted”. Also on Thursday, three people were killed and 16 injured after two gunmen opened fire at a bus stop on the outskirts ofJerusalem, Israeli police said. The attackers were also killed and Hamas subsequently claimed them as its members.",Published On 30 Nov 2023
Pho­tos: Gaza fam­i­lies re­turn to homes in ru­ins,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/30/we-will-rebuild-gaza-families-return-to-homes-in-ruins,"In Pictures Tea and cheese sandwiches are on the breakfast menu for Taghrid al-Najjar’s children. It should be an everyday moment, but their home in Gaza is now mostly rubble. The walls have collapsed, with furniture and appliances buried under concrete. Until the war, the 46-year-old mother had never left her farming village along the border with Israel in the southeast of the Strip. Since Friday a truce has paused the fighting between Israel and Hamas, allowing them to return to a neighbourhood in ruins. “It is only here that I feel good,” she said. Al-Najjar fled when Israeli bombardments started on October 7 in response to an attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 Israelis. For weeks she lived with nine members of her family in a Khan Younis school converted into a makeshift camp for displaced people. At least 15,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Israel’s war in Gaza, and al-Najjar said dozens of people in her wider extended family have died. As soon as the truce went into effect on Friday, she began making her way home to Abasan on foot. “I discovered that my house had been completely destroyed – 27 years of my life to build it and everything is gone!” she said. “For two days I couldn’t eat, then I told myself that I had to continue living. “My house is destroyed but my children are alive, so we will rebuild. We have already done it once, we can do it again.” Each night the family squeezes through a window to sleep in the only room where the walls have not entirely crumpled. Once there is a permanent ceasefire, Najjar said, they will pitch a tent, but only for “long enough to rebuild the house”. Her 64-year-old neighbour Jamil Abu Azra’s main concern was his four young grandchildren. “They can sleep anywhere, the problem is that they are afraid and they are traumatised,” he said. “Even us adults are afraid, but we pretend in front of the little ones.” Across the street, Bassem Abu Taaima contemplated the destroyed building where his family and his four brothers’ families had lived. “We are all farmers or taxi drivers. We really have nothing to do with the resistance,” he said, “so we don’t understand why all this is happening to us.” Wearing a jacket given to him by a neighbour, and shorts despite the biting cold, he said he would wait for the war to end before setting up a tent and starting to clear and rebuild. He has scoured the debris for warm clothes, although everything he has found has been burned or torn. Nearby, Naim Taaimat, 46, was building a shelter for his family from wood, some fabric and a few nails. “This is where I will live with my wife, our seven children and my mother after the war,” he said. More tents will be needed as his brothers – each has seven children – “have also lost their homes”, he added. The brothers “shed blood” to build the houses where the families’ possessions are now buried under rubble. Taaimat’s priority was to find his daughter Nivine’s trousseau, as she had been due to get married next week. He used a hammer to try to break up the concrete blocks before rummaging around with his bare hands. “Now she’s lost her house and her fiance also lost his house. So I have to find something so that she can still be a little happy.” Twelve-year-old Abdessamad interrupted, running in shouting: “We found an electric lamp and we have logs for the fire!” Sitting with his friends on a dirt floor near the United Nations school where he used to study, now partly wrecked by Israeli bombing, he laughed, sang and joked. “The war really scared us and it was horrible, but there is good news,” said his friend Nabil, aged eight. Laughing, and hoping his parents couldn’t overhear him, he explained: “The school’s destroyed and we won’t be able to go back for a while.”",Published On 30 Nov 2023
‘I am not an anti-Semi­te’: Pro-Pales­tine artists can­celled across Eu­rope,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/30/art-world-cancels-palestine-solidarity,"A celebrated Bangladeshi photojournalist, Palestinian filmmaker, and US author warn that cultural spaces are at risk of repression. In early October, when Israel began bombing Gaza, Bangladeshi photojournalist Shahidul Alam was busy co-curating a planned photography exhibition in Germany. Feeling worried, he took a break from his work and took to social media to decry Israel’s attacks on the densely populated Palestinian enclave. Alam is no stranger to human rights abuses and speaking his mind. In 2018, he was celebrated in Time magazine for his decades-long career documenting political unrest in Bangladesh. That year, he was detained for more than 100 days, accused of “false” statements after criticising Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in an interview. Since the onset of Israel’s war on Gaza, Alam has posted about the conflict dozens of times on Facebook to his 114,000 followers. On October 8, one post read: “The news of semi-naked Israeli bodies being paraded is horrendous and cannot be justified … I feel for all Palestinians and Israelis lives destroyed.” Another, on October 29, said: “This weekend’s horrific violence is the ugly reality of Israeli apartheid, the rotten fruit of decades of occupation of a stateless people divested of basic rights and freedoms.” On November 21, the German Biennale for Contemporary Photography dropped the veteran shooter, accusing him of anti-Semitism. “Various posts by Shahidul Alam on his Facebook channel after October 7 have given a platform to content that can be read as anti-Semitic and anti-Semitic content,” it said. Alam’s two Bangladeshi co-curators, Tanzim Wahab and Munem Wasif, resigned in solidarity, prompting organisers to scrap next year’s exhibition tour of three German cities. They said that among the allegedly anti-Semitic posts were an “uncommented interview by Shahidul Alam with the Palestinian ambassador to Bangladesh, a comparison of the current war with the Holocaust, and accusations of genocide by the state of Israel against the Palestinian population in Gaza”. They also complained that Alam had not deleted “racist and other comparable comments” against Israelis from his page, ostensibly made by some of his followers. Alam, Wahab and Wasif deny the allegations. “We have a moral responsibility to decide which side of history we will stand on,” they said in a statement on Tuesday. Alam told Al Jazeera: “I am an anti-Zionist which means I am against colonialism, settler colonialism, against racism, against apartheid and genocide. “I am not an anti-Semite, and it’s most unfortunate that Germany chooses to conflate the two, [as this] serves and furthers the white supremacist agenda.” The episode is one of many high-profile fallouts across the Western arts world in recent weeks over the Middle East war, focused on accusations of anti-Semitism. Several tense cases are focused in Germany, which has a special responsibility to Israel given its history arising from the Holocaust. However, artists, protesters and activists say Berlin’s crackdown confuses criticism of Israeli policies with anti-Jewish racism. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas, which governs the densely populated Strip, attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping more than 200. To date, Israel’s strikes, officially aimed at crushing the Palestinian group, have killed more than 15,000 people, among them many children. In the wake of the Hamas attack, the Frankfurt Book Fair “indefinitely postponed” an appearance by Palestinian author Adania Shibli, who was due to receive a prize for her novel Minor Detail on October 20. On November 13, Haitian-born curator Anais Duplan was left “speechless” after his Afrofuturism exhibition at Germany’s Museum Folkwang was abruptly cancelled by the museum’s director Peter Gorschluter. Gorschluter said Duplan’s social media posts “do not acknowledge the terroristic attack of the Hamas and consider the Israeli military operation in Gaza a genocide”. Meanwhile, several artists have resigned from their posts at the renowned German modern art exhibition, Documenta, in a showdown that has dominated Europe’s cultural headlines for weeks. On November 16, most of the exhibition’ssix-member finding committee quitin solidarity with Ranjit Hoskote, who had quit days earlier after a German daily, Suddeutsche Zeitung, revealed that he had signed a 2019 letter published by the Indian arm of theBoycott, Divestment, Sanctions(BDS) movement. That letter prompted German accusations of anti-Semitism against Hoskote, a writer and curator. Earlier, the managing director of Documenta, Andreas Hoffmann, publicly condemned two Indonesian artistic directors of the last Documenta in 2022 for allegedly liking, and then unliking, an Instagram post in support of Palestine. The pro-Palestinian post had been published by British artist and activist Hamja Ahsan, who took part in Documenta’s 2022 edition as a solo artist. Ahsan’s Instagram account username, realdocumenta, was later suspended. He alleged that Hoffmann had complained to the social media platform citing a trademark violation. Ahsan told Al Jazeera he believes Hoffman’s complaint was a pretext to censor his pro-Palestinian content, as he described the episode as “extremely distressing”. Hoffmann said that Ahsan’s username “infringed the trademark ‘Documenta’ … Based on its terms of use, Instagram came to the conclusion that the account had to be blocked.” Cultural sectors from the United Kingdom to the Netherlands have been impacted, too. Earlier this month, several filmmakers withdrew from the world’s leading documentary festival, held in the Netherlands, after organisers criticised a pro-Palestinian protest on opening night during which activists raised a banner on stage reading “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”. The artistic director of the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), Orwa Nyrabia, initially applauded the protest, but later condemned the slogan. Palestinian filmmaker Basma Alsharif, who was among those to abandon the festival, accused Nyrabia of peddling misinformation. “This kind of propaganda against Palestinians of being anti-Semitic is the thing that has been used widely against us for a long time,” Alsharif told Al Jazeera of the “river to the sea” slogan, which is deemed a rallying cry by pro-Palestinian protestors, but a call to destroy Israel by supporters of the Jewish state. “There have been decades of fighting to get that [misinterpretation] cleared up and clarified but it’s very clear that it’s not working, because [accusations like this] are being used very aggressively against us right now.” Nathan Thrall, an acclaimed American author based in Jerusalem, was looking forward to the London launch of his book, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: A Palestine Story, on October 12, but the event was abruptly cancelled by police on security grounds. The Palestine Festival of Literature, which was set to host him, announced the measure, which London’s Met Police force did not deny; “We do not comment on security advice given to individuals,” they told Al Jazeera. Thrall’s work of narrative non-fiction details the challenges faced by Palestinians under Israeli occupation. He told Al Jazeera that his London appearance had been the “biggest event of my book tour”. “This was a time whenthe atmosphere in the UKwas very [politically] hostile to expressions of sympathy for Palestinians,” said Thrall. The writer, whose US book events were also cancelled, added, “Obviously, I wouldn’t want to hold an event if there really was an issue of safety” but questioned whether “events centred around a pro-Israel book would have had the same safety concerns”. After almost two months of cancellations and condemnation, pro-Palestinian creatives in Europe see an uncertain future. “Being an artist is already so precarious,” said Alsharif. “So how is it possible that someone’s personal political view on something in the cultural sector [can be] punished? “That’s a very dangerous precedent. And if you don’t stand up then it means that anything [you say or do] can be scrutinised if it doesn’t fall under an agenda.”",Published On 30 Nov 2023

"Three killed, sev­er­al in­jured in shoot­ing at Jerusalem bus stop",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/three-killed-several-injured-in-shooting-at-jerusalem-bus-stop,"Two gunmen were also killed by police shortly after opening fire on the crowd. Three people have been killed and several wounded after two gunmen opened fire at a bus stop on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Israeli police said. The attackers were also killed. Police said 16 people were injured in Thursday morning’s shooting. Emergency services evacuated eight of the more seriously wounded victims to nearby hospitals, the Israeli ambulance service said. Police in West Jerusalem said the gunmen “arrived at the scene in a vehicle armed with firearms”, including an M16 and a pistol, and opened fire towards a crowd of civilians at the bus station. The attackers were “subsequently neutralised by security forces and a nearby civilian”, police said. Ammunition and weapons were found inside their car, they added. Israeli media reported that the two attackers were brothers from occupied East Jerusalem, Murad Nimr, 38, and Ibrahim Nimr, 30. Hours after the attack, Hamas claimed the brothers as its members, saying in a statement that “the operation came as a natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the occupation”, referring to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the treatment of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The statement also called for “an escalation of the resistance”. Security camera footage aired by Israel’s Channel 12 television on Thursday showed the moments of the attack. A white car is seen stopped beside a crowded bus stop. Two men then step out, guns drawn, and run at the crowd as people scatter. Shortly afterwards the attackers are gunned down. The Magen David Adom emergency service said one of the Israeli victims was a 24-year-old woman. A 73-year-old man, who was in a critical condition, was pronounced dead at Shaare Zedek Medical Center. A third person also died of his wounds, Israeli media reported. The ambulance service initially said that five of the wounded had serious injuries and two had moderate to light injuries. The incident took place just as Israel and Hamas agreed toextend the trucefor a seventh day, shortly before the agreement was set to expire. After the attack, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that Israeli soldiers raided the neighbourhood of Sur Baher in East Jerusalem where the attackers lived, broke into their house, and detained some of their family members for questioning. On Thursday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government will continue to distribute weapons to Israeli civilians. “The government headed by me will continue expanding the distribution of weapons to citizens. This is a measure that proves itself time and time again in the war against murderous terrorism,” he said on X. Meanwhile, Energy Minister Israel Katz demanded that the attackers’ family members lose their East Jerusalemidentity cards, saying they must also be denied any other “allowances and privileges”. “We must hit the supporters of terrorism everywhere,” he said on X.

Pho­tos: Peo­ple around the world ral­ly in sol­i­dar­i­ty with Pales­tini­ans,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/30/photos-people-around-the-world-rally-in-solidarity-with-palestinians,"In Pictures Demonstrators around the world have rallied to mark the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People condemning Israel’s war on Gaza and calling for a permanent ceasefire. Protests were held on Wednesday in Manila, Tunis, Tehran, Karachi, Beirut, Harare, Tokyo, Stockholm, London, Johannesburg, Quezon City, Milan and elsewhere. The International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People is observed on November 29 each year to mark the anniversary of Resolution 181, when the UN General Assembly on this day in 1947 adopted a resolution to partition Palestine into two states. Israel launched a massive military campaign in the Gaza Strip after Palestinian group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. The aerial and ground offensive on the tiny coastal enclave has since killed some 15,000 people, including 6,150 children and 4,000 women, according to Palestinian health authorities. On Thursday, mediator Qatar said Israel and Hamas had agreed to extend a fragile truce that started on November 24 for another day.",Published On 30 Nov 2023
‘Pales­tine will win’: Sri Lan­ka busi­ness­es raise funds for war-rav­aged Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/palestine-will-win-sri-lanka-businesses-raise-funds-for-war-ravaged-gaza,"A fundraiser in Colombo aimed for 10 percent of the proceeds to go for Gaza. Most vendors donated their whole income. Colombo, Sri Lanka– On most days, the Dolci Falasteen restaurant in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo is quiet. Located on a main road in a busy neighbourhood, the eatery is an escape from the busy mood of the city. Traditional Arabic lanterns cast a warm glow over its cosy dining area. But on a Sunday afternoon, seven weeks after Israel launched its ruthless assault on Gaza, the restaurant that specialises inPalestinian cuisineis bustling with young entrepreneurs. They have united for a common cause: to raise funds for Palestine. Aisha Altaf, a 24-year-old entrepreneur who runs a cosmetics business, is behind the fundraiser. The LURE Foundation, which she established recently, had offered other businesses a chance to put up stalls at the fundraiser and donate at least 10 percent of their proceeds to Gaza. Most vendors donated their whole income. “After constantly seeing graphic content of what’s happening to the people in Gaza, I felt immense guilt for having the most basic things like sleeping on a bed, having water, and hot meals,” Altaf told Al Jazeera. “This is most definitely a genocide, and whoever cannot see it is simply choosing to ignore all the facts.”  This is a modal window.

This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  LURE Foundation has partnered with the Africa Muslims Agency, a humanitarian organisation set up in 1987, that will use the money to supply aid to Gaza. So far, they have received more than 2.1 million Sri Lankan rupees ($6,400) in donations and from the fundraiser. “We plan to provide hot meals for the helpless victims. As winter is approaching, we are also providing winter jackets for children, especially those that are displaced and sleeping on the street,” Altaf said. At the event, 14-year-old Mumina Hilmy, clad in a black cloak with red and green stripes, is running her own stall with her mother’s help. She is selling bracelets and key tags that she crocheted with the colours of the Palestinian flag. “I made these during my free time and recess at school,” Hilmy told Al Jazeera. Miquelaa Fernando, 25, who bought a bracelet, said she is happy to support a bigger cause. “We feel helpless when so many bigger organisations and governments haven’t done anything to help other than the ceasefire [in Gaza]. By coming here, I felt this is something I could do to show some form of support,” she said. For entrepreneurs and visitors, the fundraiser — cosmetics, food, perfumes, toys and stationery were on sale — was a symbol of solidarity with Palestine. Sajida Shabir, a 26-year-old restaurateur, sold home-made food like chicken rolls, cookies, chilli paste and mayonnaise under her brand Hungryislander’s Kitchen. Her mother and sister were there to support her. “I’ve donated through other platforms earlier. But rather than just donating money, I’m putting in my effort here through sales. So it makes me feel good about it,” she said. Umar Farook, 56, who visited the stalls, said he would support Palestine whenever he could. “Palestinians have the right to live in their own country. The international community must make sure that happens. Palestine will win,” he said. When Sri Lanka was under British rule, the then-Chief Justice Sir Alexander Johnston had proposed to establish a Jewish settlement in the island, then known as Ceylon. But the proposal was not successful, according to a paper published by the Begin-Sadat Centre for Strategic Studies, an Israeli think tank, in 2021. Since gaining independence in 1948, Sri Lanka established relations with both Israel and Palestine and has called for a two-state solution. For three decades, Sri Lanka, a predominantly Buddhist nation, was at war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a group that fought for aseparate state for Tamilsin the northern and eastern parts of the country. Uditha Devapriya, an international relations analyst, said Sinhalese nationalist groups who believe Sri Lanka is the chosen land for Buddhists have been sympathetic with the similar notions that Zionism has held with regards to Israel as the promised land for Jews. But these groups, which have opposed international calls to probe alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka, see double standards in Western powers allowing Israel to get away with the mass killings in Gaza. “Now Sinhala nationalists are using the Gaza Strip tragedy to show the hypocrisy of the Western powers,” Devapriya, chief analyst of international relations at Colombo-based think tank Factum, told Al Jazeera. “It’s a perfect opportunity for them to reflect on how the West treated Sri Lanka during the war while showing favourable treatment to Israel.” For several years, countries such as the United States that staunchly support Israel have backed United Nations resolutions calling for probes into alleged war crimes committed during Sri Lanka’s war. Earlier this month, President Ranil Wickremesinghe accused the West of double standards. “What applies to us must also apply in Gaza,” he had said. Meanwhile, many Sri Lankan Tamils see parallels between Israel’s deadly assault on Gaza — in which nearly 15,000 people have been killed — and the final stages of the civil war during which the Sri Lankan government allegedly committed war crimes. The government denies the claims. “The aggression on Gaza should be seen as similar to the killing of Tamils at Mullivaikal [where the final battle of the war occurred],” Sri Prakas, joint secretary for the Mass Movement for Social Justice said in a statement. Dozens of demonstrations have taken place in Sri Lanka opposing Israel’s Gaza assault, which followed an attack by Hamas fighters on southern Israel on October 7, in which 1,200 people were killed. At protests across Sri Lanka, people have marched with placards saying “Stop the Genocide” and “End Israeli Apartheid”. A continuingtrucehas seen dozens of Palestinian prisoners and Israeli captives released over the past six days, as Palestinians in Gaza return to their bombed homes and devastated cities.  In the northern city of Jaffna, once a focal point of Sri Lanka’s civil war, a group of Tamils held a protest calling for an end to the attacks. Pro-Palestinian protesters were also there in their hundreds at a demonstration in Colombo, attended by leaders of the Buddhist, Christian, Muslim and Hindu faiths. Father Lionel Peiris, who was part of a fact-finding mission sent by the World Council of Churches to Palestine during the first Intifada in the late 1980s, also protested. “When people are being slaughtered, and when their land and houses are being taken, look at it as humans. Feel sadness. Feel sorrow and anger. You can’t let that happen,” Peiris told Al Jazeera. “[Benjamin] Netanyahu’s government has completely dehumanised Palestinians. This can’t go on.” Tassy Dahlan, an educational consultant, attended at least five protests in support of Palestine, including ones opposite the US embassy and the UN Compound in Colombo. “There are Muslim, Christian and Jewish children who have been killed. Their lives have been snapped away because of the political agendas of some countries who are turning a blind eye to humanity,” Dahlan told Al Jazeera. People have laid flowers, lit candles, tied ribbons and posted notes of solidarity at a memorial at the Palestine embassy in Colombo. Meanwhile, Melani Gunathilaka, a civil rights activist, has been battling disinformation about the conflict on social media. “Groups with money and power dictate the narratives. That’s why I try to share verified information, and read the research done on these topics by experts, to set the record straight,” Gunathilaka told Al Jazeera. Back at the Dolci Falasteen restaurant, as the fundraiser drew to a close, Altaf admitted feeling a “little less helpless” – but then also expressed hope. “Let us embrace unity, collaboration and empathy. Together, we have the power to build a better future for all. Every action we take has a ripple effect, impacting lives beyond our own borders,” she said.  This is a modal window.

Pho­tos: Hamas and Is­rael free more cap­tives,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/30/hamas-and-israel-free-more-detainees-in-sixth-captive-exchange,"In Pictures Ten Israeli women and children and four Thai nationals held captive in Gaza were freed by Hamas on Wednesday, after which Israel released another 30 Palestinian women and childprisoners. It was the sixth and latest exchange of captives under a temporary ceasefire agreement in the Gaza war. Two Russian-Israeli women were also freed by Hamas in an earlier release. The Palestinians released from Israeli jails included 16 minors and 14 women. Over the years, Israel has imprisoned thousands of Palestinians, many held in administrative detention without charge. Among the freed Palestinians was prominent activist Ahed Tamimi. The 22-year-old Palestinian icon wasarrestedduring Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank on November 6. On Friday, Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day temporary truce and captive exchange. This was extended for two days late on Monday and extended for a second time early on Thursday morning. Since Friday, at least 74 captives from Israel and 210 Palestinians have been released. Further prisoner exchanges are expected to take place. On October 7, Israel launched a massive military campaign in the Gaza Strip following a cross-border attack by Hamas which killed 1,200 people. Israeli attacks have since killed at least 15,000 Palestinians, including 6,150 children and 4,000 women, in Gaza.",Published On 30 Nov 2023
Is­rael and Hamas agree to ex­tend truce for sev­enth day,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/israel-and-hamas-agree-to-extend-truce-for-seventh-day,"The temporary pause in fighting will continue for another 24 hours. The truce between Israel and Hamas has been extended for a seventh day, sources from both sides announced just minutes before the agreement was set to expire. Israel’s military said on Thursday that the temporary pause in fighting in the Gaza Strip will continue “in light of the mediators’ efforts to continue the process of releasing hostages, and subject to the terms of the agreement”. In a separate statement, Hamas said an agreement has been reached to extend the temporary ceasefire, which initially began on Friday. The truce will be extended for at least another 24 hours. Qatar, which has been mediating between the two sides, said the agreement was being extended under the same terms as in the past, under which Hamas has released 10 Israeli hostages per day in exchange for 30 Palestinian prisoners. Until the last hour, the prospect of an extension was in question, after the two sides failed to agree on the new list of Israeli captives to be released from Gaza on Thursday. Hamas said Israel rejected a proposed list that included seven living captives and the remains of three captives the group said were killed in previous Israeli air strikes. Israel later said Hamas submitted an improved list, paving the way for the extension. The talks between the two sides appear to be growing tougher as most of the women and children held by Hamas are freed. The Palestinian group may seek greater numbers of prisoner releases in return for freeing Israeli men and soldiers. “There are only so many civilian hostages left,” Mohamed Elmasry, an analyst with the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera. “The longer this extends, the more difficult this will be for Hamas to produce civilian hostages because they have a very limited number of them.” He said Hamas would likely demand far greater concessions, such as a permanent ceasefire and the release of allPalestinian prisoners, to release Israeli soldiers. “Israel is going to want those hostages back. The question is: at what price?” Elmasry said. News of Thursday’s extension came as a relief in Gaza, where citizens were left in the dark about the truce’s status until early on Thursday morning, said Al Jazeera’s Tarek Abu Azzoum, reporting from the enclave. He said the pause in the fighting means “more humanitarian aid will be allowed to enter the Gaza Strip, including water, food, medicine and even fuel”. “Every new single day of extension [of the truce] will give Palestinians a new opportunity to be alive and to have more supplies to help them alleviate the humanitarian crisis,” he said. International pressure for such a lasting ceasefire has mounted after nearly eight weeks of Israeli bombardment and a ground campaign in Gaza. The Israeli attacks have killed at least 15,000 Palestinians, uprooted three-quarters of the population of 2.3 million and sparked a devastating humanitarian crisis. Israel has welcomed the release of dozens of hostages in recent days, including 16 late on Wednesday, and previously said it would maintain the truce for as long as Hamas kept freeing captives. Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted on Wednesday that Israel will eventually resume its attacks on Gaza as it seeks to root out Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for 16 years. “After this phase of returning our abductees is exhausted, will Israel return to fighting? So my answer is an unequivocal yes,” he said. “There is no way we are not going back to fighting until the end.”  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Pro­gres­sive US law­mak­ers re­new calls for cease­fire in Is­rael’s war on Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/progressive-us-lawmakers-renew-calls-for-ceasefire-in-israel-hamas-war,"With pause in Gaza war set to expire, Congress members gathered outside White House in call to stop the bloodshed. Washington, DC –Advocates calling for a ceasefire in Gaza were often interrupted by their own tears as they gathered outside the White House and read the names of Palestinians killedin the war. Several speakers, including CongresswomanRashida Tlaiband actors Cynthia Nixon and Denee Benton, took turns reading from a long list of names on Wednesday evening. But they barely got through a fraction of the more than 15,000 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks. Activists warned that the list of the dead would only grow if the current truce is allowed to expire and a permanent ceasefire is not secured. The vigil – attended by Tlaib and other progressive Congress members – was organised by activists, state lawmakers and artists, who arehunger strikingin Washington, DC, in support of a ceasefire in Gaza. Tlaib and her colleagues gathered to show support for the hunger strikers and warned that the war in Gaza must end, stressing that a temporary pause in fighting was not sufficient. “How many more lives will be enough? How many more children need to be killed? How many more families have to be traumatised and torn apart? There is nothing humanitarian, my friends, about giving innocent civilians a few days of rest before they are bombed again,” Tlaib said. She called on President Joe Biden to listen to people calling for a ceasefire, which is backed by most Americans and an overwhelming majority of Democrats, according to public opinion polls. Tlaib, who is the only Palestinian American member of Congress, hit out at the White House for calling lawmakers who demanded a ceasefire early in the war “repugnant”. “The bombing of innocent civilians and children is repugnant and disgraceful. The refusal to support a ceasefire and an end to violence and the killing is repugnant and disgraceful. Our president calling on Congress to fund more bombs that are being dropped on innocent civilians is repugnant and disgraceful,” Tlaib said. Biden is seeking more than $14bnin additional fundingfor Israel to support the war on Gaza, on top of the $3.8bn that Israel receives from the US annually. Tlaib underscored that leading human rights groups andPope Francishave called for a ceasefire, stressing that the demand is not controversial. Congresswoman Cori Bush, whointroduced a resolutionin the House of Representatives last month demanding a ceasefire, echoed Tlaib’s remarks, highlighting that the campaign to demand a ceasefire is making progress. “Our movement is working. They feel our energy in the White House. They hear our demands. They see us marching in the streets. They are watching the polls,” Bush said. The congresswoman noted that when she first introduced a resolution on October 16, the measure had just 13 cosponsors. Now more than 40 lawmakers in the House and the Senate have called for a ceasefire in Gaza. “It’s clear that our constituents and people all around the world want a ceasefire,” Bush said. Biden sparked speculations on Tuesday with a social media post that could be interpreted as a call for Israel to wind down the war, suggesting that the violence would only boost support for Hamas. “Hamas unleashed a terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace,” Biden wrote. “To continue down the path of terror, violence, killing, and war is to give Hamas what they seek.” But White House national security spokespersonJohn Kirbywas quick to reemphasise US support for Israel’s war effort later that day, suggesting that the country has a “responsibility” to eliminate Hamas.

The war on Gaza began on October 7 after Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 Israelis and saw more than 200 people taken as captives. The Palestinian group said the assault was in response to Israel’s illegalsettlement expansionin the occupied West Bank, mistreatment of Palestinian prisoners and incursions at Al-Aqsa mosque. Israel responded with a relentless bombing campaign that has turned into one of the deadliest conflicts for children in modern history. It also launched a ground invasion into parts of the besieged Gaza Strip andseverely restrictedthe entry of food, water, fuel and medicine into the Palestinian territory. The warhas displacedmore than one million Palestinians inside Gaza. The nearly unprecedented scale of the violence has promptedUnited Nations expertsto warn that Palestinians are at a “grave risk of genocide”. The Biden administration voiced unwavering support for Israel early on, backing its objective of destroying Hamas. But after seven weeks of fighting in Gaza, Israel seems to remain far from achieving that goal. Last week, an agreement, brokered by Qatar, the US and Egypt,was reachedto temporarily halt the fighting to allow for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the ramping up of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The trucewas extendedfor two days, but it is set to expire early on Thursday. Outside the White House on Wednesday, Congressman Jamaal Bowman said calling for a ceasefire was about reaching for our shared humanity. “We’ve all read about genocides. We have all read about mass murders. I cannot believe I’m living through one. And I cannot believe I’m living through one, and the US government is condoning it, and being complicit. Shame,” he said. For his part, Congressman Jonathan Jackson said “too many” innocent people are suffering in the war. “We have seen too much bloodshed, and we stand here with a sense of moral outrage with our courage and our conviction,” Jackson said.",Published On 30 Nov 2023

In the wake of the Hamas attack, the Frankfurt Book Fair “indefinitely postponed” an appearance by Palestinian author Adania Shibli, who was due to receive a prize for her novel Minor Detail on October 20. On November 13, Haitian-born curator Anais Duplan was left “speechless” after his Afrofuturism exhibition at Germany’s Museum Folkwang was abruptly cancelled by the museum’s director Peter Gorschluter. Gorschluter said Duplan’s social media posts “do not acknowledge the terroristic attack of the Hamas and consider the Israeli military operation in Gaza a genocide”.

The Israeli forces usually raid Beitunia [near Israel’s Ofer Prison] ahead of the release of prisoners to kind of preventscenes of celebrationthat we’ve been seeing across the past week here in Ramallah as people gather from all across the occupied West Bank to take their sons home. Israeli forces have stormed the town of Sur Baher in occupied East Jerusalem, according to images verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad team. Al Jazeera Arabic also posted a video clip on X showing a separate Israeli raid in the town of Aqraba, located southeast of Nablus in the occupied West Bank. We will bring you more on the raids as soon as we get more information. As we’ve reported, 30 Palestinian prisoners are being released tonight in the seventh exchange of the Israel-Hamas truce. Relatives and friends are gathering in Ramallah to welcome them home. We’ll bring you more shortly. Humanitarian groups, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, should look into the “horrible” treatment of Palestinians being held in Israeli prisons, a mother of one of the Palestinian prisoners said. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Maysa Ayyash, mother of 18-year-old Mohammad, one of the detainees expected to be released by Israel, said that her son has been deprived of his basic necessities, including food and clothing, while in detention. Mohammad, has been in administrative detention (held without charge) for the last five months, and his detention would have been extended if no deal had been reached between Israel and Hamas, Ayyash said. “They took him in the middle of the night while we were sleeping. For 10 days, the Israeli authorities subjected him to interrogation and solitary confinement, and we didn’t know where he was those 10 days,” she recalled. “I was running after him barefoot as he was taken away by Israeli forces. Now I am very joyful for the release of my son. But this also comes at the cost of the destruction of Gaza and its people. So I can’t really describe my feelings, if I should feel sad or happy.” Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem The Israelis have not made any formal announcement or confirmation about another extension of the [truce]. The Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, at his nightly press conference said that if the deal continues as planned, they are looking to release more captives tomorrow, which would indicate another day of pause in the fighting. But for all these extensions we have seen, the Israelis have not made any formal announcement themselves. It was rather made through mediators and the Qataris who announced it on their behalf. However, early Thursday morning, about 40 minutes before the [truce] was about to expire, the Israeli army released a statement saying there would be an additional day of the [truce] – which is today – as mediators were continuing their efforts to release the captives. So, while all signs could be pointing towards an extension, there is still no confirmation at this time – at least not from the Israelis.   ",Published On 30 Nov 2023
Analy­sis: Why ex­tend­ing the Is­rael-Hamas truce won’t be easy,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/analysis-why-extending-the-israel-hamas-truce-wont-be-easy,"Mediators are locked in hectic parleys to extend the pause in fighting, but it’s becoming harder for Israel to agree to. With hours left of theagreed pausein Gaza fighting, Israel, Hamas and the intermediaries negotiating between them were on Wednesday again in a frenzy of activity. The original truce was to have lasted until Monday, but Hamas decided to accept the Israeli offer to extend the ceasefire by a day for each group of 10 captives released. As the original deadline loomed an extension was proclaimed, but of just two days. Two is still better than nothing, and the two extra days bought the Qatari and Egyptian mediators extra time to work out how to convince both sides to prolong the truce even further or turn it into a permanent ceasefire. It has not been easy. Whilenegotiations through intermediarieshave been difficult, long and often tedious, they did finally produce some results and an agreement in principle that led to the initial four-day truce and indirectly to the two-day extension. During initial negotiations, Israel unilaterally declared that the pause could be made longer by the release of additional captives, so not much had to be additionally negotiated. Yet, as more time passed, talks through Qatari and Egyptian intermediaries seemed to be dragging, and lists of detainees to be released kept being agreed upon and accepted later and later each day; at one point Hamas even threatened to stop the process and let the truce collapse. Now, on Wednesday evening, the situation appears to be more complicated than ever. Hamas announced that it is seeking a further four-day extension, and even hinted at being ready to negotiate the release of all captives it is holding, in exchange for a more lasting cessation of hostilities. At the same time, Israel said it welcomes the possible release of additional captives, but sent mixed messages about the continuation of the pause. In such an atmosphere of uncertainty mixed with anxiety and hope, international mediators are trying harder than ever. For the past two days, they have been joined in Qatar by the highest officials from the US, Israeli and Egyptian intelligence services. No announcement has been made of the presence of their Hamas counterparts, but it is very hard to imagine that the Palestinian side would not be represented in such an intelligence summit. One would expect that, with the experience oftwo rounds of negotiations, it would be easier to reach agreements on the continuation and expansion of the deals. Yet, there are many signs to suggest that the situation is getting more complicated with talks possibly getting bogged down. How is it possible that from overwhelming optimism that marked the weekend mass celebrations of former captives rejoining their communities, the talks are now on the verge of failure with the real prospect of fighting resuming on Thursday? There are several reasons for the apparent reluctance of both Israel and Hamas to prolong the truce by exchanging more captives. First, tactical and strategic military reasons, mostly on the Israeli side. Over the past few days, several representatives of the Israeli military indicated that they would prefer the current two-day extension of the pause to be the last. Generals told the political leadership that the military believes that fighting should be resumed on Thursday morning. From the very beginning of the armed intervention, the Israeli army was wary of having to go to war without clearly defined strategic goals. I warned that soldiers detest “open-ended” tasks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated several times that his goal was to win the war by destroying Hamas, but he obviously never translated that into clear and measurable orders and tasks. Generals prefer to be told: “Go there and do that, if and when you achieve it your job is done”. Their eagerness to resume fighting is by no means an indication that they are bloodthirsty; on the contrary, it tells those who want to listen that they are realists. Following the 7 October attacks, the Israeli military mobilised 360,000 reservists, deploying them alongside the standing army of 150,000 soldiers. While the fighting went on, each reservist and each unit, whether in Gaza or along the northern front facingHezbollah, knew exactly what his or her task and purpose was. They were focused, in a military mindset, not overtly influenced by the atmosphere among civilians. But as they stopped for four days, then for two more, many went home for short rest and were exposed to the doubts, uncertainties, fears and hopes of their families and relatives. For a couple of days, they lived almost as civilians, but, as the original pause was to expire on Monday, they would have had to return to units by Sunday afternoon – the time when the extension was announced. Military bureaucracy then had to decide whether to give them an extra day or two at home or rotate soldiers, with the eventual new group being granted just two days off and so on. Another extension would further complicate the logistics of leave and rotation, but prolonged semi-civilian life could also damage the determination to fight. After October 7, Israeli national adrenaline ran high and everyone was ready to fight. Now, seeing that the country’s politics is a mess; the leadership is in poorly hidden disarray and the prime minister is clearly troubled, shaken and insincere, soldiers may start to vacillate. Aware of potential problems with morale and determination, generals obviously prefer to get the fighting over with, rather than endure more of the stop-go-stop-go orders that in all wars prove detrimental to the fighting capabilities of an army.",Published On 29 Nov 2023

The United States Department of the Treasury has announced new sanctions targeting 21 Iranians, foreign nationals, and firms accused of involvement in an illicit financial network for the benefit of the Iranian military. In a statement on Wednesday, the department said that Iran relies on an array of “foreign-based front companies and brokers” to fund regional armed groups such as the Palestinian groupHamasand the Lebanon-based groupHezbollah. “Iran generates the equivalent of billions of dollars via commodity sales to fund its destabilizing regional activities and support of multiple regional proxy groups, including Hamas” and Hezbollah, the statement said. Iran engages in “illicit finance schemes to generate funds to fan conflict and spread terror throughout the region,” said Brian Nelson, Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. “The United States remains committed to exposing elements of the Iranian military and its complicit partners abroad to disrupt this critical source of funds,” he added. The US has issued sanctions targetingIran-backed groupsacross the region since Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel on October 7, sparking fears of a wider conflict that could draw in Washington and Iran’s formidable network of proxies.

"Hurt, scared but free now. Pales­tin­ian boy re­calls abuse in Is­raeli prison",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/29/beaten-humiliated-palestinian-boy-recalls-israeli-detention-abuse,"Mohammad Salhab Tamimi, 18, was returned to his family on Tuesday as part of an ongoing prisoner exchange deal. Hebron, occupied West Bank –After eight months in Israeli prisons without being charged or processed, 18-year-old Mohammad Salhab Tamimi was finally able to return to his family as part of an ongoing prisoner exchange deal. His boyish face was serious as he embraced his parents and stood, slightly bewildered, as if he was unsure whether to speak to the press or not. He had been through a lot in the past eight months of uncertainty, torment that only increased since the start of the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on October 7. The last thing he was told by the forbidding Israeli prison guards was that he would be rearrested and put back into the limbo of administrative detention if his family and friends showed any signs of celebrating his return. “’Tell your friends [they said]’… If we have a big celebration, I will return to prison,” he recalled. Wary of the Israeli military checkpoint and illegal settlement next to their home, his family kept their happiness on mute, with only the immediate family and some uncles present. Luckily for the family, smiles don’t make any noise, and nobody could stop the smiles on his mother Fatima and father Murshid’s faces as they held tightly to their “little boy”. Their boy was among the fourth batch of Palestinian prisoners to be released from Ofer prison near Ramallah in the small hours of Tuesday overnight. Up to the last minute, he had not been sure what was happening to him. At 7am (05:00 GMT) on Monday, November 27, a guard at Rimon Prison demanded that Mohammad get ready to be transferred to Ofer Prison. That was all; nothing about the reason why he was being moved. Just told to strip off completely, put on just a grey prison sweatsuit, and gather all his belongings. “I put my clothes in one of those plastic envelopes and walked to the cell door where they cuffed my hands and forced my head down so I was looking at the ground. “The officer then kicked me, hard. His boots have steel in them, so it felt like he crushed my feet, it really hurt. “He dragged me to the prison yard but, as he was dragging me out of the prison, he stopped to take my clothes from me and threw them into a garbage pail. Then, cursing me with obscene language, he dragged me out,” Mohammad recalled haltingly. Mohammad was loaded into a prisoner transfer vehicle known as a “bosta” – avan with blacked-out windows and tight cellswith metal seats, to which prisoners are chained. Bosta rides can take 12 hours or more. There are no rest stops, food, or toilet breaks. “I was kept in the vehicle cell without anything to eat or drink until after midnight,” said Mohammad. His father and uncle were standing there outside Ofer, waiting for him, when he was finally released in the wee hours on Tuesday so they could drive him home to Hebron in the south of the occupied West Bank. Things were more unpleasant than usual in prison after October 7, which was when Hamas launched a surprise attack from Gaza on southern Israel killing some 1,200 people. People held in several institutions have reported severe beatings, denial of medical attention, lawyer and family visits, yard time, electricity, water, and hygiene essentials from the prison shop. At least six Palestinian prisoners died or were killed in Israeli custody since October 7, including some shortly after their arrest. Israel’s relentless bombing of the Gaza Strip after the Hamas attack lasted 48 days and killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,000 children. On the 49th day, Friday, a four-day “humanitarian pause” negotiated by Egypt and Qatar began. Both sides said they would release captives – Hamas would release batches of people it took captive on October 7 in return for three times as many Palestinians held – with and without cause – in Israeli detention facilities. As the exchanges continued and optimism rose, the truce was extended by two days to keep the exchanges going. Over the same days that it released some 150 Palestinian detainees,Israel arrested 133 people, nearly as many, from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to Palestinian prisoner associations. Since October 7, Israel carried out 3,290 arrests in the same areas, which it has occupied since 1967. Mohammad is not the first released person to say that there is extreme overcrowding in Israeli prisons. “There were 10 prisoners shoved into cells that only had six beds. We used to have to spread blankets or something on the floor to sleep,” he said. The amount of food they were given was insufficient, as it was also for six prisoners, not 10. The cellmates had to ration what food they got carefully. Several prisoners were injured one day as well, Mohammad said, when prison guards attacked two sections of Rimon Prison Aside from injuries and the reported deaths, Mohammad said: “The [Israeli] occupation had pretty much decided that they would humiliate the prisoners, ever since the outbreak of Al-Aqsa Storm.” Cut off from any news of the outside world, the detainees found themselves stripped of almost everything, including all possessions that were in their cells like utensils and appliances, they used to make things a little more pleasant. They were deprived of buying hygiene supplies, including laundry detergent, and barred from using the washing machines to wash their clothes. Prison authorities also kept the prisoners away from their only outlet to let off some steam – the “fora”, or prison yard, and prevented them from making any noise. “I used to love making the call to prayer from inside my cell so the whole section could hear, but that too was forbidden. “It felt like they didn’t want us to even breathe.”",Published On 29 Nov 2023

Israeli women and children on their return from captivity in Gaza have spoken of being beaten and threatened, moved from place to place and forced to whisper during weeks spent with little to do, their families say. Most captives released during a six-day-old truce have been rushed to hospitals in a country still reeling from the shock of their abduction during a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Israel says 1,200 people were killed. Since thelatest round of releases began on Friday, with Israel releasing some jailed Palestinians in exchange, the freed captives have been kept away from the media. Their stories have come out through the filter of family members, without independent verification, offering a hint of their ordeal.

Deborah Cohen told France’s BFM TV she had been told her 12-year-old nephew Eitan Yahalomi and others were beaten by Palestinian residents on arrival in Gaza during the Hamas attack. She said his captors made him watch footage of the Hamas violence. “Every time a child cried there, they threatened them with a weapon to make them be quiet. Once they got to Gaza, all the civilians, everyone was hitting them … We’re talking about a child, 12 years old,” she said. Hamas, the Palestinian armed group which governs Gaza, says it has treated the captives in accordance with Islamic teachings to preserve their lives and wellbeing. It says some captives were killed by Israeli air raids during a military offensive that was launched in response to the October 7 attacks. More than 15,000 people have been killed in the Israeli air and ground assault, including more than 6,000 children, according to Palestinian officials in Gaza. Some details are slowly surfacing from medical professionals treating them and relatives of the freed captives. Ronit Zaidenstein, head of the medical team at Shamir Medical Center where 17 released Thai nationals were treated, said they had been fed “very unnutritious food” in captivity. “The people who came to us lost a significant amount of their body weight in such a short time – 10 percent or more.” In an interview that has since been taken offline, Margarita Mashavi, a doctor at Wolfson Medical Centre – one of the main facilities caring for freed captives – said those she spoke to described being kept several stories underground. “They didn’t give them light. They gave it to them for only two hours,” she was quoted as saying by the Ynet news site on Monday. The families of two girls who were held together found it hard to hear their children on their return home because they spoke only in whispers. “I had to put my ear close to her mouth to hear. In captivity, she was told not to make any noise. You can see the terror in her eyes,” Thomas Hand, the father of nine-year-old Emily Hand, told CNN. Yair Rotem said his niece Hila Rotem Shoshani, 13, was held with Emily Hand, and was also now speaking in whispers. She spoke of hugging her mother Raaya, still in Gaza, who cried when the girls were taken from her before their return to Israel. Merav Mor Raviv said captors of her cousin Keren Munder, Keren’s nine-year-old son Ohad and mother Ruth, spoke Hebrew and at times, would motion with a finger across their throats as if to warn of death if they did not do as told. She told Israel’s Channel 12 they were moved from place to place, both underground and above ground. They lost weight as food was scarce at times, and ate mostly rice and bread. Adva Adar said her grandmother Yaffa Adar, 85, had shown toughness by constantly contemplating reuniting with family. “She said that she was thinking about the family a lot and that it helped her survive and that she could hear the voices of the great-grandchildren calling her and that it gave her a lot of power,” the granddaughter told Reuters. One Israeli mother, Daniel Aloni, wrote to thank Hamas’s armed Qassam Brigades before her release with daughter Emilia. Their story went viral in Arabic media. Daniel wrote to thank them for giving Emilia sweets and fruit and treating her daughter like a queen. “I will forever be thankful that she doesn’t leave here with trauma,” she wrote. “If only in this world we could truly be good friends.” It was not clear whether Daniel was forced to write the letter in captivity.

Is­raeli forces kill two Pales­tin­ian chil­dren in oc­cu­pied West Bank raid,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/israel-kills-two-children-in-latest-raid-on-jenin-refugee-camp,"Residents of Jenin camp, which has seen nightly raids since October 7, say they were ‘shocked’ at scale of attack. Two Palestinian boys were shot and killed by Israeli forces in Jenin, in the north of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has said. As talks toextend the trucebetween Israel and Hamas continued on Wednesday before a looming deadline, the Israeli army raided theJenin refugee camp, causing widespread destruction and killing four Palestinians, including two children. Adam Samer al-Ghoul, 8, was shot in the head and Basil Suleiman Abu al-Wafa, 15, died after he was shot in the chest. The Israeli army forced residents of the ad-Damj neighbourhood to leave their homes at gunpoint and destroyed streets in the neighbourhood, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported citing security and local sources.

In a joint statement to Israeli media, the Border Police, Israeli army and Shin Bet security agency said the army had killed two people reportedly involved in armed resistance, including a key leader. They were named as Muhammad Zubeidi and Hussam Hanoun. The statement acknowledged that two more people were killed amid clashes in the area. An Israeli army spokesperson did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for further comment. According to the statement, 17 Palestinians were arrested in the raid. CCTV footage circulating online shows a boy falling on a street in the camp after being hit by a bullet. Another video appears to show the other boy being hit on the street and calling for help as more bullets are fired on the ground around him. The older boy can be seen struggling on the ground in apparent agony for at least half a minute. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Jenin, said people were “shocked” at the scale of Israel’s latest raid on the refugee camp, which has been subject to several Israeli incursions since the war began. “They’re describing it as the largest raid since October 7,” Stratford said, referring to the start of the most recent Israel-Hamas war. “We spoke to the owner of a house that was destroyed. He said that it was about 5am [03:00 GMT] this morning when Israeli soldiers surrounded the house. He then became aware of potentially at least one Palestinian fighter – possibly two – hiding in his home,” he added. “What subsequently happened is that the Palestinian fighters were killed as the house was destroyed.” The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli forces blocked its medics from reaching the camp, “despite the presence of injured persons who need help and whose life is threatened”.  Israeli army raids have taken place on a daily basis across the West Bank since the war began. According to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS) and the Prisoners’ Affairs Authority, Israeli forces arrested 35 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank within the past 24 hours, including a 12-year-old. The total number of people arrested since October 7 is now more than 3,325, the PPS said. At least 242 Palestinians, including more than 50 children, have been killed in the occupied West Bank since October 7. More than 2,750 have been injured.",Published On 29 Nov 2023
South Africans de­mand per­ma­nent Gaza cease­fire dur­ing pro-Pales­tine march,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/south-africans-demand-permanent-gaza-ceasefire-during-pro-palestine-march,"Pro-Palestine protesters marched through Johannesburg demanding a permanent ceasefire in Israel’s war on Gaza. Members of South African political parties and civil society organisations marched through the streets of Johannesburg on Wednesday demanding a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as they marked the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. Rival political parties including the ruling African National Congress and the left-wing opposition Economic Freedom Fighters were among many demonstrators who marched across the Nelson Mandela Bridge to protest against Israel’s military offensive in Gaza against Hamas. Other protests were planned around South Africa, where many including President Cyril Ramaphosa have compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the West Bank with South Africa’s past apartheid regime of racial segregation. Decades of white-minority rule ended in South Africa with elections in 1994. Veteran anti-apartheid activist Ronnie Kasrils called for the boycott and isolation of Israel over the current war. “All over the world, millions and millions are coming out and saying no, no, no. We will boycott and isolate Israel until it hurts them, and we stand by the Palestinian people fully, in our total support,” Kasrils told the crowd. For years, the country has been critical of Israel’s continued occupation of Gaza. Last week, a majority of South African lawmakersvoted in favourof a motion calling for the closure of Israel’s embassy and the suspension of diplomatic relations. The motion was sponsored by EFF lawmakers but heavily backed by the governing ANC. It was opposed by members of the centrist, white-majority, largely pro-Israel Democratic Alliance. The action is largely symbolic because it will be up to PresidentCyril Ramaphosa‘s government to implement it or not. It came after Israel recalled its ambassador to South Africa following remarks by South African leaders who accused Israel of committing genocide and referred Israel’s attacks on Gaza to the International Criminal Court.",Published On 29 Nov 2023
Jailed with­out charge: How Is­rael holds thou­sands of Pales­tin­ian pris­on­ers,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/jailed-without-charge-how-israel-holds-thousands-of-palestinian-prisoners,"Israel has called Palestinians released under a truce with Hamas violent ‘terrorists.’ But most haven’t been charged. As Palestinian prisoners were being released last week, Israel imposed a ban on celebrations by their family members. “Expressions of joy”, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said, “are equivalent to backing terrorism”. Israel has presented imprisoned Palestinians as “terrorists” and hassubjected many of the detainees to abuse. But of the 300 Palestinian women and children whom Israel has identified for potential release as part of the humanitarian pause between Israel and Hamas, nearly 80 percent were not even formally charged. An overwhelming majority of Palestinian prisoners were arrested under a quasi-judicial process known as administrative detention, under which Palestinians are initially jailed for six months. Their detentions can then be repeatedly extended for an indefinite period without charge or trial. Most Palestinians, including children, are tried in military courts and handed lengthy sentences in what critics call sham military trials because in many cases Palestinians are deprived of defence lawyers and due process. In comparison, Israeli citizens are tried in civil courts, highlighting the two-tier justice system that discriminates against Palestinians. Here’s a look at the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, how Israel has weaponised administrative detention and why many Palestinians are forced to go through Israeli military courts.  The vast majority of the Palestinians – 233 prisoners out of the 300 – on Israel’s release list have not been formally charged and were held as administrative detainees. An overwhelming majority of them are children. The youngest is 14. Almost three-quarters of them are from the occupied West Bank, which has seen asurge of arrestssince the start of Israel’s war on Gaza on October 7. The West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem had already seen a spike in Israeli raids this year even before the war. The longest serving prisoner among the 300 has been held for 102 months, or eight-and-a-half years. The most recent prisoner was arrested two months ago. Nearly half of the prisoners have no affiliation with any Palestinian political or armed group. Others are believed to be affiliated with Hamas, Fatah, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Prisoners may be held under administrative detention indefinitely. During that time, which could span years, the prisoners, their families and their lawyers may remain in the dark as to what the prisoner has been charged with and what evidence there is against them. Israel has arrested an estimated one million Palestinians since occupying East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in 1967, according to a United Nations report released last year. A considerable number of them are believed to be administrative detainees. Israel has ramped up arrests since the October 7 Hamas attacks on southern Israel, doubling the number of Palestinians in custody to more than 10,000 b efore releasing some of them. Hamas fighters killed at least 1,200 people during their attack. Israel’s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed nearly 15,000 people, most of them women and children. The Oslo Accords of the 1990s led to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA), but a semi-government run by Palestinians has not ended the Israeli military judicial system. Israel still directly controls a majority of the West Bank and has allowed construction of illegal settlements on Palestinian lands. The PA has faced criticism for itssecurity coordinationwith Israel, under which it is obliged to share information regarding armed Palestinian groups. It has a penal code and a judiciary, but the three million Palestinians in the occupied territories could easily fall under the jurisdiction of Israel’s military courts if they are accused of endangering Israeli security. That could include any activity tied to the hundreds of Palestinian organisations that Israel has deemed illegal over the decades. When charges are filed, they regularly include “terrorist” activities, which could include acts against Israeli soldiers or settlers, and “incitement”, which includes influencing public opinion. Traffic violations or being in Israel illegally for work also bring Palestinians into the military judicial system, which has a conviction rate of 99 percent. In contrast to Palestinians, Israeli settlers arrested in the West Bank are tried in civilian courts inside Israel. This practice has in effect created two legal systems, which human rights groups have calleddiscriminatory and a form of “apartheid”. Some of the Palestinian prisonerswho have been releasedas part of the truce have said they were beaten and humiliated by Israeli soldiers before being freed. Beatings grew more intense and frequent after the start of the war, but testimonies of prisoners over the decades have pointed to a longstanding pattern of beatings, torture and abuse of prisoners. Since the start of the war, rights groups have reported that the Israeli Prison Service has also considerably restricted water, food, medical care and communal items for prisoners and has restricted or altogether halted family and lawyer visits. This means that Palestinian prisoners have effectively lost some of the limited privileges that they had earned through years of campaigning and hunger strikes in prisons that are now severely overcrowded as well. Hundreds of children, some as young as nine years old, have been detained by Israeli forces in what many have said represents a violation ofthe UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Children fare no better than adults in Israeli prisons, and an array of abuses against them has been documented. The rights group Save the Children said in a report in July that 86 percent of children are beaten in Israeli detention, 69 percent are strip-searched and 42 percent are injured during their arrests. They have suffered gunshot wounds and broken bones among other injuries. Some children have reported violence of a sexual nature, and some are transferred to court or between detention centres in small cages, the London-based child rights organisation said. Palestinian children are “the only children in the world who are systematically prosecuted in military courts” and an estimated 10,000 have been held in the Israeli military detention system over the past 20 years, according to the group.",Published On 29 Nov 2023
"‘Save what re­mains of Gaza’, hos­pi­tal di­rec­tor says af­ter Is­rael bomb­ing",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/save-what-remains-of-gaza-hospital-director-says-amid-bombing,"The burden on the few remaining hospitals operating in central and southern Gaza Strip has increased. Khan Younis, Gaza Strip –Ahmed Isleem wishes he were dead. The 35-year-old’s wife and daughter were killed along with 10 other family members and neighbours in an Israeli attack on their home. He lies on a bed in the European Gaza Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, surrounded by sounds of other patients moaning and crying out in pain. Isleem was pulled out from under the rubble of his home last month. “I cannot believe that I am still alive,” he says. “Getting out from under the rubble was very difficult. I wished I had been martyred with my family instead of the suffering and pain I am experiencing now.” Isleem suffered multiple shrapnel injuries on different parts of his body including his abdomen, and underwent surgery on his digestive system and another operation to insert platinum in his foot after it was broken. “There is no safety, no treatment, nothing,” he says. “I cannot bear my pain and the screams of the other injured people around me as well.” Due to the lack of fuel and medical supplies and theIsraeli targeting of hospitals, the healthcare system in the Gaza Strip has all but collapsed. And as hospitals in northern Gaza and Gaza City have been rendered out of service, the burden on the few functional hospitals in the central and southern parts of the enclave has increased. The European Gaza Hospital receives dozens of Palestinians killed and wounded on a daily basis, some of them referrals from otheroverwhelmed hospitals. It is also a place of shelter for displaced people, despite the lack of provisions. Khawla Abu Daqqa, 40, is from the eastern Khan Younis area, near the Israeli fence which has been targeted frequently by bombings and artillery shelling. She fled with her five children to the hospital, saying she had no choice. “Where do we go? We have no shelter,” she says. “Everything is difficult here, from finding food, water and even sleep. I wish I could sleep at least five hours a day. I cannot sleep or rest. I hope this war will stop for everyone.” In a conversation with Al Jazeera, the director of the European Gaza Hospital, Dr Youssef al-Aqqad, says that displaced people – who come from all over the Gaza Strip – are having to find space wherever they can in the hospital: at the doors of patient rooms, in the corridors, on the stairs, and in the hospital garden. “These displaced people need services, including food, water and electricity,” he says. “We also feel very concerned about the Israeli army targeting hospitals. This is an abnormal and terrifying thing for patients and displaced people as well.” Al-Aqqad says dozens of wounded people arrive on a daily basis from the cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. As a result, the number of infections is on the rise and has exceeded the capacity that the hospital can handle. Al-Aqqad says a field hospital has been set up in the Ras Naqoura School, which is adjacent to the hospital’s eastern wing and where patients with moderate or minor infections are treated. “This is not an easy matter, but rather very complicated because the schools are not equipped and suitable to receive infected people and there is no medical equipment and devices there,” he says. “Furthermore, our medical staff is already stretched thin and have to follow up here and there, which had led to extreme fatigue.” The hospital has 450 wounded patients. Some of them, he says, require multiple specialist doctors — such as a neurosurgeon, a vascular doctor, an orthopaedic doctor for broken bones, and another expert for burns. The medical staff are exhausted from the non-stop work, and the volunteers who assist them have little to no experience. “We need specialised doctors to work in intensive care rooms, operations and delicate surgical specialities,” al-Aqqad says. “We have reached a difficult stage in health services, and we feel that we are giving beyond our strength and ability to save the injured and try to treat them.” At least 26 out of the 35 hospitals in the Gaza Strip are not functioning due to the lack of fuel and attacks by the Israeli army. In the northern Gaza Strip, the Indonesian Hospital has been bombed repeatedly by the Israeli army, which also ordered the evacuation of doctors and the wounded. This forced the Ministry of Health in Gaza to distribute the injured to hospitals in the central and southern Gaza Strip, including the European Gaza Hospital. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is also under great pressure, after exceeding its capacity to receive people wounded in the Israeli attacks on towns and refugee camps in the central Gaza Strip, including Deir el-Balah, Nuseirat and Bureij. Al-Aqqad urges international health and human rights organisations to intervene to stop “this hideous war” on Gaza. “I have never seen in my lifehospitals that are besieged and bombedout of service and forced to discharge patients to leave their hospital beds before completing their recovery process,” he says. “What we are experiencing is the worst of all. Save what remains of the people of Gaza.”",Published On 29 Nov 2023

Egypt’s Sinai Bedouins fear Is­rael’s mass dis­place­ment of Gaza Pales­tini­ans,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/29/egypts-sinai-bedouins-fear-israels-mass-displacement-of-gaza-palestinians,"Bedouin tribes in Sinai have long taken a hit from geopolitical conflicts. Now, concerns are rising again. As Israel’s war on Gaza nears the end of a second month, Rehab Eldalil worries about reports ofefforts by Israelto push the 2.3 million people of the besieged Gaza Strip into the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula – her ancestors’ home. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has publicly stated thatEgypt will not allow a displacementof Palestinians, as it would mean “the end of the Palestinian cause” and a potential threat to Egypt’s national security. But news reports have suggested that Israel might offer to pay off some of Egypt’s vast public debt in exchange for allowing the forced displacement of people from Gaza into Sinai. Eldalil, an Egyptian photographer and storyteller of Bedouin descent, worries that that kind of narrative “takes away the right of Palestinians to stay on their land, while promoting that Sinai is an empty desert for Palestinians to go to”. It is not, and hasn’t been for centuries. The 61,000sq km (23,500sq mile) triangle of land that bridges Africa and Asia is a popular tourist destination, a significant religious and historical site, and an important economic centre for Egypt. It is home to several oil and natural gas fields, as well as the Suez Canal, one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, which generates up to $9bn annually. The peninsula, its northern two-thirds taken up by the Sinai Desert and the mountainous south boasting St Catherine, Egypt’s highest peak, has also long been home to myriad Bedouin tribes, who lived according to their traditions for centuries, some eventually settling into towns. These communities have often been neglected by the authorities, and have been collateral damage in national or regional geopolitical conflicts. Now, the war on Gaza is raising fears for Bedouins. Before colonial powers drew borders to create the countries in the region today, the Arabian Peninsula, the Levant and North Africa were linked by merchant routes that offered the region a common language. The vectors of this phenomenon were the Bedouin Arab tribes. Eventually, Eldalil says, “These communities … they stopped being nomads, they settled as the first natives of this desert over 1,000 years ago,” something she would hear from the elders of her tribe, the Jabaliya (people from the mountain). “At the beginning, they split the Peninsula into seven major tribes,” she says, which have now developed into a total of 33, according to experts. Eldalil, who has several visual projects about Bedouin identity and heritage, says the legacy of these original tribes is still alive. “Embroidery is a huge tradition that the community still practices, as well as Bedouin traditional poetry, where they get to tell their stories,” she says. And there is the Bedouin law. “If there is an issue… they would have a sit-down between the families in dispute and fix it in a more civilised manner that you would see in many progressive countries,” she says. “They have their own set of rules and unspoken laws, something that with time has created a lot of issues between them and the government, just like it happens with any other indigenous community in the world,” Eldalil adds. Their deep connection to the land has added to those tensions with the authorities, she says. “They are able to walk for days and weeks within the desert, they know every inch of sand and corner of the mountains. They know their land so well that it becomes intimidating, and there arises a need to control them.” Scholar Hilary Gilbert says Bedouins have an “environmental identity”, based on her decades of research into Bedouin life. “They see themselves as being an integral part of the natural world, and so they see themselves very much as its guardians,” the University of Nottingham research fellow in anthropology and development added. Many of these “guardians of the natural world” refused to leave their land when Israel invaded the Sinai Peninsula in 1967, an occupation that lasted 15 years, leading to a lot of suspicion directed towards them from many non-Sinai Egyptians, Gilbert said. “A popular belief was that Bedouins were collaborating with the Israelis, an ingrained prejudice against them on the basis that they’re different, uncultivated and untrustworthy,” she added. “When Israel left and the Egyptians took over the government again, they adopted a sort of policy of benign neglect of the Bedouins.” For years, Bedouins found it hard to access their rights as citizens. National identity cards and paperwork were nearly impossible to come by, schools, hospitals and public services were scarce, and entering the army was forbidden. When Sinai was “discovered” in the late 1980s as a region that could make Egypt a tourism revenue, the Bedouins who lived there did not benefit – in fact, they found themselves displaced and disadvantaged, according to Eldalil. During 2011’s Arab Spring, the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza became a path for armed fighters and weapons transit, bringing the Sinai Bedouins under increased scrutiny from the Egyptian state. Around the same time, the rise of armed groups like ISIL(ISIS)-affiliated Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis deepened the Egyptian government’s security concerns in Sinai. When current President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi took power in 2013, he launched a campaign against armed groups in the Sinai. That included the creation of a 79km (49-mile) buffer zone in North Sinai, along the border with the Gaza Strip, in 2014. To do that, his forces demolished more than 3,255 residential, commercial and administrative buildings between 2013 and 2015, and forcefully evicted thousands of people, according to a Human Rights Watch report. “My father’s home became sort of a desert,” says Eldalil, whose father used to live in North Sinai. “All the homes next to him have been deserted because of the campaign to fight terrorism.” Those forced to leave by the army dispersed to a number of Egyptian cities, including al-Arish, Ismailia and Sharqiya, west of the Suez Canal. They were promised that their eviction would be short, only until the “elimination of terrorism”, local sources told Al Jazeera. However, these communities are still displaced, although the Egyptian government has changed its approach towards the Bedouins since 2018 by allying with different tribes to collaborate on intelligence and security in Sinai. In August, some of these Bedouins held a 48-hour sit-in in the southern area of Sheikh Zuweid, demanding the right to return to their lands. Followed by promises from the authorities that returns would begin on October 20, the sit-in was dissolved. With the mounting security concerns around the Rafah crossing since the hostilities in Gaza started on October 7, local Egyptian authorities seem to have changed their minds. “The moment came and it was not time to return,” a member of these Bedouin communities tells Al Jazeera. “In October, dozens of people from the Sawarka and Rumailat tribes gathered again […] but members of the armed forces dispersed the gathering and arrested a number of young people.” Some organisations that work with refugees began to welcome Bedouins too, in cities like Cairo and Alexandria. “The government could easily cooperate with the communities, understand more about the land, about the landscape and how to manage it,” says Eldalil. “After all, protecting their land is one of the biggest sources of pride for Indigenous peoples.” This is a sentiment shared by Palestinians who already live in Sinai. Mohammed* is one of the thousands of Palestinians who were born and raised in the Sinai after the mass expulsion of Palestinians during the creation of Israel in 1948, or the Nakba, Arabic for catastrophe. “Palestinians in North Sinai make up more than one-third of the population, and even if some of us are still unable to get our Egyptian citizenship because of strict laws, we are treated as Egyptians,” Mohammed says. “Us and Bedouins are the same people, have the same blood.” Bedouins in Sinai, he says, have been helping Palestinians who were stuck in the desert when the current war started, and have been volunteering to provide relief to injured Palestinians coming from Gaza since the partial opening of the Rafah crossing in early November. Now, as fears mount that a forced exodus of people from Gaza into Sinai could, in turn, displace local communities, Eldalil hopes the government will continue to nurture the relationship between Cairo and the Bedouins of Sinai. “There are in fact people inhabiting Sinai: the Bedouin communities,” she says, “who also have the right to remain on their land, just like the Palestinians”. *Name changed at the person’s request to protect their identity.",Published On 29 Nov 2023
Push to ex­tend Is­rael-Hamas truce as dead­line looms,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/efforts-under-way-to-extend-israel-hamas-truce-for-second-time,"Mediators in tough talks to press for further extension of Gaza pause as regional leaders call for permanent ceasefire. International mediators wereworkingto secure a second extension to the truce in the Israel-Palestinian conflict as the pause in fighting was set to expire within hours. The crunch talks continued on Wednesday – the final day of a two-day extension of a truce in the Gaza war – over conditions to extend the deal, which is set to end early on Thursday. The negotiations, involving Israel and Hamas as well as key mediator Qatar with the United States and Egypt, were focused on the length of the extension and the exchange of captives for prisoners. Late on Wednesday, the Israeli army confirmed that two Israeli captives had been freed in Gaza, in advance of the expected release of 10 others. Thirty Palestinian women and children were to be released from Israeli jails. “The consensus now is that the truce will be extended” for another few days, said Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra. But “the most complex and difficult part of the negotiations” aimed at bringing the war in Gaza to an end permanently lies ahead, he said. Those more advanced negotiations are expected to revolve around the release of Israeli soldiers held in Gaza, Ahelbarra said, explaining that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad may seek to secure the release of all Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. “The Israelis have made it clear that there’s absolutely no way they will go for that,” he said.

While Israel has welcomed the release of many captives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasised on Wednesday that his forces will resume the campaign to eliminate Hamas. “After this phase of returning our abductees is exhausted, will Israel return to fighting? So my answer is an unequivocal yes,” he said. “There is no way we are not going back to fighting until the end.” The initial four-day truce began on Friday. Despite some minor clashes, it was thenrenewedfor two more days. In that time, Hamas released 81 captives, mostly Israeli nationals, who weretakenduring an attack on southern Israel on October 7. In exchange, Israel released 180 Palestinian prisoners, including women and children, many of whom were kept in administrative detention for yearswithout charge. At the same time, Israel hasarrested almost as many Palestiniansas the prisoners it has released. United Nations Secretary-GeneralAntonio Guterresurged the parties to seek a “true humanitarian ceasefire” in order to address the “epic”humanitarian catastrophein Gaza, wrought by weeks of relentless Israeli assaults that have displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and a siege that has slashed access to necessities such as food, fuel, water and electricity. “In a matter of weeks, a far greater number of children have been killed by [the] Israeli military operations in Gaza than the total number of children killed in any year by any party to a conflict since I’ve been secretary-general,” Guterres told the UN Security Council on Wednesday. “Over the past few days, the people in the occupied Palestine territories and Israel have finally seen a glimmer of hope and humanity in so much darkness.” Speaking to the council about the extended truce, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said the deal has allowed more “badly needed” humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. He said Qatar was eager to see the council take steps towards applying a “sustainable ceasefire”, and implementing measures to guarantee the flow of “sufficient humanitarian aid, and to secure the delivery thereof without any impediments”.

Al Jazeera’s Ahelbarra said that Hamas is looking for guarantees from the key parties of the Gaza truce, the Qataris and the Egyptians, that if they keep going with the exchange of prisoners, Israel will stop the bombardment of Gaza. While Israel’s firm stance in favour of continuing the war in Gaza does provide leverage in negotiations, strong statements from all the leaders in the region about the need for a comprehensive settlement have put Israel under pressure, he added. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud called on the council to “live up to its responsibilities” and enforce a lasting ceasefire in Gaza. “The danger is that if this … truce expires, that we will return to the killing at the scale that we have seen, which is unbearable,” he told reporters at UN headquarters. “We are here to make a clear statement – that a truce is not enough. What is needed is a ceasefire,” he said. >Israel had previously said it was willing to extend the truce by one day for every 10 captives freed by Hamas, and an Israeli official told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Israel believes Hamas has enough women and children held captive to extend the current truce by an additional two to three days. The Wall Street Journal additionally reported that Israel was open to new negotiations over the release of men and soldiers “once all children and women are released”. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking in Brussels on Wednesday, said he would work with the Israelis during an upcoming trip to Israel to see if the temporary ceasefire could be extended. Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst, Marwan Bishara, said he believes Blinken will tell Israeli leaders during his visit to Tel Aviv that Washington cannot continue to support its war on Gaza “unconditionally”. The US, which has provided staunch support for Israel throughout the war, has outlined a series of “red lines” for Israel, Bishara explained, including no Israeli “reoccupation” of Gaza, no ethnic cleansing in Gaza and no shrinking of the territory of Gaza.

Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said there were “leaks coming out that there are negotiations between Israel and Hamas to release additional captives and extend the ceasefire” for five days. If successful, the next phase of the truce and captives’ release will reportedly be based around five categories, he said, “Israeli captives; elderly men who are too old to be reservists; female soldiers; reservist soldiers; and then the bodies of Israelis who were killed before or during captivity.” Ghazi Hamad, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, confirmed the group is ready to discuss the release of captured men and military personnel, as well as women and children. “Now this point is on the table,” the Hamas official told Al Jazeera. “For the whole of captives, either military or civilians. We’re still discussing it with the mediators in order to reach a satisfying compromise.”",Published On 29 Nov 2023
Pro-Pales­tine Face­book post sparks CIA warn­ing,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/cia-cautions-staff-on-social-media-use-after-officers-pro-palestine-post,"The incident illustrates the deep divisions that the war in Gaza has opened up within US government institutions. The CIA has stressed to its officers that they should refrain from political statements on social media after one of its top officers shared a pro-Palestinian photo on Facebook. The intelligence agency’s associate deputy director for analysis changed their Facebook cover photo to a man waving a Palestinian flag on October 21, two weeks after Israel launched an all-out offensive against Palestinian group Hamas, the Financial Timesreported. The officer reportedly deleted the post, along with another previously shared image with the words “Free Palestine”, after being contacted by the media. The agency has since sent out an internal memo reiterating its policy against political messaging on social media, NBC News reported. The CIA is the US’s top foreign intelligence agency, responsible for delivering intelligence and analysis to the president. The official at the centre of the recent social media incident previously led the development of a top-secret document titled the President’s Daily Brief, the Financial Times reported. Posting politically charged content on social media is highly unusual for officials with such sensitive intelligence roles. The social media post from the senior CIA officer underlines deep divisions within the US government over President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed some 15,000 Palestinians and left much of the besieged Gaza Strip in ruins. While Biden has offered staunch backing to Israel’s government, despite the mounting death toll, hundreds of government officials and former campaign staffers have signedopen lettersurging him to lobby for a ceasefire to protect Palestinians. The social media incident also comes after other US government officials faced backlash for their public comments about the Gaza war. Last week, a former US State Department official wasarrestedafter videos of him harassing a halal food vendor in New York and calling for more Palestinian children to die went viral on social media.

Hamas in­vites Elon Musk to Gaza to wit­ness ‘mas­sacres and de­struc­tion’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/hamas-invites-elon-musk-to-gaza-to-see-the-destruction-with-his-own-eyes,"As Palestinians take stock of the devastation wreaked by Israel’s military, Hamas says the world should do the same. Hamas invited Elon Musk to the Gaza Strip to witness the scope of the devastation caused by Israel’s bombardment, but the tech billionaire said it was “dangerous there right now”. The invitation from senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan came on Tuesday.  “Seems a bit dangerous there right now, but I do believe that a long-term prosperous Gaza is good for all sides,” Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns. He hadvisiteda kibbutz the previous day that was targeted by Hamas gunmen during theOctober 7 attackin southern Israel and declared his commitment to do whatever was necessary to stop the spread of hatred. Hamdan called on Musk, who recently met Israel’s prime minister and president, to also visit Palestine and acquire a more rounded perspective. “We invite him to visit Gaza to see the extent of the massacres and destruction committed against the people of Gaza, in compliance with the standards of objectivity and credibility,” Hamdan said in a press conference in Beirut. “Within 50 days, Israel dropped more than 40,000 tonnes of explosives on the homes of defenceless Gazans,” the official added. Musk has recently facedcriticismthat his social media platform is rife withanti-Semitismand white nationalist rhetoric promoting violence and hatred. During his visit to Israel, Musk expressed shock upon seeing the decimated kibbutz ofKfar Aza,saying that Israel had“no choice” but to eliminate Hamas. He also struck an agreement under which “Starlink satellite units [would] only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications, including the Gaza Strip,” a sharp turn from his previousmusing that he could provide Starlinkto enhance communications in Gaza amid numerous telecommunications blackouts. The Hamas official also called on the United States “to review [its] relationship with Israel and to stop supplying them with weapons,” and for the international community to quickly send specialised civil defence teams to help retrieve thousands of bodies from beneath the rubble.",Published On 29 Nov 2023
Is­rael-Hamas truce: How much aid has en­tered Gaza?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/israel-hamas-truce-has-it-helped-relieve-gazas-humanitarian-crisis,"Aid has come in, some of it reaching north Gaza too. But it’s too little, warn humanitarian agencies. As the truce between Israel and Hamas extends into its sixth day, aid groups are warning that the war-battered Gaza Strip is on the brink of a full-scale humanitarian crisis. After nearly two months of Israeli bombardment of Gaza, the “humanitarian pause” was brokered to allow the release of Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. As part of the agreement, more humanitarian aid has been allowed into the Palestinian enclave that has been under near-total siege. But while United Nations agencies and groups like the Palestine Red Crescent Society have been able to scale up aid entering the enclave through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the temporary increase has been insufficient to meet the now critical needs of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, nearly80 percentof which is now displaced. Here’s a breakdown of the aid that Gaza needs, and what it is receiving — even during the truce. The humanitarian pause began at 7am local time on Friday. Initially brokered for four days, it was extended on Tuesday for two days, which will expire on Thursday morning. As of Tuesday night, Hamas had released 81 of the 240 hostages taken captive while Israel had freed about 180 Palestinian prisoners. Aid distribution efforts had previously stalled, with agencies warning that perishables were spoiling at the Egyptian border. Now, amid the logistic chaos of the renewed flows, they have been able to deliver limited assistance to the population. Reporting for Al Jazeera from the southern town of Khan Younis, Hind Khoudary said on Tuesday that at least 750 trucks had crossed the Rafah border into Gaza since Friday. That works out to roughly 150 trucks per day. However, on Monday, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) told Al Jazeera that 200 trucks of aid would be needed daily over a period of two months to meet the population’s basic needs. Much more fuel is needed to enable the UN agency to power vital services such as sewage treatment plants and water desalination plants. Even that — 200 trucks a day — falls far short of what Gaza, under a land, sea and air siege by Israel since 2007, was receiving before October 7. Before the current war,500 aid truckswould enter Gaza daily on average, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Last week,Oxfamdescribed the pause as “a band-aid to a bleeding wound”. The war has devastated Gaza, killing nearly 15,000 people, with at least 6,800 presumed dead under the rubble. Tens of thousands of injured people have suffered due to medical shortages. While the truce has enabled Palestinians in the besieged enclave a little breathing space and some respite from the constant din of drones and warplanes, the humanitarian situation is dire. Israel’s war has split the territory of 2.3 million people in two. As its attacks on the north intensified, the Israeli military forced people to move south, where supplies of food, fuel and water have been scarce. International NGO ActionAid said deliveries were largely limited to the south, where 1.8 million people are now displaced. “For many women propping up households and facing more mouths to feed in Gaza’s overstretched shelters, renewed pauses will not come anywhere near close to helping improve the situation they’re facing,” said the NGO. Al Jazeera’s Khoudary said: “[Palestinian] people are starving, they are striving to find food in the supermarkets and people don’t have the basic needs to continue and to help themselves to survive from starvation…” OCHA said aid had reached heavily damaged northern areas, where many have remained – including vulnerable groups such as the elderly, injured and disabled people – amid intense air raids on homes, schools and hospitals. But it acknowledged that most of the assistance hadreached only Gaza’s south. The situation in the north remains dangerous, with concerns about dehydration and outbreaks of disease. Deliveries of fuel to the north have been severely restricted by Israeli forces. The Kamal Adwan Hospital, the only medical facility still operating in the zone, has been starved of supplies necessary for operations. “If the hospital is not supplied with fuel within hours, the department is at risk of losing those in it, including premature babies, under our care,” Dr Hossam Abu Safiya, head of the paediatric intensive care department, told Al Jazeera. On Sunday, Cindy McCain, director of the UN World Food Programme, said the entire enclave was “on the brink of famine”. “This is something that … will spread. And with that comes disease and … everything else that you can imagine,” she told CBS, the US network. As the truce inches to a possible end, residents fear the bombing will resume. Israel, which is intent on obliterating Hamas’s presence in the enclave, has been briefing that the armed group has a command and control centre in southern Gaza. While the south has been dubbed a “safe zone”, the Israeli military had repeatedly attacked Khan Younis prior to the truce. People in the south had been ordered to move towards a slice of the territory, called Muwasi, along the coast. Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN chief Guterres, said negotiations must continue so that the truce in Gaza could be upgraded to a full humanitarian ceasefire. “This aid barely registers against the huge needs” of Gaza, he said.",Published On 29 Nov 2023

Israel said on Tuesday that 10 of its citizens and two Thai nationals were freed by Hamas and had been returned to Israel, bringing the total number of freed captives to 86 from about 240 people taken to the Gaza Strip after Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel. Soon after, Israel released 30 Palestinians from its jails, bringing the total number of freed prisoners to 180. The list of released Palestinians included the names of 15 children – 12 from Jerusalem and three from the occupied West Bank – and 15 women – five from Jerusalem and 10 from the West Bank. Late on Monday, Qatar announced an agreement to extend the initial four-day pause for an additional two days, under which further prisoner exchanges will be carried out. The truce is due to end after one more exchange on Wednesday night. However, the heads of the US and Israeli intelligence agencies were in Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, to discuss extending the truce and releasing more people.",Published On 29 Nov 2023

Whole neighbourhoods have been erased. Homes, schools and hospitals have been blasted by air raids and scorched by tank fire. Some buildings are still standing, but most are battered shells. The ceasefire has allowed residents who remained in Gaza City and other parts of the north to venture out to survey the destruction and try to locate and bury relatives. A United Nations-led aid consortium estimates that more than 234,000 homes have been damaged across Gaza and 46,000  destroyed, amounting to about 60 percent of the housing stock in the territory, which is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians. In the north, the destruction of homes and civilian infrastructure “severely compromises the ability to meet basic requirements to sustain life”, it said. Israel’s bombardment and ground offensive have displaced more than 1.8 million people, nearly 80 percent of Gaza’s population, with most having sought refuge in the south, according to the UN humanitarian affairs office. Israeli troops have barred people from returning to the north during the ceasefire. The UN says the truce made it possible to scale up the delivery of food, water and medicine to the largest volume since the start of the war and to bring in desperately needed fuel for homes, hospitals and water treatment plants. But the 160 to 200 trucks a day is still less than half of what Gaza was importing before the fighting, even as humanitarian needs have soared. Five days into the truce, residents were still waiting for hours to buy gas and cooking fuel.",Published On 29 Nov 2023
Is­rael-Hamas war up­dates: Ten more Is­raeli cap­tives re­leased in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/29/israel-hamas-war-live-more-palestinian-prisoners-israeli-captives-freed,"The ministry’s spokesman Majed al-Ansari said on X that included among the captives released today are two minors and six women “of dual nationality”. Among them are a Russian, a Mexican and a Uruguayan, all of whom hold dual citizenship with Israel.  The Palestinian Prisoners Society says at least 40 Palestinians have been arrested in the last 24 hours across the occupied West Bank. Among those arrested are two women, as well as former detainees, it said. Arrests took place in the cities of Hebron, Bethlehem, Qalqilya, Tubas and Jericho. The figures include arrests made from homes and at military checkpoints, as well as those who were forced to surrender themselves “under pressure”, it said. This brings the total number of Palestinians who have been arrested by Israeli forces since October 7 to more than 3,365, it added. This live page is now closed.

For a first-hand account of a “hurt, scared” Palestinian boy who was released from Israeli detention, read our storyhere. A Nakba is unfolding in the occupied West Bank, too, writes Mariam Barghouti. Find out why she believes so inthis opinion piece. We will soon be closing this live page. Here’s a recap of today’s key events. We are receiving reports from the Palestinian Red Crescent that a young man was injured by Israeli gunfire near the Ofer military prison, west of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, where clashes have been reported ahead of the release of prisoners as part of the Gaza truce deal. Reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank At the moment, we are still waiting here with many family and friends of the detainees. There seems to have been some delay because of confrontations between Israeli security forces and some Palestinians in Beitunia, where Ofer Prison is located. So what we know at this stage is that the International Red Cross has arrived at the prison and that all those who are to be released have been there for several hours. The detainees who are set to be released have probably been going through a practice, which some of those who have been released told us about, which is basically a sort of an interview with intelligence officers, army officers, inside the prison. During this process, detainees are given guidelines, or threats, as the Palestinians call them, not to speak to the media, not to celebrate their freedom, not to post anything on social media. They are presumably given stern warnings that they could be detained again if any of these happens. Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem When it comes to a further extension of the [truce] deal, that we are already in day six of, the Israelis have not confirmed anything. But Israeli media is reporting that the war cabinet is meeting to discuss a possible extension. So we are waiting for more news on a possible extension of that ceasefire. With US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s arrival in Israel, some are hoping it will sway the Israelis to go in that direction so the resumption of fighting does not continue tomorrow. Mohammad Salhab Tamimi, 18, was released from Israeli prison on Tuesday as part of the Gaza truce deal. After being held for eight months without charges, he was finally able to see his family. But what he endured will stay with him for a long time. He described abuse during his transfer to Ofer Prison ahead of his release. “The officer then kicked me, hard. His boots have steel in them, so it felt like he crushed my feet, it really hurt,” Tamimi told Al Jazeera. Read our full story about his ordealhere. On the UN’s day of solidarity with the Palestinian people, marches took place across the globe calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. But this day has a special resonance with South Africans, given their own recent history of living under apartheid. They say that Palestinians are going through exactly what people of colour in South Africa went through for decades. Al Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller has more from Johannesburg.  This is a modal window.

Suheila Barghouti, a 65-year-old Palestinian woman who was arrested after the October 7 Hamas attack in Israel, is among the Palestinian detainees expected to be released tonight. Her sister-in-law, Eman Nafa, told Al Jazeera that Barghouti was arrested alongside several members of her family. “They arrested many of her family members. They brought them in the middle of the night and ordered them on the ground. They covered their eyes and started hitting them,” said Nafa, who is the wife of the longest-serving Palestinian prisoner, Nael Barghouti. One of Suheila Barghouti’s sons is also in prison, and she has been constantly worried that other family members would be harassed, if not arrested, if she talks about her mistreatment in prison in public, Nafa said. “She’s starving in prison, and they don’t even have electricity in her room, and they took her clothes. Today we expect her to be released.”   ",Published On 29 Nov 2023
"Group stages ‘die-ins’ across Wash­ing­ton, DC to raise aware­ness for Gaza",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/group-stages-die-ins-across-washington-dc-to-raise-awareness-for-gaza,"Silent protesters are using visual depictions of dead Palestinian children to highlight the toll of Israel’s war to passersby. Washington, DC –Julia Fawzi Saeed Al-Kurd was one year old. She was killed along with several members of her family in an Israeli air raid on Deir al-Balah in central Gaza on October 11. Her name appeared in local reports on the day of the bombing and later on a list of people killed in Israeli attacks, released by thePalestinian health ministryin Gaza. As with thousands of other Palestinians who have been wiped out in the Israeli offensive, little is publicly known about Julia beyond her death. Had she uttered her first word? Did she take her first step? What was her favourite toy? What lullaby did her parents sing to put her to sleep? But in Washington, DC, some activists are trying to keep the memory of children like Julia alive, with a provocative reminder of the young lives lost during the war in Gaza. On a chilly Sunday morning in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood, the activists protested silently, passing out leaflets to passersby. At their feet were a row of small figures wrapped in white shrouds, each splattered in blood — and each bearing the name of a real childkilled in Gaza. Julia’s name was on one of them. “We are witnessing a genocide in Gaza. End the injustice NOW,” the flyer read, urging a ceasefire and an end to United States military support for Israel. The protest was one of daily demonstrations across the Washington area led by an informal group called Die-in for Humanity. Hazami Barmada organised the protests in an effort to break through pre-conceived notions about the Gaza war, with stark reminders of the humanity of those under siege. Barmada, who is of Palestinian and Syrian descent, estimates the group has handed out more than 14,000 flyers so far. “The reality is our social media turns into echo chambers and people read the news they want to read,” she said. “So we go into places where your average person is walking around and try to provoke deeper questions and reflections on what’s happening and more awareness about what’s happening to Palestinians.” Israeli attacks have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians since October 7, making the war one of the deadliest conflicts forcivilians and childrenin modern history. Where possible, Barmada and her fellow volunteers lie on the ground during protests to mirror the bodies of Palestinians killed in Israeli raids. “We really hope that people will stop and actually start to question the toll of war, the toll of endorsing this with our tax dollars,” Barmada told Al Jazeera, referring to Washington’s military aid to Israel. She said the protesters want to make people feel “uncomfortable within a controlled environment” in order to spark meaningful conversations. “It’s really easy to see statistics online and to divorce yourself from it,” Barmada said. “Our goal is when someone walks by with their own kids, when you see body bags with children’s names and ages written on them that are the same age as your kids, it provokes a different type of emotional reaction.”  This is a modal window.

This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  The group has held so-called die-in protests at theWhite House, State Department and various neighbourhoods throughout the US capital. Part of the group’s goal is to prompt questions about the US role in the conflict. President Joe Biden and his top aides have expressed staunch support for Israel and Washington has not drawnany “red lines”to limit how Israel can use the military aid it receives, according to officials. Israel, which leading rights groups accuse ofimposing apartheidon Palestinians, receives at least $3.8bn in US aid annually, and Biden is seeking $14bn in additional assistance for the country this year. Barmada called Biden’s stance disappointing, saying that the war will be a “stain” on his legacy. “Their handling of this entire issue has not only fuelled fear-mongering, it’s also dehumanised Palestinians. It’s also fuelled animosityand hatred,” she said. On Capitol Hill on Sunday, many pedestrians nodded approvingly at the protesters or gave them a thumbs up. But Barmada said the reactions were not always positive. Just a day earlier, the protesters faced a profanity-laden, racist tirade from a woman who accused them of terrorism and told Barmada to “go back to whatever f***ing country” she came from. Avideoof that interaction has gone viral on social media. Barmada said she tries to absorb such anger and hatred without reacting to it.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

She told Al Jazeera that she started the die-ins after seeing footage of aPalestinian motherwhispering in her dead child’s ear in Gaza. It reminded her of how she puts her own child to sleep. “All I could imagine in that moment was: What would I do if that was my son?” she said, struggling to hold back the tears. Barmada added that her sorrow made her spring into action. “There was no conscious decision. There was no process or plan. It was in that moment of deep despair, I couldn’t unsee my own child. And if I can get people here to see their own children, if I can get people here to see their own humanity tied to these body bags, then that to me is a success.”",Published On 28 Nov 2023
Hamas re­leas­es 12 more cap­tives as truce with Is­rael holds for fifth day,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/draft-hamas-releases-fifth-round-of-hostages-to-red-cross,"Israel releases 30 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for 10 Israeli hostages, according to mediator Qatar. Hamas has released 12 more hostages, the Israeli military and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have said, as a shaky truce continues to hold in Gaza. The ICRC said that it successfully facilitated the release and transfer of 12 hostages out of Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Tuesday, the fifth day of an extended six-day truce between Israel and the Palestinian armed group in Gaza. The Israeli army said 10 Israelis and two Thai nationals had arrived in Israel. In exchange for the release of the 10 Israelis, 30 Palestinian prisoners were released fromIsraeli prisonslater, according to Qatar, a key mediator in the Israel-Hamas deal. The agreement provides for the possibility of extending the truce in return for the release of a further 10 captives each day. The Palestinian Prisoner’s Club said 15 women and 15 minors would be released. Among them was 14-year-old Ahmad Salayme. “The first day of the war there were a number of beatings, female inmates were beaten,” Salayme said in an interview with Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom. “They told me no celebrations, and on the day of my release I’m not allowed to leave my house, raise any signs or banners, use a megaphone,” he added. “And if I break any of these rules I will be taken back.” “We are very happy but our happiness is incomplete because we mourn those who are lost, those who are wounded and those who are missing,” he said, referring to the Palestinians in Gaza. Before his arrival, the boy’s relatives, his friends and journalists had been huddling in the living room in Ras al-Amoud, a neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, in silence as Israeli security forces were outside. Israeli authorities have warned the families of Palestinian women and children being released as part of the Gaza truce against celebrating their return home.  This is a modal window.

Dozens of hostages have sincebeen released, the vast majority through the Israel-Hamas deal that is set to expire early on Thursday. In addition to the exchanges, the deal includes a cessation of hostilities in Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the territory which Israel had bombarded and besieged for more than seven weeks. More than 15,000 people have been killed in the Israeli air and ground assault, including more than 6,000 children, according to Palestinian officials.

The heads of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel’s Mossad have met in Qatar to discuss theextension of a trucebetween Israel and Hamas as well as the captives being held by the Palestinian group in Gaza. CIA Director William Burns and David Barnea, head of the Mossad intelligence service, held talks with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani on Tuesday, a day after Doha announced atwo-day extensionof an originalfour-day humanitarian pausein Gaza that had been due to expire. “We have to read a little bit between the lines here: [The intelligence chiefs were] important in the last meeting, which was on November 9. We believe that was one of the stepping stones getting us to the initial four-day deal,” Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays said. “The fact that we’ve got intelligence chiefs sitting here with the Qatari prime minister, who is also the foreign minister, is interesting because they’ve got the intelligence picture. But also I think it’s interesting partly because of who the US has got leading this effort,” he said, adding that Burns is “more experienced a negotiator than Antony Blinken”, the US secretary of state.

Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the original truce. But they have continued to swap captives for prisoners. Hamas has released captives in its custody, with another 12 freed on Tuesday.  Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a post on X that 30 Palestinian prisoners are set to be released. On Monday, mediator Qatar said a humanitarian pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas would be extended by two days, hours before the initial four-day truce in Gaza was set to expire. Qatar, the US and Egypt have engaged in intensenegotiations to establish and prolong the trucein Gaza. Over the course of the initial pause, Hamas released 69 captives – 51 Israelis and 18 people of other nationalities. In exchange, 150Palestinian prisoners– 117 children and 33 women – held in Israeli prisons were released and more humanitarian aid was allowed into Gaza. The talks between the US and Israeli intelligence chiefs and Qatar were also attended by Egyptian officials. “Is there a way that they can try and deal with the central problem here of keeping this [current truce] going while Israel at the same time wants to remove Hamas?” Bays asked. “We don’t know anything from the information on the ground, but one possibility that some are suggesting is perhaps a deal could be done for the Hamas military leadership to be persuaded to go into exile in another country,” he said. “That’s certainly not what we’re hearing from Israeli media sources; the latest we’re hearing from them is that the Israeli government does not want an extension beyond 10 days in total, taking us until the end of Sunday,” according to Bays. Meanwhile, far-right Israeli Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow soldiers to return to fighting in Gaza to “crush Hamas” as he reacted to an army statement that three explosive devices were detonated in two locations near troops in northern Gaza. “We must not wait until our fighters are killed. We must once again act in accordance with the goal of the war: the total destruction of Hamas,” the minister posted on X.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Is­rael ar­rests al­most as many Pales­tini­ans as it has re­leased dur­ing truce,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/arrests,"Over the first four days of Israel-Hamas prisoner exchange, Israel arrests 133 Palestinians while releasing 150. Ramallah, occupied West Bank –Israel has persisted with arresting dozens of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem as it conducts a prisoner release with Hamas, the Gaza-based armed group. In the first four days of the ongoing truce between Israel and Hamas, which began on Friday, Israel released 150 Palestinian prisoners – 117 children and 33 women. Hamas released 69 captives – 51 Israelis and 18 people from other nations. Over the same four days, Israel arrested at least 133 Palestinians from East Jerusalem and the West Bank, according to Palestinian prisoner associations. “As long as there is occupation, the arrests will not stop. People must understand this because this is a central policy of occupation against Palestinians and to restrict any kind of resistance,” Amany Sarahneh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Prisoners Society, told Al Jazeera. “This is a daily practice – its not just after October 7,” she added. “We actually expected more people to be arrested during these four days.” The Qatar-mediated truce came after 51 days of relentless Israeli bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, which began on October 7, the day Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israeli territory, killing about 1,200 people. Israel has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since then, the majority of them women and children. On Monday, the original four-day truce was extended for another two days, during which an additional 60 Palestinians and 20 captives are expected to be released. Under Israel’s 56-year military occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israeli forces carry out nightly raids into Palestinian homes, arresting 15 to 20 people on “calm” days. In the first two weeks after October 7, Israeldoubled the numberof Palestinians in its custody from 5,200 people to more than 10,000. That number included 4,000 labourers from Gaza who worked in Israel and were detained before later being released back into Gaza. Palestinian prisoner lawyers and monitoring groups have recorded 3,290 arrests in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7. In mid-November,35-year-old Eyad Banatwas arrested while he was streaming live on TikTok. He was subsequently released. Since the truce began, the streets of Ramallah have been flooded with people welcoming the freed prisoners. But the worry for Palestinian prisoners does not end after their release. The majority of those freed are usually rearrested by Israeli forces in the days, weeks, months and years after their release. Dozens of those who were arrested in a 2011 Israel-Hamas prisoner exchangewere rearrestedand had their sentences reinstated. Sarahneh said it is not yet clear whether Israel has provided any guarantees that it will not rearrest those who have been released. “There are no guarantees with the occupation. These people are liable to be rearrested at any point. The occupation always rearrests people who have been released,” she said. “The biggest evidence that these people may be rearrested is that the majority of people being detained now are freed prisoners,” she added. Since October 7, the conditions of Palestinians under arrest or in detention have severely declined. Many have complained ofsevere beatingswhile six Palestinian prisoners have died in Israeli custody. Many of the women and children released during the truce havetestifiedto the abuse they experienced in Israeli prisons. Several videos have also emerged in recent weeks of Israeli soldiers beating, stepping on, abusing and humiliating detained Palestinians who have been blindfolded, cuffed and stripped either partially or entirely. Many social media users said the scenes brought back memories of the torture tactics used by United States forces in Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison in 2003. In addition to severe beatings, Israeli prison authorities halted medical attention for Palestinian prisoners for at least the first week after October 7, including for those who had been beaten, according to rights groups. Family visits as well as routine lawyer visits were stopped, the groups said. Prisoners were previously entitled to three to four hours outside their cells in the yard, but that has now been cut to less than an hour, according to rights groups. Overcrowded cells now often house double the number of detainees they were built for with many sleeping on the floor without mattresses, they said. Israeli prison authorities have also cut electricity and hot water, conducted cell searches, removed all electrical devices including TVs, radios, cooking slabs and kettles, and shut down the canteen, which prisoners use to buy food and basic supplies such as toothpaste.",Published On 28 Nov 2023
One-star rat­ings and threats: Re­view-bomb­ing tar­gets firms amid Gaza war,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/one-star-ratings-and-threats-how-review-bombing-is-shaping-the-gaza-war,"Businesses in the US are reporting fiery online backlash to Palestinian products and messages about the war in Gaza. San Francisco, California –Every morning, when the coffee shop and art space Fayes opens its doors in San Francisco’s Mission District, an employee writes a message on the chalkboard perched outside. Usually, the message is funny or a plug for coffee and art. But last month, as the war in Gaza erupted, a different message appeared: “Solidarity with Gaza. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” Fayes co-owner Michael McConnell was out of town at the time the message went up. But when his phone started buzzing with notifications, he knew something was wrong. One-star reviews were pouring in on popular websites like Yelp. Some complained about “dirty looks” from staff, others about bad table service. But McConnell was suspicious. Fayes does not have tables at all. And a lot of the commenters appeared to be posting from other parts of the United States, as far away as New York and Michigan. That’s when it dawned on him: Fayes was in the middle of a review-bombing. Often used to describe coordinated online efforts to bombard individuals and organisations with criticism, review-bombing can have devastating repercussions, particularly for small businesses with few resources to weather the onslaught. McConnell is the first to admit that review-bombing pales in comparison to the destruction that has happened since thestart of the waron October 7. More than 14,800 Palestinianshave diedas well as1,200Israelis. But as he brews coffee after the morning rush, greeting some customers by name, McConnell reflects on his encounter with the woman who he believes sparked the online protest. “She said she wasn’t aware that we would get death threats or calls from Israel and overseas, and she didn’t know that we would get the Yelp reviews,” McConnell said. “And I was like, ‘I don’t know. What did you think was going to happen?’” McConnell added that it was disheartening that the woman did not think through what her posts would do to his business or its employees. But he remains optimistic. Google and Yelp have taken action to remove the review-bombing posts, and McConnell said he had a “lovely” conversation with someone who got in touch over Instagram to talk about the chalkboard message and its aftermath. He figures tourists might be turned off by the bad online ratings, but his regular customers will continue to rally around the coffee shop, known for its artwork and wall of rental DVDs. Melissa Ryan, a consultant focused on combatting extremism and toxicity online, said review-bombing participants are aware of the power of their words. But she believes the responsibility should lie with companies like Yelp and Google to prevent bullying and crack down on fake reviews. “It is on the platforms to be putting more energy and resources into that and to be thinking about their policies and be enforcing them,” Ryan said. “It’s one thing to be complaining about wait service that doesn’t exist. It’s another to call someone a terrorist and make threats.” Ten blocks away from Fayes, the Palestinian bakery and restaurant Reem’s likewise faced protest and review-bombing when it opened its first brick-and-mortar location in the nearby city of Oakland in 2017. Co-founder Zaynah Hindi said she and chef Reem Assil envisioned their restaurant as a welcoming place, branding it with the motto, “Arab street food made with California love.” But within a week of opening, the backlash began. “Google and Yelp were flooded with one-star reviews,” Hindi recalled as she sat at a table inside the bakery’s Mission District location. “Some were just blatantly like, ‘This is a terrorist establishment. There’s blood of children in their food,’ stuff like that. Then there are those who tried to disguise it, like, ‘I went there, and their food was terrible,’ and listed products that we don’t actually even serve.” Many commenters took issue with a painting inside the restaurant that depicted the Palestinian activist Rasmea Odeh, who was convicted in Israel of participating in a deadly bombing but maintains she confessed under torture. The online reactions, however, included threats against individual staff members, particularly Assil, the chef and owner, who was pregnant at the time. “Reem received very vile messages that I don’t even want to repeat, but they were very violent,” Hindi explained. But Hindi credits the community with keeping the bakery open. When protesters appeared outside the store, supporters showed up and linked arms to create safe passage for Reem’s workers and customers, she said. Now, with tensions over the war in Gaza high, Hindi hopes the restaurant can offer a safe space in return, particularly for Palestinians struggling with the scale of the violence. “In the last few weeks, Reem and I as Palestinians were absolutely devastated and feeling paralysed to be witnessing the genocide of our people in front of our very eyes,” Hindi said. “That is just heartbreaking.” She added she and her colleagues have no intention of closing their doors, no matter the backlash. “We’re not going anywhere,” she said. “When other people in our community see that, they say, ‘OK, Reem’s spoke out on this matter, and I feel like there’s space for me to do that too.’” Unfortunately, small business owners often struggle to survive protests without strong community backing, said Miriam Zouzounis, a commissioner with San Francisco’s Office of Small Business. Zouzounis works as an importer for Terra Sancta Trading Company, which distributes wine and spirits from the Middle East. She has seen firsthand how online backlash can sabotage sales. “We’ve had accounts that have lost business for highlighting our Palestinian wine,” she said. “They’re regular wine shops, and they’ll do a blurb, and then an event that was going to work with them cancels. Things like that have monetary fallout, but that’s pretty ubiquitous right now.” Zouzounis suspects the online attacks are part of a larger effort to shift the conversation away from the conflict in Gaza. “The Palestinian community doesn’t have the luxury to wallow in these ‘minutiae’ kind of fights,” she said. “That’s their strategy: to keep us distracted on all these fronts.” She notes Arab Americans are increasingly recognised as a powerful voting bloc. She wants to use that sway to push local politicians, like San Francisco’s city supervisors, to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. “Yes, we’re under attack here, but our people in Palestine are being killed,” she said. “So we need to ask for the city to take a stand on a ceasefire demand for their constituents.”",Published On 28 Nov 2023
What was the pur­pose of Elon Musk’s vis­it to Is­rael?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/elon-musks-israel-trip-what-was-the-purpose-what-did-he-tell-netanyahu,"X CEO Elon Musk, who has been accused of platforming anti-Semitic posts, visits kibbutzim attacked by Hamas. Billionaire tycoon Elon Musk, who has been accused of platforming anti-Semitic content on his social media platform X, on Monday met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during hisvisit to Israel. Accompanied by Netanyahu, the tech billionaire also visited a kibbutz that wasraided by Hamasfighters on October 7, during an assault that left 1,200 people dead and triggered Israel’s deadliest-ever military assault on Gaza. Nearly 15,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s bombardment of the coastal enclave. Musk was said to have backed Israel’s war on Gaza after the trip that came during the truce between Hamas and Israel. Musk also agreed to not provide internet access to Gaza through his satellite company Starlink without Israeli approval. Here is what to know about Musk’s visit to Israel and its significance. Musk’s visit to Israel, which came amid a truce between Hamas and Israel, follows backlash against a post on X that many have labelled asanti-Semitic,triggering a wave of advertisement withdrawals from the platform by corporate giants such as Apple and IBM, potentially costing X millions of dollars. Earlier this month, Musk agreed with a social media post accusing Jewish people of pushing “dialectical hatred” against white people. Musk’s remarks received condemnation in the United States from the White House for being “abhorrent”. Musk has also been accused of allowing advertisements from major corporations next to neo-Nazi and white nationalist content. X is also facing a probe from the European Union into the spread of disinformation and violent content about Israel’s war on Gaza. Musk has either criticised or denied findings from organisations such as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Center for Countering Digital Hate that X has witnessed an increase in hate speech since he became CEO last year. X has sued Media Matters after accusing the media watchdog of manipulating an algorithm to drive away advertisers. The watchdog has called the lawsuit “frivolous”. Escorted by Netanyahu and other security personnel, Musk toured the Kfar Aza kibbutz, attacked by Hamas fighters on October 7. He was also shown footage of the Hamas attack and met some of the families of people takeninto captivityfrom Israel. “It was jarring to see the scene of the massacre,” said Musk later in an X Spaces conversation with Netanyahu, adding Israel has “no choice” but to eliminate Hamas. In the brief life-streamed conversation on X, Musk and Netanyahu agreed that Hamas needs to be eradicated – a mission that Israel has used as justification for its military offensive that has claimed overwhelmingly civilian lives. “You first have to get rid of the poisonous regime as you did in Germany, as you did in Japan. Yeah, in World War II,” said Netanyahu. Musk replied, “There’s no choice. There’s no choice.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog told Musk during a meeting that he had a huge role to play in the global fight against anti-Semitism. “We have to do whatever is necessary to stop the hate,” Musk replied, according to a statement released by Herzog’s office. On the X space, Netanyahu said that Musk’s visit to Israel points to his solidarity with Israel. “The fact that you came here, I think, speaks volumes to your commitment to try to secure a better future”, he said. Netanyahu reminded Musk that the last time they spoke, the two had a conversation about artificial intelligence. He told the tech CEO that “great talents are available” in Israel and pointed to Israeli manufacturing of iPhones and operations of the navigation app, Waze. Netanyahu previouslymet Muskin California on September 18 where the Israeli prime minister urged him to strike a balance between protecting free expression and fighting hate speech after weeks of controversy over anti-Semitism on X. Musk responded by saying he was against anti-Semitism and against anything that “promotes hate and conflict”, repeating his previous statements that X would not promote hate speech. An Israeli government source described Monday’s visit as a follow-up to the September meeting. Musk’s visit to Israel is being criticised by some supporters of Israel and Palestine. Esther Solomon, editor-in-chief of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, blasted Musk’s trip as a “PR visit” in a post on X. In an opinion piece on the news site, Haaretz correspondent Ben Samuels alsosaidIsrael’s embrace of Musk is a “betrayal of Jews” and a “stain on Netanyahu’s legacy”. Musk has also been questioned online for not visiting Gaza despite the deaths and destruction wrought on the territory by Israeli bombs.  Musk reachedan agreementwith Israel “in principle” that internet access to Gaza may be provided through Starlink, but only using units operated by Israel and with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications. In October, CEO Musk had said that “Starlink will support connectivity to internationally recognised aid organisations in Gaza.” As Gaza plunged into darkness after its communicationsblackout in October, social media users pleaded with Musk to provide the besieged enclave with internet access through Starlink. The company uses satellite technology instead of cable technology to provide internet access, and also came to the aid ofUkrainewhen the country faced its own blackouts during its war with Russia. Musk’s instant provision of Starlink access to Ukraine prompted people to call him out for having “double standards” when it came to Israel’s war on Gaza. Israel has also previously opposed Starlink connectivity for Gaza, contesting that Hamas would use it for “terrorist activities”.",Published On 28 Nov 2023

"Dis­ease could kill more Pales­tini­ans in Gaza than bombs, says WHO",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/disease-could-kill-more-in-gaza-than-bombs-who-says-amid-israeli-siege,"Shattered healthcare and sanitation systems must be restored in Gaza, says World Health Organization. More people could die from disease than from bombings in the Gaza Strip if the health and sanitation systems are not repaired, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. Critical infrastructure in the besieged territory has been crippled byfuelandsupply shortagesand targeted attacks on hospitals and United Nationsfacilitiessince Israel launched strikes on Gaza on October 7. “Eventually we will see more people dying from disease than from bombardment if we are not able to put back together this health system,” said Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the WHO, speaking at a briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. She described the collapse ofal-Shifa Hospitalin northern Gaza as a “tragedy” and voiced concern about the detention of some of its medical staff by Israeli forces who took over the complex earlier this month. She also repeated concerns about a rise in outbreaks of infectious diseases in Gaza, particularly diarrhoeal diseases. Citing a United Nations report on the living conditions of displaced residents in northern Gaza, she said: “[There are] no medicines, no vaccination activities, no access to safe water and hygiene and no food.” All keysanitation serviceshave ceased operating in Gaza, which raises the prospect of an enormous surge of gastrointestinal and infectious diseases among the local populations –including cholera. For Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, half of whom are children, finding drinkable water has become close to impossible. The WHO has recorded more than 44,000 cases of diarrhoea and 70,000 acute respiratory infections, but real numbers may be significantly higher. The UN health agency said it was extremely concerned that rains and floods during the approaching winter season will make an already dire situation even worse. James Elder, a spokesperson from the UN children’s agency in Gaza, told reporters by video link that hospitals were full of children with war wounds and gastroenteritis from drinking dirty water. “They don’t have access to safe water and it’s crippling them,” he said. If nothing changes, “there will be more and more people falling sick and the risk of major outbreaks will increase dramatically”, Richard Brennan, the regional emergency director for the Eastern Mediterranean region at WHO,told Al Jazeeraearlier this month. Despite the temporarytruce agreementbetween Israel and Hamas, which was extended by two days just as it was set to expire on Tuesday morning, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health said no fuel had arrived for generators at hospitals in the territory’s north. UN official Tor Wennesland warned the humanitarian situation “remains catastrophic”. It “requires the urgent entry of additional aid and supplies in a smooth, predictable, and continuous manner to alleviate the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza,” the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process said. Gaza City Mayor Yahya al-Siraj said that without fuel, the territory could not pump clean water or clear waste accumulating in the streets, warning of a potential public health “catastrophe”. Clean-up was under way at al-Shifa, which is Gaza’s largest hospital. “We hope it can soon resume its activities,” said Gaza health ministry spokesman Mahmud Hammad. Israeli bombardment has killed more than 14,800 Palestinians, including 6,150 children and more than 4,000 women, according to health authorities in the enclave.  This is a modal window.

Blinken urges Is­rael to fin­ish probe into killing of jour­nal­ist in Lebanon,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/8/blinken-urges-israel-to-finish-probe-into-killing-of-journalist-in-lebanon,"Blinken’s comments come after rights groups say Israel should be investigated over possible war crime. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged Israel to conclude and release the findings of a probe into artillery strikes that killed a journalist and wounded six others in Lebanon. Blinken said on Thursday that it is “important and appropriate” that Israel thoroughly investigate the October 13 strike in southern Lebanon. “My understanding is that Israel has initiated such an investigation, and it will be important to see that investigation come to a conclusion and to see the results of the investigation,” the top US diplomat said during a news conference. Blinked also said he had “extraordinary admiration” for journalists working in dangerous regions around the world. Blinken’s comments came after separate investigations by Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International and the Reuters and AFP news agencies found that an Israeli tank was responsible for the October 13 strikes in southern Lebanon. The attacks killed Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah and injured six other journalists, including Al Jazeera cameraperson Elie Brakhia and reporter Carmen Joukhadar. Israel’s military has said it is reviewing the circumstances of the strikes but has yet to release any findings from its investigations. HRW said in its report on Thursday that the attacks appeared to be deliberate and, therefore, a war crime. “Witness accounts and video and photo evidence that Human Rights Watch verified indicate that the journalists were well removed from ongoing hostilities, clearly identifiable as members of the media, and had been stationary for at least 75 minutes before they were hit by two consecutive strikes,” the rights group said. “Human Rights Watch found no evidence of a military target near the journalists’ location.” Amnesty said its investigation showed that the Israeli military had likely carried out a “direct attack on civilians” and should be investigated for committing a potential war crime. At least 63 journalists have been killed since the start of the war in Gaza, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.",Published On 8 Dec 2023
Pales­tini­ans de­mand end to Is­rael’s un­re­lent­ing Gaza on­slaught,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/12/8/israel-hamas-war-live-palestinians-demand-end-to-israels-gaza-onslaught,"Videos circulating online and verified by Al Jazeera’s verification unit, Sanad news agency, showed the first moments after rockets hit an area near the US Embassy in Baghdad. In one verified video posted on X, siren alarm was overheard at dawn amid a series of mild and loud explosions near the embassy building. A loudspeaker also announced in English, “Duck and cover. Get away from the windows. Take cover and await further instructions.” A separate video posted on Facebook also showed the area of Baghdad’s diplomatic area as explosions were heard in the background. The incident comes as supporters of Palestinians in the region vowed retaliation against Israel and its close ally, the US, for the deadly war in Gaza.  Tributes have poured in following the reported death of renowned Palestinian poet and academicRefaat Alareer, who was killed alongside several family members in an Israeli strike on southern Gaza. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Pam Bailey, co-founder of We Are Not Numbers, a project established to tell the stories of Palestinians, said the death of Refaat was a huge loss. “I hope more young people will follow in his footsteps, tell those stories, and pay attention to them, and not just when there’s violence,” said Bailey, who knew Refaat from when she was based in Gaza. “A lot of people knew about Refaat, through his books, through his poetry. That’s why you are hearing about him today because so many people loved him for that,” she said, telling how he had humanised the struggles of people in Gaza. Bailey said that she also hopes that more people will read about the lives of everyday Palestinians to understand that “they need freedom, independence, they need dignity”.  UNICEF spokesman James Elder has told Al Jazeera that the lack of water, food, medicine and protection is becoming an even bigger threat than bombs to the lives of thousands in Gaza.

The United Arab Emirates has called on the UN Security Council to vote on Friday morning on a draft resolution that demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. “The situation in the Gaza Strip is catastrophic and close to irreversible. We cannot wait. The Council needs to act decisively to demand a humanitarian ceasefire,” the UAE mission to the UN said. The renewed push for a ceasefire was made after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, for the first time in his tenure, invoked thepowerful Article 99of the UN Charter, which allows him to “bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security”. Guterres has warned of the global implications of the war and highlighted the suffering inflicted on Palestinian civilians. For a resolution to be adopted, at least nine of the 15-member UN Security Council must vote in favour and none of the council’s five permanent members – the US, Russia, China, France, and the UK – must veto the resolution. Neither the US nor the UK supports a ceasefire in Gaza, arguing that Israel has a right to take military action. The US has also said that it does not support any action at the Security Council on the Israel-Gaza war at this time. Washington abstained from a vote last month to allow the Security Council to adopt a resolution calling for humanitarian pauses in fighting in Gaza. That allowed for a seven-day pause that saw captives in Gaza released by Hamas and Israel free Palestinian women and children from its prisons. The pause ended on December 1 amid a breakdown in negotiations. At least 17,177 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, and some 1,150 in Israel. Sameh Shoukry has said Palestinians “themselves don’t want to leave” the enclave so “they should not be forcibly displaced”. “Any form of displacement, whether internal or external, is a violation, and we will not become a party, basically, to such a violation,” he told CNN. “The liquidation of the Palestinians caused by removing all Palestinians from their territory is unacceptable, and as I said, is a violation of humanitarian law.” There are growing concerns around the mass displacement of Palestiniansinto Egypt’s Sinai peninsula, as large swathes of Gaza’s south have come under heavy bombardment in recent days, leaving few safe places for people to find refuge in the besieged enclave. Biden reiterated his call to increase the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians displaced in Israel’s continued offensive in Gaza in talks with King Abdullah II. “The President and King Abdullah affirmed their commitment to work together and with other regional partners to set the conditions for a durable and sustainable peace in the Middle East to include the establishment of a Palestinian state,” the White House said in a readout of the talks. In an interview with US network NBC, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi earlier said that the kingdom strongly opposes any plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza. Safadi also said that neither Jordan nor Egypt would accept the displacement of Palestinians from their own land or allow Israel “to proceed with its policies of transferring the crisis to the region”.  The remark by Don Davies, a Canadian parliament member from the left-wing New Democratic Party, comes just hours after news broke that Palestinian academic and poet Refaat Alareer was killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza. “Israel is now using sophisticated technology to target and kill leading Gazan academics, authors, historians, poets, artists, journalists, teachers,” Davies wrote on X. “These are not Hamas leaders. This is cultural genocide. “The world must intervene to stop this brutal crime against humanity.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has failed to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.  Injured Palestinians have been treated at central Gaza’s  Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital following an Israeli attack overnight on Gaza’s Deir el-Balah city. In an Al Jazeera video, the injured were seen being carried from ambulances into the hospital by civil defence workers and volunteers. In one scene, an injured toddler is treated on the floor of the hospital as no beds are available due to the high number of patients requiring treatment. It was reported earlier that the attack took place in the vicinity of the hospital. The exact number of casualties was not known.

Pho­tos: Death and dev­as­ta­tion in Gaza af­ter two months of Is­rael-Hamas war,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/7/photos-death-and-devastation-in-gaza-after-two-months-of-israel-hamas-war,"In Pictures Gaza has been ravaged by more than two months of relentless Israeli bombardment that has levelled entire neighbourhoods and delivered death and destruction to the enclave’s 2.3 million residents. Hospitals, schools and refugee camps have been targeted, with United Nations personnel and facilities also attacked by Israel at unprecedented rates. More than 17,000 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to Palestinian authorities, including more than 7,000 children. Hundreds of thousands of others have been displaced within the Gaza Strip and more than 46,000 people in Gaza have been injured since then. Less than 1 percent of wounded people have been evacuated via the Rafah Crossing to Egypt for treatment, Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said on Thursday. A week-long truce between Israel and Hamas was brokered by Qatar and other mediators to allow the release of captives taken by Hamas during its attack on southern Israel on October 7, which killed more than 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities. In exchange, Israel released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The truce collapsed on December 1 and fighting has resumed since.",Published On 7 Dec 2023
Iran’s Raisi says ‘geno­cide’ un­fold­ing in Gaza as he meets Rus­sia’s Putin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/irans-raisi-says-genocide-under-way-in-gaza-as-he-meets-russias-putin,"Putin hosts Raisi as part of a blitz round of Middle East diplomacy after visits to the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has condemned Israel’s assault on Gaza as he met Russian President Vladimir Putin for talks in Moscow. Putin hosted Raisi on Thursday as part of a blitz round of Middle East diplomacy that also included visits to United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in efforts to raise Moscow’s profile as a power broker in the region. Putin has cast the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza as a failure of US diplomacy and suggested Moscow could be a mediator in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Greeting Raisi at the Kremlin, Putin said it was important to discuss the situation in the Middle East, especially in the Palestinian territories. Raisi responded via a translator: “What is happening in Palestine and Gaza is, of course, genocide and a crime against humanity.” “It’s not just a regional issue, it’s an issue for the entire humankind,” he told Putin, adding that “it’s necessary to find a quick solution.” Iran backs the Palestinian group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip. Russia has relations with all the key players in the Middle East including Hamas and Israel, the latter of which it angered by hosting a Hamas delegation in Moscow in October. Some analysts have said the Gaza conflict has benefitted Russia by distracting world attention from the war in Ukraine and enabling Moscow to align itself with other developing countries in solidarity with the Palestinians. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a rare one-day lightning tour to the Middle East during which he visited Saudi Arabia after a short trip to the United Arab Emirates. Putin’s trip to the region is his first since July 2022, when he met Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Iran. The Russian leader has made few international trips after the International Criminal Court (ICC)issued an arrest warrant for himin March, accusing him of deporting Ukrainian children. Like North Korea, whose leader Kim Jong Un held a summit with Putin in Russia’s far east in September, Iran is an avowed enemy of the United States and has the capacity to provide Moscow with military hardware for its war in Ukraine, where Russia has made extensive use of Iranian drones. The US has voiced strong concern about the growingmilitary cooperationbetween Moscow and Tehran and warned that Iran may be preparing to provide Russia with advanced ballistic missiles for use in the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin last month said Russia and Iran were developing their relations, “including in the field of military-technical cooperation”, but declined to comment on the issue.  This is a modal window.

"How are Har­vard, Penn pres­i­dents re­spond­ing to cam­pus anti-Semi­tism row?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/how-are-harvard-penn-presidents-responding-to-campus-anti-semitism-row,"Harvard’s Claudine Gay and Elizabeth Magill at Penn released statements a day after their heated Congress hearing. The presidents ofHarvard Universityand the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) are responding to a backlash against their testimonies on campus anti-Semitism at the United States Congress. In a five-hour hearing on Monday, Harvard’s Claudine Gay and Penn’s Elizabeth Magill, joined by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) President Sally Kornbluth, testified on how their colleges are combatingcampus anti-Semitism– which observers say has been onthe risesince Hamas’s October 7 attack. The testimonies have made the presidents – particularly Gay and Magill – targets of criticism from supporters of Israel and Palestine alike, with some even calling for resignations or legal action. House members contested that under the guise of free speech protections guaranteed under the First Amendment of the US Constitution, anti-Semitic comments and behaviour have been enabled within their college communities. Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian students have pushed back, saying that calls for Palestinian liberation shouldnot be conflatedwith anti-Semitism. In a statement posted to X hours Wednesday night, Gay said that commitments to free expression do not entail condoning calls for violence or genocide. She added that “those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account”. Gay had also mentioned at the hearing that disciplinary action was under way against people who were possibly violating the university code of conduct – although the details of the cases and their political leanings were not shared.  In a video statement posted to X on Thursday morning, Magill promised to review Penn’s code of conduct after declining to say whether advocating genocide was a violation at the hearing. Magill said that at the time of the hearing, she was focused on longstanding values of free speech but that calls for genocide against Jewish people are “evil” and “threatening”. Magill said that she will convene with the university’s provost to re-evaluate the code of conduct in light of how solidarity groups and campus members have been addressing the Israel-Gaza war.  Gay and Magill’s statements have been labelled as too little, too late by some, who questioned why they did not clearly state these values at the Congress hearing. Students and alumni have also been calling on the two to resign, while a lawsuit has also been filed against Penn. An online petition that was launched prior to Magill’s statement and has more than 8,000 signatures, demands that Penn’s Board of Trustees force Magill to resign due to her “inability to unequivocally condemn calls for the genocide of Jewish students and inability to identify these as harassment”. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a nonvoting member of Penn’s Board of Trustees, also told reporters on Wednesday that the board would have a “serious decision” to make regarding Magill’sstatements. “They have seemingly failed every step of the way to take concrete action to make sure all students feel safe on campus,” said Shapiro. “And then the testimony yesterday took it to the next level.” On Tuesday, two Penn students also filed a federal lawsuit against the university accusing it of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and specific employees, including Magill, of being “responsible for the anti-Semitic abuse permeating the school”. Late on Wednesday, Harvard University’s Palestine Solidarity Committee released a joint statement with Penn’s Students Against Occupation and several other Jewish groups. The response said that the hearing distracted from the genocide in Gaza, and “real manifestations of anti-Jewish hatred” that the groups “vehemently oppose”, while alsojustifying anti-Palestinianracism. Pfizer CEO, Albert Bourla said he was “ashamed” to hear the testimonies in a post on X on Wednesday.    A post shared by Palestine Solidarity Committee (@harvardpsc) ",Published On 7 Dec 2023
Is­rael should face war crimes probe over jour­nal­ist death in Lebanon: NGOs,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/israel-likely-waged-deliberate-attack-on-journalists-watchdogs,"Rights groups say attack that killed Reuters journalist and injured six others ‘likely a direct attack on civilians’. International rights groups have said that Israeli strikes that killed a journalist and injured six others in southern Lebanon were likely a direct attack on civilians and must be investigated as a war crime. Separate investigations by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International determined that Israel’s military shot artillery shells at journalists near the border on October 13, in what appeared to be targeted attacks on civilians.

The group also called on Israel’s allies – the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany – to “suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel, given the risk they will be used for grave abuses”. Amnesty, in its ownreport, said the Israeli military strikes “were likely a direct attack on civilians that must be investigated as a war crime”. The group’s investigation indicated that the journalists were “well removed from ongoing hostilities, clearly identifiable as members of the media, and had been stationary for at least 75 minutes before they were hit”. “No journalist should ever be targeted or killed simply for carrying out their work. Israel must not be allowed to kill and attack journalists with impunity,” said Aya Majzoub, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. “Journalists are eyes and ears on the ground, they provide information and evidence that are vital for organisations like ours to see what crimes are being committed,” Majzoub told Al Jazeera. “It might be the case that the warring parties do not want journalists to be documenting their crimes,” she added. Journalists covering the Gaza war on the ground are facing unparalleled danger, according to the media rights group Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Since the Gaza warbroke out, at least 63 journalists have been killed, including 56 Palestinians, four Israelis, and three Lebanese nationals, according to the group. The war has also led to “the deadliest month for journalists” since CPJ began tracking data in 1992. Over 22 years, CPJ has documented at least 20 journalist killings by the Israeli army. No one has ever been charged or held responsible for these deaths. The organisation said the impunity in these cases has severely undermined the freedom of the press, leaving journalists vulnerable to attack. ",Published On 7 Dec 2023
Two months of Is­rael-Gaza war: How di­vid­ed is the world?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/two-months-of-israel-gaza-war-how-divided-is-the-world,"The war has cleaved the world between those calling for a ceasefire, those backing Israel and some sitting on the fence. Two months afterHamas attackedsouthern Israel on October 7, death and destruction have devastated the region between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Hamas fighters killed about 1,200 people and took 240 captive during their attack. Israel has responded with deadly bombardment and artillery assaults, including on the ground in Gaza, killing more than 16,000 people, at least 7,000 of them children. Attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the occupied West Bank have killed more than 200 other Palestinians and forced entire villages to decamp. Hospitals, schools and refugee camps have been targeted, with United Nations personnel and facilities also attacked by Israel at unprecedented rates. Against this backdrop, diplomatic clashes have also deepened. UN votes, public comments and major diplomatic steps over the past two months have underscored just how divisive the war has been for the world. Language has been a constant bone of contention between countries while talking about the war. The world has not agreed on whether to use the word“ceasefire” or “humanitarian pause”to describe the ending of violence and hostilities. While many countries advocate for a ceasefire, Israel’s allies call for a pause. According to the UN, a ceasefire is a “cessation of all acts of violence against the civilian population” while a humanitarian pause is a “temporary cessation of hostilities purely for humanitarian purposes”. A pause or truce is a temporary halt to fighting for a decided time frame. Al Jazeeraanalysedspeeches from world leaders at the UN and found that 55 percent of countries called for a “ceasefire” in Gaza. Some of these include Argentina, Belgium, China, Guayana, Turkey and Venezuela, among others. Another 23 percent of countries called for a “humanitarian pause”. These include Australia, Canada, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, among others. Other countries used terms alternative to pause such as “cessation”, “halt” or “respite”. The remaining 22 nations did not speak on this issue at the UN. Countries have also been indecisive on whether or not to call Israel an occupier, and on whether to talk about Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip and settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Of the countries analysed, 46 percent used the term “occupier” in reference to Israel or called the Palestinian territory “occupied”, whereas 54 percent did not. Only 23 percent of nations have referred toIsrael’s blockade of Gaza, using terms like “siege” or“open-air prison”and only 30 percent have talked aboutIsraeli settlements. The UN Security Council has voted on five resolutions throughoutthe warand failed to pass four due to the nations’ indecision and disagreement. Out of the 15 members, four voted against (France, Japan, the UK and the US) the first Russia-led draft on October 16. The main criticism it faced was that the draft didnot nameor condemn Hamas. This draft called for an immediate ceasefire. Brazil led the second draft on October 18. While it condemned Hamas and called for humanitarian pauses, garnering overwhelming votes in favour, the US vetoed the resolution. This was because the resolution did not mention Israel’s right of self-defence,saidUS ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Russia proposed another draft on October 25, calling for a humanitarian ceasefire and the release of captives held by Hamas. However, the resolution did not condemn Hamas. Only four members voted in favour. The UK said it wants the UNSC to work towards a “balanced text” and that the Russian draft failed to support Israel’s right to self-defence. The US also led a draft resolution on October 25, calling for a humanitarian pause instead of a ceasefire. Ten members voted in favour but permanent members Russia and Chinavetoedthe resolution. The UNSC finally adopted aMalta-led resolutioncalling for humanitarian pauses and aid delivery to Gaza on November 15. The US, UK and Russia abstained, with 12 nations voting in favour. Jordan led anon-binding resolutionat the UN General Assembly on October 27, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza alongside unhindered access to humanitarian aid in the besieged enclave, as well as for Israel to revoke its call for northern Gaza’s evacuation. As many as 120 countries, including France, voted in favour. Only 14 nations, including the US and Israel, voted against it, while 45 countries abstained. This resolution passed. The nations are not so divided on thetwo-state solutionas the means to attain peace in the region. A total of 95 percent of the countries have called for a two-state solution or an independent Palestinian state parallel to Israel. Only six countries have not called for it. During the war, several countries have completelycut ties with Israel. Belize,BoliviaandSouth Africahave suspended relations with Israel. Meanwhile, Bahrain, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Jordan, and Turkey have withdrawn their ambassadors. Some cities, such asBarcelonain Spain, have also suspended ties with Israel. The US has maintained itsstrong traditional supportfor Israel. Besides the US President Joe Biden’s firm diplomatic backing of Israel, the US also provides Israel with annual military support worth$3.8bn. The US House of Representativespasseda Republican plan providing $14.5bn in military aid for Israel on November 3. Acongressional resolutionon December 6 effectively dubbed anti-Zionism the same asanti-Semitism. Leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the UK have also joined the US in backing Israel.",Published On 7 Dec 2023
Is­rael’s war on Gaza: Can Guter­res’s use of UN’s Ar­ti­cle 99 bring peace?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/israels-war-on-gaza-can-guterress-use-of-uns-article-99-bring-peace,"The rarely used rule will allow the UN secretary-general to make an appeal for peace to the Security Council. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter, in a rare move on Wednesday aimed at formally warning the Security Council of the global threat from Israel’s war on Gaza. Guterres has been calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” since October 18. But the Security Council is yet to adopt a resolution calling for a ceasefire, amid differences between permanent members. The United States, Israel’s chief backer, has vetoed a resolution, while Russia, more critical of Israel, has blocked another one. But what is Article 99 and does it have any real power to stop this war? It’s a special power, and the only independent political tool given to the secretary-general in the UN Charter. It allows him to call a meeting of the Security Council on his own initiative to issue warnings about new threats to international peace and security and matters that are not yet on the council’s agenda. In Article 99, the charter states, “the Secretary General may bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security”. Now Guterres will have the right to speak at the Security Council, without having to be invited to speak by a member state, as is usually the case. In a letter to the Security Council released on Wednesday, Guterres said the Security Council’s continued lack of action and the sharp deterioration of the situation in Gaza had compelled him to invoke Article 99 for the first time since he took on the top job at the UN in 2017. At least 16,248 Palestinians in Gaza are dead and a further 7,600 missing. He warned public order in Gaza could soon break down amid the complete collapse of the humanitarian system, and that there was no effective protection of civilians and that “nowhere is safe in Gaza”. “The situation is fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region,” he wrote. Considered the UN’s most powerful body, the 15-member Security Council is tasked with maintaining international peace and security. If it chooses to act on Guterres’s advice and adopt a ceasefire resolution then yes. It will haveadditional powersat its disposal to ensure the resolution is implemented, including the power to impose sanctions or authorise the deployment of an international force. But it doesn’t give Guterres any powers to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution. Anthony Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera: “He can force a discussion, he can bring the parties together and encourage them to reach some kind of compromise. But because of the veto at the Security Council, the only way the Security Council can adopt a substantive resolution on this issue is for each of the five permanent members to choose not to veto it.” China, Russia, the US, the UK and France – hold this veto power. The USused their vetoon October 18 against a resolution that would have condemned Hamas’s attack on Israel while calling for a pause in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Twelve other council members voted in favour, while Russia and the UK abstained. It’s only been invoked four times in the past — in the Congo (1960), East Pakistan (1971), Iran (1979) and Lebanon (1989). The article was initially designed as a preventative tool, a bit like a warning system. Its use was meant to deter conflicts from escalating, but as in the war on Gaza, the article has also been used after conflicts had already escalated. “The fact that this tool has not been used since 1989 does resonate diplomatically and symbolically here in New York,” Daniel Forti, a senior analyst on UN advocacy and research at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera. The use of Article 99 has had mixed results in the past, though it has never really brought peace. That’s because the secretary-general’s intervention does not “fundamentally change the political calculation of the Security Council’s most powerful members”, Forti said. In 1960, for instance, the invocation of the article led to the Security Council adopting Resolution 143, calling for Belgium to begin troop withdrawal. It also sent UN peacekeeping forces to facilitate this. But the Congolese war continued, Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba was assassinated, and the country’s crisis would deepen in the years that followed. The Security Council similarly called for the release of American hostages in 1979, and Waldheim was authorised to “take all appropriate measures” to make that happen. But the hostages were held for 444 days, with two killed. The rest were released only after the Algiers Accords were signed in 1981. The Security Council also called on all sides in Lebanon to work towards a ceasefire in 1989, after Article 99 was last used. But the conflict continued. In the case of the current conflict, the US has so far firmly opposed a ceasefire resolution at the Security Council, and there is little evidence that Washington’s position has changed. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, did not welcome the move. In a post on X, Erdan described the letter as “more proof” of Guterres’s “moral distortion and his bias against Israel”. “The secretary-general’s call for a ceasefire is actually a call to keep Hamas’s reign of terror in Gaza,” said Erdan, who alsorepeated his callfor Guterres to resign.",Published On 7 Dec 2023
"Dis­place­ment, death, hunger as Is­rael’s war on Gaza en­ters third month",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/more-displacement-as-israeli-forces-press-deeper-into-south-gaza,"Fighting rages as Israeli troops press further south with ‘carpet bombardment of entire neighbourhoods’. Fighting has escalated in Gaza’s second-largest city ofKhan Younisas Israeli air strikes rain down throughout the enclave, forcing Palestinians to flee to increasingly crammed pockets of the territory’s southern edge where there is no promised security, as the war enters its third month. “We are talking about a carpet bombardment of entire neighbourhoods and residential blocks,” Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza, said on Thursday, following heavy overnight shelling there. The Israeli army “ordered with a threatening tone to move to Rafah because it is safe”, he said, but residential homes “were destroyed”. “[These strikes] are not concentrated in one area of Rafah … multiple locations were targeted, just sending waves of fear and concern that confirm what people have talked about and expressed before – there is literally no safe place in the Gaza Strip, including the areas Israel designated as safe.” After more than two months of war, starting on October 7, Mahmoud said that “the mood of these more than 60 days has been death, destruction and displacement”. “We’re talking about more than 60 days of constant movement and running for their lives from one place to another, from the extreme northern part of the Gazan city of Beit Hanoon to the extreme south by Rafah, where many people are being packed and squeezed.”  The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said that households in northern Gaza are “experiencing alarming levels of hunger”. At least 97 percent of households in northern Gaza have “inadequate food consumption”, with nine out of 10 people going one full day and night without food. In the southern governorates, a third of the households have reported high levels of severe or very severe hunger, with 53 percent experiencing moderate hunger. “Palestinians lack everything they need to survive,” Mahmoud said. While pursuing its offensive in the south, Israeli armed forces have attacked several refugee camps, among them the Jabalia camp in the north and the al-Maghazi camp in the centre. The attack in Jabaliakilled 22 relativesof Al Jazeera journalist Momin Alshrafi, including his father, mother, three siblings, and children. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, 60 percent of the wounded require urgent medical treatment abroad, pointing to the collapse of the health sector in Gaza. “The occupation forces are deliberately arresting and abusing the sick and wounded, including paramedics from our crews, and we are on the cusp of a health and environmental catastrophe in the Strip,” a statement said.

As the death toll mounts amid the humanitarian catastrophe, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told officials in Israel’s war cabinet last week that the administration of US President Joe Biden believed the war should end in weeks – not months, according to The Wall Street Journal, Israeli officials, in turn, expressed an interest in a return to normalcy, especially in the interest of economic stability, but did not make any guarantees, the report said. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel could indefinitely occupy part of the Gaza Strip to create a “buffer zone”, a move that would put him on a collision course with regional allies and the United States. Conflicting reports have also emerged on whether Israeli troops have surrounded the house of Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, in Khan Younis. Late on Wednesday, Netanyahu said it was “just a matter of time until we get him” and that Israeli soldiers had encircled his house. Yet, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari later said Sinwar’s home is the entire “Khan Younis area”, giving no indication that a specific location had been surrounded.

"‘No oth­er land is home’: Amid Is­rael bombs, a Gaza City fam­i­ly won’t leave",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/7/no-other-land-is-home-amid-israel-bombs-a-gaza-city-family-wont-leave,"Israel says it has given families a chance to flee Gaza City. But the Abu Shahla family won’t quit their city. Gaza City, Gaza —The Abu Shahla family stayed resolute in their house at the centre ofGaza Cityfor two weeks after the Israeli army launched its ground operations in the city. All the while through, their walls shook repeatedly and their hearts were filled with fear. Eventually, they had no choice but to leave what once was their decades-old home. “My grandparents were forced to flee their home and belongings in 1948,” said Amal, 24, referring to the forceddisplacement of 750,000 Palestiniansduring the creation of Israel, a period known as the Nakba or “catastrophe”.“And today we, the younger generations, are living a microcosm of their experience of forced displacement.” Recalling the horrific days that preceded the family’s evacuation of their house in October, Amal told Al Jazeera that knowing that it would likely be destroyed, and so she wouldn’t be able to return to it, meant losing “everything” to her. “It felt like recapping every day we have lived here, eaten with our friends, danced with our mom, slept with our babies, cried for a bad day, studied for a school quiz, innovated the kitchen and cooked our favourite dinner and everything erased. All together in seconds.” Still, the family refuses to leave Gaza City. Around 20 members of the family are living in Amal’s aunt’s one-bedroom apartment along with 15 other neighbours. Israeli tanks rule the streets of the besieged strip’s largest city. The Abu Shahla family can only move out when there’s no fighting around the house where they have taken refuge. They have little access to food and aid, including medical treatment. Yet, the family say that even if they were able to safely leave Gaza City, they wouldn’tgo to the southor anywhere else. Nowhere is safe in the whole Gaza Strip, with Israel bombing the southern city of Rafah and tanks bombarding Khan Younis, also in the south, they say. And even if it were, the fear of permanently getting displaced again — as their ancestors did in 1948 — is enough reason to “stay steadfast in our land and confront uprooting”, said Abu Rushdi, Amal’s 64-year-old grandfather. “We can build another house. We will do that. But we can’t have another land that we can call home,” he said. “We only have one, and that’s Palestine.” Still, the prospect of their home being demolished by Israeli bombing or bulldozers is one that brings “grief”, said Amal. “I wish that leaving home had meant losing only some walls that together make rooms and a property,” she said. “But it initiates a painful journey of further trauma, amounting the feeling of loss to every sense of familiarity and belonging in our own neighbourhood, our city, our homeland.” Her younger sister, Ruba, had just started work on her undergraduate research paper in the humanities this semester before the war began. “When we learned of Israeli tanks approaching our neighbourhood after we fled, we felt like someone has torn apart our identity cards and deemed us refugees, one more time after that of our grandparents in 1948,” Amal said. As winter creeps in, families across Gaza are more vulnerable than ever, especially with a weeklong truce that brought a temporary halt to fighting in late November now over. Yet Abu Rashdi, Amal’s grandfather, refuses to give up — and will not entertain the thought of leaving, even as Israeli authorities have tried to push the people of Gaza into a small patch of land in the south of the strip. He said his family was one of many in Palestine“insisting that we stay in our land, despite the fear all around us”. “They [Israel] have way more power and force to keep doing what they are doing to us, but we have all the right to live and enjoy the basics of a human life in Gaza and all of Palestine once this nightmare is over.”",Published On 7 Dec 2023

The fish­er­men of Jaf­fa: Fear re­places har­mo­ny amid Is­rael-Gaza war,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2023/12/7/the-fishermen-of-jaffa-fear-replaces-harmony-amid-israel-gaza-war," Jaffa, Israel- Johny Saba, an amiable 58-year-old fisherman, longs for life in the ancient Mediterranean port to return to how it was before the war. He hoists his young child up into his arms as a colleague repairs a rickety wooden fishing boat in the stillness of the evening. The shipyard is calm; only a handful of people come and go. Behind Johny, a tattooed, stocky, bald fisherman fixes a tangle of fishing net; he listens to no music, instead, free of distractions, he is lost in his thoughts as he methodically threads the meshed fabric through his hands. “Before the war, there was no problem here; Jews and [Palestinians] could work together,” Johny says before letting out a sigh. On the weekends, he says, thousands of people would come to buy fresh fish from local family businesses that had often existed for generations. He paints a picture of a community of fishermen - Christians, Jews and Muslims co-existing, working along the sun-drenched Mediterranean coast, bound together by the toil and experience of their trade rather than separated from one another by the tensions and divisions that existed between their communities. “Here we are all like brothers; If everywhere was like Jaffa, it would be paradise,” he reflects.",Published On 7 Dec 2023
Is­rael in­ten­si­fies dai­ly raids on oc­cu­pied West Bank,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/israel-intensifies-daily-raids-on-occupied-west-bank,"At least four Palestinians, including three teenagers, were killed in 24 hours, while 60 people were arrested. The Israeli army is intensifying its raids on the occupied West Bank, with near-daily incursions taking place across the territory. At least four Palestinians, including three teenagers, were killed in such attacks in the last 24 hours, Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford said, reporting from Ramallah late on Wednesday. Sixty Palestinians were arrested during that time, he said. The four killed included one 16-year-old in Jenin in the north of the West Bank, two brothers in Tubas, and one in Balata in Nablus, our correspondent said. Meanwhile, overnight in Tulkarem, a city in the north, an improvised explosive device went off while a convoy of armoured vehicles drove by. “We’re getting reports about a raid on the refugee camp in Tulkarem … It’s often described as a centre for the Palestinian armed resistance,” Stratford said. Several Palestinian workers from Gaza were detained overnight following an Israeli raid in the town of Faroun, near Tulkarem, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Sources from Tulkarem told Wafa that Israeli forces raided the city’s Kamal Salama building and took the workers from their residential apartments. Israeli forces also raided other areas including the Aida refugee camp south of Bethlehem; the villages and towns of Silat al-Dhahr, al-Atara, Arana, al-Jalama, Faqoua, al-Arqa, and Zububa in the Jenin governorate, and the village of Beit Dajan, east of Nablus.  Since October 7, the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli raids on the West Bank has risen to 266, with more than 3,640 people arrested. The West Bank has seen surging violence and arrests in parallel to Israel’s eight-week-old war on the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 16,248 Palestinians – including 7,112 children – there. Israel says it is targeting Hamas in Gaza, but the vast majority of casualties are civilians. Escalating violence in the West Bank is also taking place despite Hamas having no presence in that section of the occupied territories. Meanwhile, attacks by Israeli settlers are also on the rise in the West Bank. “Settler attacks in tandem with these raids means that millions of Palestinians across the occupied territories are facing terrifying pressures on a daily basis,” Stratford said. “The UN says these attacks have doubled since October 7, with at least 308 attacks recorded until about three days ago, and at least eight Palestinians killed in these settler attacks.” The United States on Tuesdayannounceda move to impose visa restrictions on “extremist” Israeli settlers involved in undermining peace, security or stability in the occupied West Bank. However, rights groups, Palestinians, and some in the international community are accusing Israel of not doing enough to stop settler violence.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Pho­tos: Gaza hu­man­i­tar­i­an con­di­tions near col­lapse as Is­raeli at­tacks widen,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/7/photos-humanitarian-conditions-in-gaza-worsen-as-israeli-offensive-widens,"In Pictures Israel’s widening air and ground offensive in southern Gaza has displaced tens of thousands more Palestinians and worsened the territory’s already dire humanitarian conditions, with the fighting preventing the distribution of food, water and medicine outside a sliver of southern Gaza and new military evacuation orders squeezing people into ever-smaller areas of the south. As the focus of the ground offensive moves down the Gaza Strip and into the second-largest city of Khan Younis, it is further shrinking the area where Palestinians can seek safety and pushing large numbers of people, many of whom have been forced to flee multiple times, towards the sealed-off border with Egypt. While Israeli forces ordered residents to evacuate Khan Younis, much of the city’s population remains in place, along with large numbers who were displaced from northern Gaza and are unable to leave or are wary of fleeing to the disastrously overcrowded far south. The United Nations says some 1.87 million people — more than 80 percent of the population of 2.3 million — have already fled their homes. Almost the entire population is now crowded into southern and central Gaza, dependent on aid. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that public order in Gaza could soon break down amid the complete collapse of the humanitarian system. “The situation is fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region. Such an outcome must be avoided at all costs.” Bushra Khalidi, a Ramallah-based legal expert and rights campaigner with international aid charity Oxfam, warned that Israel’s push to relocate Palestinians in Gaza to a small area in the south is making it impossible to deliver aid and driving up the risk of disease. “Squeezing people into a space that is basically as big as London’s Heathrow airport … is inhumane and makes it impossible to distribute aid to people,” Khalidi told Al Jazeera. “Gaza was already overpopulated … [now] we’re talking about 1.8 million people in an airport.” Khalidi added that cholera and gastroenteritis are rapidly spreading due to the congested conditions. Israel’s offensive has killed at least 16,248 Palestinians in Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200.",Published On 7 Dec 2023
"UN sec­re­tary-gen­er­al in­vokes Ar­ti­cle 99 on Gaza in rare, pow­er­ful move",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/un-secretary-general-invokes-article-99-on-gaza,"Antonio Guterres warned of a deepening ‘catastrophe’ in Gaza as he called on the Security Council to act. The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter, urging the UN Security Council to act on the war in Gaza. The rare move on Wednesday comes as the 15-member Security Council is yet to adopt a resolution calling for a ceasefire between Israel, Hamas and their allies. Article 99 allows the secretary-general to “bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security”. In his letter to the council’s president, Guterres invoked this responsibility, saying he believed the situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, “may aggravate existing threats to the maintenance of international peace and security”. Guterres – who has been calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”since October 18– also described “appalling human suffering, physical destruction and collective trauma across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories”. Article 99 is a special power – and the only independent political tool given to the secretary-general in the UN Charter – that allows him to call a meeting of the Security Council on his own initiative to issue warnings about new threats to international peace and security, and matters that are not yet on the council’s agenda. In response to Guterres’s letter, Security Council member the United Arab Emirates posted on X to say it had submitted a new draft resolution to the council, and “called for a humanitarian ceasefire resolution to be adopted urgently”. It warned that the situation in Gaza is catastrophic and close to irreversible, adding: “We cannot wait.”  If the council does choose to act on Guterres’s advice and adopt a ceasefire resolution, it does haveadditional powersat its disposal to ensure the resolution is implemented, including the power to impose sanctions or authorise the deployment of an international force. But the council’s five permanent members – China, Russia, the US, the UK and France – hold veto power. The USused that vetoon October 18 against a resolution that would have condemned Hamas’s attack on Israel while calling for a pause in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Twelve other council members voted in favour, while Russia and the UK abstained. Guterres said the Security Council’s continued lack of action and the sharp deterioration of the situation in Gaza had compelled him to invoke Article 99 for the first time since he took on the top job at the UN in 2017. He warned public order in Gaza could soon break down amid the complete collapse of the humanitarian system. “The situation is fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region,” he wrote. “Such an outcome must be avoided at all costs.”  But Guterres’s invocation of Article 99 was not welcomed by Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has denounced Israel’s “blatant aggression” on Gaza, saying that his country will not allow any attempt to “empty the population” of the besieged territory. In an interview with the US network NBC, Safadi said the war “is not going to bring security to Israel”. He also said that neither Jordan nor Egypt would accept the displacement of Palestinians from their own land or allow Israel “to proceed with its policies of transferring the crisis to the region”. “The right to self-defence does not mean a license to kill with impunity. It does not mean attacking a whole community,” said Safadi, adding that most of the Palestinians killed in the Israeli military invasion are children and women.  British newspaper The Times, citing the UK defence secretary, is reporting that a British team is currently in the occupied West Bank helping to prepare the PA to take control of Gaza. The report comes after Grant Shapps visited Ramallah. “One of the reasons we are going to Ramallah to talk to the Palestinian Authority is to understand their capacity and ability. One of the things we will be doing is talking to the British team who are helping to build that capacity, along with the Americans,” Shapps said. US officials have repeatedly said that the PA is the main candidate to succeed Hamas as the governing authority in Gaza after the war there ends. However, the Israeli prime minister rejected this possibility yesterday. “As long as I am the Prime Minister of Israel, this will not happen,” Netanyahu wrote on X. The anti-tank missile landed in the Shtula area of northern Israel, the military said. In a post on X, the Israeli army also said it attacked a series of Hezbollah-related targets in Lebanon. Ardi Imseis, an international law professor at Queen’s University in Canada, says UN political leaders are failing to identify what is happening on the ground in Gaza. And what is happening, Imseis told Al Jazeera, is the forcible transfer of 1.8 million people, the bombardment of “80 percent of the population”, and the use of starvation as a tool of war. “What’s worse is the Israeli leadership has been very clear on what they’re doing. They want at the very least to depopulate the Gaza Strip – that is, [that] all 2.3 million Palestinians should be leaving, in their view, to Egypt,” he said. It is vital that the UN speak out against the “ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip which we are watching in real-time”, he said, adding that based on evidence that exists, there is a “real and substantial possibility that genocide is also taking place”. Nihad Awad pointed to several recent incidents that have gained national attention, including the shooting of threePalestinian studentsin Burlington, Vermont, and thefatal stabbingof a Palestinian-American boy in Illinois. CAIR says it received 2,171 complaints in an “ongoing wave of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hate” in the country. In another incident, one woman who was carrying a Palestinian flag in DC was threatened with beheading, Awad told Al Jazeera, while cases of people being fired from their jobs for expressing pro-Palestinian sentiments have also been reported. “The 2,171 cases, these are not just numbers. Behind every number is a human being who suffered a hate crime or bias,” he said.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

Blinken spoke shortly after Reuters news agency reported that its journalist Issam Abdallah had been killed by Israeli tank fire in southern Lebanon on October 13. Following an investigation, Human Rights Watch said the killing appeared to be deliberate. “It is important and appropriate that it be fully and thoroughly investigated,” Blinken said. “My understanding is that Israel has initiated such an investigation, and it will be important to see that investigation come to a conclusion and to see the results of the investigation.” Sami Hermez of Northwestern University in Qatar tells Al Jazeera that Refaat Alareer was “someone who spoke to thousands”. Alareer, a poet, writer, professor and one of Gaza’s most prominent academics, was killed in Israeli army strikes on southern Gaza. “It’s hard when you have 17,000 people [dead], and we are unable to follow the stories of each and every one of them. This one touches me because I’m also a professor and writer just like Dr Refaat,” Hermez said. “It’s just unfathomable, horrific, brutal and so on, and we keep using these words, but nothing seems to capture it any more. I might as well just be silent.”  The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) says it received 2,171 complaints amid what it has described as an “ongoing wave of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hate” in the US. The complaints included violations of free speech, hate crimes and hate speech, bullying, and threats against employment, the organisation said. “Innocent Americans are suffering as a result of this rising tide of bigotry. Until our nation stops the violence in Gaza and rejects bigotry here in America, we fear that both Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism will continue to spin out of control,” CAIR wrote on X.

Is­raeli raid kills 22 mem­bers of Al Jazeera cor­re­spon­dent’s fam­i­ly in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/israeli-raid-kills-21-members-of-al-jazeera-correspondents-family-in-gaza,"The family members of Moamen Al Sharafi, a correspondent for Al Jazeera Arabic, have been killed at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. An Al Jazeera employee has lost 22 members of his family in an Israeli air attack on the home in which they were sheltering in the Gaza Strip. The family members of Moamen Al Sharafi, a correspondent for Al Jazeera Arabic, were killed early on Wednesday morning at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. Al Sharafi’s parents Mahmoud and Amina, his siblings and their spouses, as well as nephews and nieces were among those killed. Al Sharafi told Al Jazeera an explosive barrel hit the home, causing a deep crater in the ground. “None of the civil defence crews were able to reach their bodies,” he said. “We are prevented from saying goodbye to our loved ones and are deprived of giving them a proper burial.”  This is a modal window.

A video shot after the attack showed a relative of Al Sharafi wailing as he stood at the debris of the house that was bombed. “It looks like they hit the house at around 4 or 5 in the morning. We couldn’t reach the scene until the sun was up,” said the relative, adding that several children were killed. Al Sharafi, meanwhile, shared the contents of the last voice message his mother Amina sent to him before she was killed in the bombing. “Assalam Aalaykum. Good morning, Momin. How are you? I hope you are well. How are your wife and children? How is your health? Take care of yourself, son,” she is heard saying in the voice note. “May Allah bring you out of this war unharmed. Take good care of yourself. I really miss you, I pray for you every day. May God bless you.” In a statement, the Al Jazeera Media Network denounced the Israeli attack and said it “will pursue all legal steps to holding accountable all those responsible for this crime”. “The horrific event unfolded today [Wednesday] at Jabalia Camp, where Moamen’s family sought refuge, leading to the killing his father, mother, three siblings and his children,” said the network. “Al Jazeera calls on the international community and press freedom organisations to work to put an end to these massacres immediately and ensure prompt justice for the families of the martyrs and the innocent victims,” it added. On October 25, an Israeli raid killed several family members ofWael Dahdouh, another Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent in Gaza. Mohamed Abu Al-Qumsan, a broadcast engineer with Al Jazeera’s bureau in Gaza, alsolost 19 family members, including his father and two sisters, in Israeli air raids on the Jabalia refugee camp on October 31. At least 16,248 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Putin makes rare trip to Mid­dle East to meet with UAE and Sau­di lead­ers,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/putin-makes-rare-trip-to-middle-east-to-meet-with-uae-and-saudi-leaders,"The Russian leader has been bolstering his partnerships with Gulf nations as Moscow faces growing isolation by the West. Escorted by four fighter jets, Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a rare one-day lightning tour to the Middle East during which he visited Saudi Arabia after a short trip to the United Arab Emirates. Putin landed on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, which is hosting the United Nations COP28 climate talks. He was escorted to the presidential palace, where he was greeted with a 21-gun salute and a flyby of UAE military jets trailing smoke in the colours of the Russian flag. The Gulf nation’s President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan called Putin his “dear friend”. “I am happy to meet you again,” Sheikh Mohammed said. He later issued a statement saying they discussed “the importance of strengthening dialogue and cooperation to ensure stability and progress”. The Russian leader echoed those sentiments. “Our relations, largely due to your position, have reached an unprecedentedly high level,” Putin told Sheikh Mohammed. “The UAE is Russia’s main trading partner in the Arab world.”  This is a modal window.

The meeting was part of Russia’s quest to stake out a more influential role in the Middle East, with oil cooperation and the Israel-Hamas war on the agenda. The two leaders discussed, among other things, bilateral cooperation in the energy industry and advanced technologies, according to Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency. Putin then jetted off to Riyadh, where he met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud – their first face-to-face meeting since October 2019. In introductory remarks shown on Russian television, Putin thanked the crown prince for his invitation, saying he had originally expected MBS to visit Moscow, “but there were changes to plans”. Their next meeting should take place in Moscow, he said, adding: “Nothing can prevent the development of our friendly relations.” Putin’s meeting with the Saudi crown prince came after oil prices fell, despite a pledge by OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as allies led by Russia, to further reduce output. However, it was not immediately clear what Putin, who has rarely left Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, intended to raise specifically about oil or geopolitics with the crown prince of the world’s largest crude exporter. On Thursday, Putin will host the Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Moscow. Following that, the UAE will welcome Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday and Saturday. Putin’s rare trip to the region is his first since July 2022, when he met Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Iran. The Russian leader has made few international trips after the International Criminal Court (ICC)issued an arrest warrant for himin March, accusing him of deporting Ukrainian children. Neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia have signed the ICC’s founding treaty, and are not obligated to arrest him if he enters their territories. On Israel’s two-month bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, Putin has decried the war as a failure of the United States diplomacy. He has suggested Moscow could instead play the role of a mediator due to its friendly ties with both Israel and the Palestinians. Putin’s Middle East trip is also a part of his efforts to demonstrate that Western attempts to isolate Moscow throughsanctions for its war on Ukrainehave failed. “He seems to be pretty delighted to be on the ground in Abu Dhabi,” said James Bays, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor. It is unclear how this visit will be seen in Washington, as the UAE also has close ties with the US, he added.",Published On 6 Dec 2023
UN warns of ‘hor­ror’ and ‘atroc­i­ties’ as Is­rael steps up Gaza as­sault,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/un-warns-of-horror-and-atrocities-as-israel-steps-up-gaza-assault,"Officials call on Israel, Hamas, world powers to halt ‘apocalyptic’ scenes as Palestinians fruitlessly seek safety. UN officials have warned that the risk of “atrocities” is growing in Gaza, with Palestinians stuck in “deepening horror” as Israel intensifies its assault on the enclave. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Volker Türk, UN high commissioner for human rights, urged Israel, Hamas, and international actors with influence to prevent “atrocity crimes” as Israel’s advance into southern Gaza leaves displaced Palestinians withnowhere to run. “Palestinians in Gaza are living in utter deepening horror,” Türk continued, describing the displacement and the systemic deprivation of millions of Palestinians, who are surviving in unsafe, overcrowded and unsanitary conditions with no security. “My colleagues describe the situation as ‘apocalyptic’. In these circumstances, there is a heightened risk of atrocity crimes,” he stated. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) echoed his words, warning that the situation in Gaza is “getting worse each minute”. “Another wave of displacement is underway in Gaza”, UNRWA said in a post on X, labelling the enclave “one of the most dangerous places in the world”.   Speaking shortly before Human Rights Day on December 10, Türk noted that history has shown how a “cynical disregard” for human rights can lead to events that the world has declared should “never again” happen. It also risks resulting in impunity, he added, calling for all allegations of war-time crimes against civilians and hostages committed by Israel or Hamas to be investigated. Noting also the “alarming” escalation in “militarised violence” in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, Türk urged “the Israeli authorities [to] take immediate steps to end wide-spread impunity for such violations”. The UN official noted unlawful killings, aggressive settler violence, increases in arbitrary detentions, ill-treatment, sexual violence, and an alarming spike in deaths in custody of Palestinians. Allegations of sexual crimes committed by Hamas fighters during the October 7 attack on southern Israel must also be fully investigated “to ensure justice for the victims”, he continued. “Violence and vengeance will only lead to more violence,” he said. “The only solution is to end the occupation and achieve a two-state solution.” The International community must come together “with one voice”,  to demand a ceasefire immediately on humanitarian grounds. At least 16,248 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its retaliation to Hamas’s assault on southern Israel on October 7, according to authorities in the enclave. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted on December 10, 1948.

Why is Is­rael at war with the UN?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/why-is-israel-at-war-with-the-un,"Over the course of its war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel has repeatedly clashed with the United Nations. Israel on Wednesday announced its decision to revoke the residence visa of United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator Lynn Hastings on Wednesday. “Someone who did not condemn Hamas for the brutal massacre of 1,200 Israelis … but instead condemns Israel, a democratic country that protects its citizens, cannot serve in the UN and cannot enter Israel!” wrote Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen on X.  But the incident is only the latest in a series of instances of Israel clashing with the UN over the war in Gaza in ways that are uncommon for member states of the global body. Hastings said on Monday that “the conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist”. The UN official also warned that “If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond.” She was referring to the resumption of Israel’s bombardment on Gaza following the end of a temporary pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas. The Israeli response – to effectively put in motion the expulsion of Hastings from occupied Palestinian territories – marks the latest setback to its taut ties with the UN. On October 25, Israel’s ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan said that his countrywould refuse visasto UN officials after the body’s Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticised Israel for ordering civilians to evacuate from north to south Gaza. Guterres also saidHamas’s attack on Israelon October 7 did not happen “in a vacuum” as the Palestinians have been “subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation”. Earlier, on October 18, after thebombing of the AhliArab Hospital in Gaza, Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire in the region,condemningthecollective punishmentof Palestinians. Then, on November 14, Israel’s foreign minister Eli Cohen said that Guterres was not fit to lead the UN since he had not done enough to condemn Hamas. Israeli journalist Almog Boker alleged on November 29 that one of the captives released during the temporary pause was held by a teacher at a school run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The UNRWA released a statement on December 1, calling this allegationunsubstantiated. “UNRWA and other entities in the United Nations have asked the journalist to provide more information on what we consider to be a very serious allegation. Despite repeated demands, the journalist has not responded,” the statement said.  Israel’s aggression towards the UNRWA is not limited to allegations against its teachers. Several UNRWA schools have been targets of Israeli bombardment. On November 18, it was reported that at least 50 people were killed in anIsraeli attack on the Al Fakhoura school. On November 23, it was reported that 27 were killed inIsrael’s attack on the Abu Hussein school. At least 47 UNRWA buildings have been damaged throughout the war. UNRWA is currently hosting about 1.2 million civilians – two-thirds of all displaced people in Gaza – in its shelters across the north and south of the Strip. At least 130 UNRWA staff have been killed in Israeli bombings throughout the war. This is the highest number of UN personnel killed in a conflict in the history of the organisation. The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X on Monday saying the agency received a notification from the Israeli military to remove its medical supplies from southern Gaza within 24 hours. “We appeal to #Israel to withdraw the order, and take every possible measure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and humanitarian facilities,” he wrote.  Israel responded, denying that it had issued such a warning.“From a UN official we would expect, at least, to be more accurate,” COGAT, the Israeli body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs in Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank, posted on X. Ghebreyesus earlier criticised Israel’s proposal for a patch of land in the narrow coastalal-Mawasi townto be considered a safe zone in Gaza, calling it a recipe for disaster on November 17. The WHO chief said that the WHO would not participate in the establishment of any so-called “safe zone” in Gaza “without broad agreement, and unless fundamental conditions are in place to ensure safety and other essential needs are met, and a mechanism is in place to supervise its implementation”. Israel has repeatedly targeted Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, a trenchant critic of Israel’s policies. On December 4, after Albanese drew parallels between the dehumanisation of Jews ahead of the Holocaust and Israel’s war on Gaza, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy hit back. Levy accused Albanese of Holocaust inversion.  ",Published On 6 Dec 2023
"Two Gaza broth­ers stripped, jeered at by Is­raeli army, one tak­en cap­tive",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/6/losing-my-mind-israel-army-stripped-two-gaza-brothers-released-only-one,"Mohammed al-Saeedi, 18, who was detained with his older brother Khader, remains missing two months later. Deir el-Balah –Most of these days, Khader al-Saeedi wants to crawl out of his skin, tormented by the images of the last time he saw his brother, Mohammed. “I feel like I’m losing my mind,” Khader, a 21-year-old fisherman said. The two brothers were walking with their family along the so-called “safe passage” that Israeli forces told Palestinians in northern Gaza to take to flee south. But a short distance from Wadi Gaza, they found dozens of Israeli tanks flanking the Salah al-Din Road – Gaza’s main highway – with snipers standing on top. “You there! The one with the blue bag! Come here,” one of the soldiers shouted at Mohammed. The soldier then ordered Khader to do the same. Khader walked towards the soldiers, following his brother, raising his ID in one hand. “They told me to strip, so I took off my clothes,” Khader said. “They forced me to empty the bag of clothes that I was carrying, as well as the blue bag that Mohammed had. Then they ordered me to raise my arms, turn this way and that.” The soldiers told Mohammed, 18, to do the same. There was a third man who was also singled out from the crowd, and he too had to strip down to his underwear. “My brother wasn’t scared of the soldiers, which annoyed them a lot,” Khader said. “They snapped at the way he was walking, almost like he was sauntering, and said: ‘Do you think you are in your schoolyard? Come here.’” Mohammed was taken to the other side of the trench, hidden from view. The soldiers then told Khader to get dressed. “They told me I had 10 seconds to pack up the bags but I got nervous and said I don’t want the clothes any more,” Khader said. “One of the soldiers pointed his gun at me and pulled his finger on the trigger. I hurried to gather what I could in my arms and turned to join the rest of the moving crowd.” It was the last time he would see Mohammed. For half an hour, Khader walked in his underwear, until he caught up with his mother Ola, who had become faint with worry. Three days earlier, on Friday, October 13, Ola’s brother Izzat had visited their house in the Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City. A few hours after he left, Ola heard he had been killed in an Israeli air attack. “I spent four hours looking for his body at the morgue with my Mohammed,” Ola, 41, said. “We managed to bury him the next day.” That day, as relatives gathered in Ola’s house to pay their respects, the bombings around them grew more intense and closer. They decided to move to Ola’s brother-in-law’s apartment on the ground floor, But a few minutes later, the bombardment reached them. “I just remember something heavy falling on us,” Ola said. “It was chaos. I crawled on my hands and knees to get out, barefoot. I saw one of my sons Khader, and told him to find his siblings and get out.” Ola’s nephew Ali, Mohammed’s cousin and best friend, was killed. Her sister’s husband was brain dead and died in hospital a few hours later. Most of the block had been destroyed. The extended family – numbering more than 100 – spent that night at al-Shifa Hospital, sleeping first by the morgue. But when Israeli warplanes targeted the solar panels on the hospital’s rooftops, terrorising the tens of thousands of displaced families there, Ola’s husband decided to move south. “I didn’t want to leave, and neither did Mohammed, who wanted to stay in the hospital and volunteer as a medic,” Ola said. “But we had buried four members of my family in two days, and our home was destroyed.” The family, along with Ola’s elderly mother-in-law Aida, piled into their car and drove to get as close as possible to the “safe passage”. “Mohammed sat in my lap and I whispered to him not to be rash because he didn’t want to leave,” Ola said. “He smiled and replied: ‘As long as you’re okay I’ll be okay.'” They parked the car and joined the throngs on Salah al-Din Road, but immediately got separated, with Ola’s husband walking at his mother’s slow pace some distance behind them. The crowd kept moving, as Israeli soldiers would randomly order people to approach them and threatened everyone else to keep walking, their eyes straight ahead, or else. When the soldiers ordered her two sons to step towards them, Ola froze. Other people pushed past her, warning her to keep moving or otherwise risk getting shot at. One woman snapped at Ola that she was causing them harm. “I told them I can’t just go on when my two boys have been taken!” Ola said. “We had seen a man stripped to his underwear collecting his clothes and I thought that that’s what the Israelis would do to my sons, just to humiliate them. I didn’t know what to do, how is a mother supposed to act in this situation?” Ola and her daughters walked slowly, risking a furtive glance here and there. When Khader finally caught up with them, Ola wrapped him in one of his sister’s long coats. The third man who was detained with the brothers was released and found Khader, telling him not to worry and that after handcuffing, blindfolding and interrogating him, the soldiers said Mohammed would be released soon. “We waited on the road for an hour but there was no sign of him,” Khader said. It was at this point that his father and grandmother Aida caught up with them. When she found out what happened, the 70-year-old doubled back to where the Israeli tanks were stationed, and holding her white scarf in one hand, she sat down between two tanks and refused to budge until Mohammed was released. She screamed at the soldiers, cried and begged the soldiers to return her grandson. “She said she is not scared of being killed, even as people tried to get her to leave, saying she will be shot at,” Khader said. “After an hour, the snipers started shooting, forcing people to throw themselves on the ground.” Reluctantly, Aida began to walk again, going extra slow until the sun set. After walking for 12km (7.5 miles), the family arrived in Maghazi camp dazed, not quite believing what had happened. They called the Red Cross many times, giving their testimonies and Mohammed’s details. According to varioustestimoniesfrom displaced Palestinians who used the “safe passage”, hundreds of Palestinian men – and to a lesser extent some women and children – have been arrested at Israeli checkpoints, kidnapped and taken to unknown places. Last month, Palestinian poet Mosab Toha was among those fleeing northern Gaza and waskidnappedby Israeli forces. According to human rights lawyer Diana Buttu, Toha was taken to a prison in the Naqab (Negev) desert where he wasinterrogated and beatenalong with 200 men kidnapped from Gaza. Toha was released a day later. Hisham Mhanna, the spokesperson for the International Committee for the Red Cross, told Al Jazeera that the organisation receives a lot of phone calls from families informing them of their missing or detained relatives. “We take the information of the person detained, and we communicate with the Israeli side to see where they are held,” he said, not disclosing the number of calls received from people referring to the ‘safe passage’. “If we have any information from the Israeli side, we usually share that to the family directly, not to the media,” he added. “We think the soldiers took him to be tortured and used as a human shield,” Ola said, beginning to cry softly. “I wish we never left the hospital. I feel like I’ve handed over my son to the Israelis.” She took a deep breath. “Mohammed is brave,” she said. “Before we got displaced, he was always at the forefront of helping people in Shati, rescuing families under the rubble, and giving first aid to the injured.” The family are currently staying at a relative’s house in Deir el-Balah, and almost two months later, have no idea whether Mohammed is alive or dead. “I thought the soldiers wanted to search my boy, not to kidnap him,” Ola said. “I’m scared they killed him and left his body on the road, like the bodies of other people we saw. Dead horses, burned-out cars, suitcases and bags and money on the ground. No one could pick up anything or anyone on the ground otherwise they would be shot by the soldiers. Not knowing what happened to Mohammed is killing the family inside out. They no longer believe each other when they try to comfort themselves, saying he’ll be okay. “It’s not like when the Israelis kidnap the fishermen on a normal day and they get returned by the Red Cross after a few days,” Ola said. “I can’t sleep. I barely eat. How can I, if I don’t know whether my son is sleeping or eating or even alive?”",Published On 6 Dec 2023
How Is­rael is squeez­ing 1.8 mil­lion Pales­tini­ans into an air­port-sized area,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/how-israel-is-squeezing-1-8-million-palestinians-into-an-airport-sized-area,"Israel has declared an area smaller than Heathrow Airport as a safe space for Gaza’s displaced people to move to. The Israeli military has asked Palestinian residents of Gaza to evacuate to a part of the town ofal-Mawasiin the south of the besieged strip, designating it as a safe space. The directive comes at a time when Israel has stepped up its bombing of southern Gaza, especially around the city of Khan Younis, which the Israeli military claims is sheltering leaders of Hamas. But can the space declared “safe” by Israeli authorities actually accommodate the more than 1.8 million Palestinians who have been forced to evacuate their homes since the outbreak of violence onOctober 7? A coastal Bedouin town in the south of the Gaza Strip, al-Mawasi is small and narrow – about 1km (0.6 miles) wide and 14km (8.7 miles) long. It had been surrounded by Israelisettlementsuntil former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon disengaged settlements from Gaza in 2005. Israel has declared a mere 6.5sq km (2.5sq miles) of desolate, sandy terrain, within the city to be the humanitarian area where evacuees are supposed to seek shelter. That is an area half the size of London’s Heathrow Airport. About 61 million passengers passed through Heathrow in 2022, or about 167,000 a day on average. In other words, the population density in the “safe” part of al-Mawasi would be more than 20 times that of Heathrow — even if all of the airport’s daily passengers were present there at the same time.  Israel’s increasing bombardment of southern Gaza after the collapse of a truce hasthinnedfor safe zone options for Palestinians during the bloody war that has exceeded 60 days. Israel has deemed that Khan Younis, which was once rendered safe, is now a “dangerous combat zone”. While Israel has claimed there are safe zones for civilians in Gaza, residents have said no place is safe, and experts pointed out that spaces earmarked by Israel for people to evacuate to are too small or incapable of hosting large displaced populations. Ramallah-based legal expert Bushra Khalidi told Al Jazeera, “Gaza was already overpopulated … [now] we’re talking about 1.8 million people in an airport.” Khalidi added that cholera and gastroenteritis are rapidly spreading due to the congested conditions. “People are not getting better because conditions are not allowing them to get better,” she said. Khalidi is not the first to criticise Israel’s declaration of al-Mawasi as a safe space. World Health Organization (WHO) chiefTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuscalled the Israeli proposal a recipe for disaster on November 17. “Attempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services will significantly increase risks to health for people who are already on the brink,” he said, adding that the WHO will not participate in the establishment of any so-called “safe zone” in Gaza “without broad agreement, and unless fundamental conditions are in place to ensure safety and other essential needs are met, and a mechanism is in place to supervise its implementation”. A team from Sky News visited al-Mawasi to investigate the situation there. They found no shelter arrangements, such as agency tents or food kitchens. The area has already been facing a severe lack of healthcare facilities.",Published On 6 Dec 2023
"Is­rael army in most in­tense com­bat in Gaza war, no safe place to evac­u­ate",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/six-people-killed-in-strike-on-nuseirat-refugee-camp,"Heaviest fighting in two months of conflict with non-stop attacks in enclave’s south and central areas. The Israeli army has widened its attacks in southern and central Gaza, with some of the heaviest fighting in thewarseeing homes sheltering displaced Palestinians bombed, refugee camps hit and no safe place left to evacuate thousands of people already on the move for weeks. From early Wednesday morning, “under heavy aerial bombardment, Israeli tanks started pushing deeper and deeper to the centre ofKhan Youniscity, coming from the eastern side,” reported Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah, in southern Gaza, forcing hundreds of people to flee the area. “Everybody thought the eastern areas of Khan Younis were the main target, as the leaflets that were dropped on the residents stated, but it seems like the entire city of Khan Younis is under heavy bombardment right now,” Mahmoud said, of the leaflets dropped by Israeli forces ordering residents to evacuate. Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said that Israel’s military was gearing up for days of intense battle in Khan Younis, which it views as a key Hamas stronghold where many leaders could be stationed. However, Israel’s military must move cautiously as it believes numerous captives could also be there, said Fisher, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem. “It’s all part of a plan to move the operation further south,” he said. “We’re likely to see [the Israeli military’s] intense operation extend four or five weeks until the middle of January.” The next few days could bring the heaviest fighting of the two-month war, he added. Mahmoud said that “after this point, there are no options for Palestinians to go anywhere. The only option that might be feasible or even possible for Palestinians is crossing into Egypt, but with the current situation, it seems very, very difficult”. “Under heavy bombardment, people were being pushed first into the central part [of Gaza], then Khan Younis, and now Rafah,” he reported, adding that “more than 1.5 million people have been squeezed into this pocket of land that’s really populated with people”. There were also relentless assaults on Deir el-Balah in central Gaza through the night, reported Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary from the area. She said there were “non-stop explosions, non-stop artillery shelling and non-stop clashes. Multiple homes were bombed”. “The number of wounded being brought to the hospital is massive. Doctors and paramedics have not been able to save them all,” Khoudary said, describing the intensity of the attacks and noting that “it is very dangerous for people to leave for either the north or the south. At the same time, conditions here are very harsh. There is no food in the markets. Even the little food that was once available is not any more since the centre has been split off from the south.”  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

At least six people were killed and 14 wounded in an Israeli air strike on theNuseirat refugee campin central Gaza. An Al Jazeera team at the site of the strike reported on Wednesday that people were trapped under the rubble of a building that was hit. As the injured are rushed to the few remaining functional hospitals in the area, relief organizations sounded the alarm that supplies were perilously low. The international medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, warned thatAl-Aqsa Martyrs Hospitalin Deir el-Balah was running out of options. “There are 700 patients admitted in the hospital now, with new patients arriving all the time,” MSF emergency coordinator Marie-Aure Perreaut Revial said. “We are running out of essential supplies to treat them.” At least 16,248 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200. ",Published On 6 Dec 2023
US law­mak­ers lag vot­ers in sup­port for Gaza cease­fire,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/us-congress-support-for-gaza-ceasefire-lower-than-american-public,"A new poll says more than 60% US voters want ceasefire, while only 11% of lawmakers support an end to Israel’s war. Support among members of the United States Congress for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war is far lower than among voters. Data for Progress, a progressive US think tank,saidon Tuesday that 61 percent of likely US voters support calls for a permanent ceasefire and a de-escalation of violence in Israel’s war on the besieged Palestinian enclave, which has killed more than 16,000 people since October 7. Citing the poll in a post on social media platform X, Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib questioned why so few members of the government were aligned with the public’s views on this, noting that only 11 percent of Congress has called for a ceasefire. A full 76 percent of Democrat voters support a ceasefire.  Last week, Tlaib – the only Palestinian-American member of Congress whowas censuredby the US House of Representatives on November 7 – hit out at the White House for calling the few dozen lawmakers who demanded a ceasefire early in the war “repugnant”. The Data for Progress survey, which polled over 1,000 likely US voters in late November, said the majority of respondents were concerned about the rise in hate towards Jewish communities, Arabs and Muslims in the US since the start of the war. On Tuesday, the US House passed a measure equating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, a move Palestinian rights advocates denounced as“dangerous”, warning that it aims to curb free speech and distract from the war. When asked what the US government should prioritise in its foreign policy approach to the crisis, about half of the poll’s respondents mentioned diplomatic efforts, and some 30 percent mentioned humanitarian assistance. “Fewer than 1 in 4 voters (24%) choose ‘sending additional military aid and weapons to Israel’ — and only 11% choose ‘sending US troops to assist Israeli forces in Gaza’ as a priority,” Data for Progress noted. The US government providesbillionsin military support to Israel and has sent additional taxpayer money since the war began. However, the Biden administration on Tuesdayannounceda move to impose visa restrictions on “extremist” Israeli settlers involved in undermining peace, security or stability in the occupied West Bank. This represents a “shift in the stance” on the conflict, Youcef Bouandel, a professor of political science and international relations at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera. However, he added the move does not “go far enough”. Ariel Gold, the executive director of the US-based Fellowship of Reconciliation, told Al Jazeera the policy was “virtue signalling” as many settlers hold dual citizenship and do not require a visa to enter the US. Last month, a different poll byGallupfound that 45 percent of Americans disapproved of Israel’s military action in Gaza. It found that 63 percent of Democrats, 64 percent of people of colour, and 67 percent of young people aged 18-34 all opposed the war. Only 32 percent of Americans approved of President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas situation, Gallup said.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Pho­tos: West Bank fam­i­ly sees no hope of jus­tice in set­tler killings,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/6/west-bank-family-sees-no-hope-of-justice-in-settler-killings,"In Pictures Moussa is eight years old and really likes marbles. But for the past month, this Palestinian boy, living in the occupied West Bank, has a new game: “Pretend daddy isn’t dead.” He calls his dad, imagines what he did with his day, and acts like he is suddenly going to run into him. But his father, Bilal Saleh, was killed on October 28. The 40-year-old was shot in the chest while picking olives with his family near his home in the village of al-Issawiya. Saleh is one of more than 250 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank, according to a Palestinian government tally, since Hamas’s attack on October 7 sparked a new war with Israel. “He was a simple man, attached to his land,” says his widow, Ikhlas, showing images on her phone of Saleh in the fields, reciting the Quran with Moussa and at a wedding. She struggles to even look at them, let alone tell the story of what happened. The children pressed around her to fill in the details. Videos from the scene show four men wearing the knitted yarmulkes that are popular among Israeli settlers, shouting towards the family as they are harvesting. One is armed with an automatic rifle. The family flees, but Saleh has forgotten his phone and runs back to fetch it. A few minutes later, a gunshot rings out. The family rushes back to find Saleh bleeding from the chest. He was taken to a hospital about 10km (6 miles) away but declared dead soon after. The family says Ikhlas’s brother and father saw on social media that a man had been arrested for the shooting but released a few hours later. The police and COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body overseeing civilian activities in the Palestinian territories, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",Published On 6 Dec 2023
Is­raeli cap­tives’ fam­i­lies an­gry af­ter meet­ing with Ne­tanyahu,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/israeli-captives-families-angry-after-meeting-with-netanyahu,"Some accuse the government of a “farce” as they demand more action to secure the release of the 138 captives still held by Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met families of captives freed from Gaza in an encounter described as tense by the Israeli media. Tuesday’s meeting came amidintensified fightingin the besieged Gaza Strip following the end of a seven-day pause in hostilities that enabled the return of more than 100 captives, who had been taken by the Palestinian armed group Hamas during its October 7 attack on Israel, in exchange for some 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Israel said on Tuesday that some138 captivesremained in the territory. Several of the relatives who attended the meeting left bitterly critical of the government. Dani Miran, whose son Omri was among those taken captive, said he was so disgusted he had walked out in the middle of the meeting. “I won’t go into the details of what was discussed but this entire performance was ugly, insulting, messy,” he told Israel’s Channel 13, saying the government had made a “farce” out of the issue. “They say, ‘We’ve done this, we’ve done that’. [Hamas’ Gaza leader Yahya] Sinwar is the one who returned our people, not them. It angers me that they say that they dictated things. They hadn’t dictated a single move.” Israel says several women and children remain in Hamas’s hands, while families with adult male relatives in captivity have been calling for them not to be forgotten. “It was a very turbulent meeting, many people yelling,” said Jennifer Master, whose partner Andrey is still being held by Hamas. “We are all trying to make sure our loved ones get home. There are those who want the women who are left or the children who are left, and those who say we want the men,” Master told Israel’s Channel 12. Family members called for immediate action to secure the release of the remaining captives. “I asked Netanyahu if the primary objective of the war was to bring back the hostages,” Meirav Leshem Gonen, mother of 23-year-old hostage Romi Gonen, told Israeli television after the meeting. “He answered me directly: ‘Yes’,” she said. “I am happy with his answer, but only reality counts.”  This is a modal window.

Leshem Gonen said she was concerned that captives were being “severely mistreated — women, young girls, and men too”. Speaking at a news conference afterwards, Netanyahu said he had heard stories that “broke my heart” and included thirst and hunger, as well as physical and mental abuse. “I heard and you also heard, about sexual assault and cases of brutal rape unlike anything,” he added. Israel has said it is investigating several cases of alleged sexual assault and rape committed by Hamas fighters during their October 7 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed. Witnesses and medical experts have said some fighters committed rape and other attacks before killing the victims, although the extent of the sexual violence remains unknown. Hamas has denied carrying out such assaults. Israel began an intense bombardment of Gaza in the wake of Hamas’s attack, saying it wanted to destroy the group and free the captives. The attacks have killed more than 16,200 people in Gaza, according to Hamas, which has controlled the territory since 2006. Some families, meanwhile, appeared to be losing patience with Netanyahu’s government. “We have faith in our children, that they are strong and they will overcome this, and we want our government and the military to do what they do as fast as they can — as fast as possible — to start the negotiations,” said Idit Ohel, the mother of 21-year-old hostage Alon, during an online panel organised by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. “Sixty days is too much,” she said, her voice rising. “I don’t want 61 days, I don’t want 65 days. I want them back now.” Israel withdrew its negotiators from Qatar on December 2, blaming an “impasse” after failing to make progress in talks aimed at securing a renewed pause in hostilities. Afterwards, Hamas said it would not release any more captives until the war in Gaza was ended.",Published On 6 Dec 2023
"‘Anti-Zion­ism is an­ti­semitism,’ US House as­serts in ‘dan­ger­ous’ res­o­lu­tion",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/anti-zionism-is-antisemitism-us-house-asserts-in-dangerous-resolution,"Palestinian rights advocates denounce a Republican-led measure as a push to smear Israel’s critics amid the war in Gaza. Washington, DC –Palestinian rights advocates are denouncing a congressional resolution that equates anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, calling it a “dangerous” measure that aims to curb free speech and distract from thewar in Gaza. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed themeasureon Tuesday in a 311-14 vote, with 92 Democratic members abstaining by voting “present”. The symbolic resolution was framed as an effort to reject the “drastic rise of anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world”. But it contained language saying that the House “clearly and firmly states that anti-Zionism is antisemitism”. It also condemned the slogan “From the River to the Sea”, which rights advocates understand to be an aspirationalcall for equalityin historic Palestine. Instead, the resolution described it as a “rallying cry for the eradication of the State of Israel and the Jewish people”. It also characterised demonstrators whogathered in Washington, DC,last month to demand a ceasefire as “rioters”. They “spewed hateful and vile language amplifying antisemitic themes”, the resolution alleges. Husam Marajda, an organiser with the US Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), said the resolution is an effort to “cancel” Palestinian rights advocates by accusing them of bigotry and labelling their criticism of Israeli policies as hate speech. “It’s super dangerous. It sets a really, really bad precedent. It’s aiming to criminalise our liberation struggle and our call for justice and peace and equality,” Marajda told Al Jazeera.  This is a modal window.

It contends that the Jewish people have a right to self-determination in historic Palestine, which Zionists view as their ancestral homeland. The rise of Zionism in the late 1800s was partly in response to anti-Semitism in Europe. But many Palestinians reject Zionism as a driver of the settler colonialism that dispossessed them during the founding of Israel. Israel’s establishment coincided with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who were forcibly driven from their homes in what is knownas the Nakba, the Arabic word for “catastrophe”. While Palestinians view themselves as the native people of the land, Zionists say Jewish people have historic and biblical claims to what is today Israel. Some hardline Zionists, including members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, argue that the present-day Palestinian territories — the West Bank and Gaza — also belong to Israel. At a United Nations General Assembly speech in November, Netanyahuheld up a mapof Israel that showed the country stretching from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, encompassing the West Bank, Gaza and Syria’s Golan Heights. Some Palestinians also blame Zionism for Israeli abuses against them, whichamount to apartheid, according to leading human rights groups like Amnesty International. In the US, Palestinian rights supporters have long rejected conflations of Zionism with Judaism, noting that many Jewish Americans identify as anti-Zionist. “Opposing the policies of the government of Israel and Netanyahu’s extremism is not antisemitic. Speaking up for human rights and a ceasefire to save lives should never be condemned,” Palestinian American Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib said in a social media post on Tuesday, explaining her vote against the resolution.

Marajda stressed that Palestinians have a right to oppose Zionism, a position he said has nothing to do with prejudice. “This resolution is saying that if you’re critical ofthis Israeli government, essentially you hate Jewish people,” he said. “I didn’t choose — the Palestinians didn’t choose — their occupiers.” The resolution is one of several pro-Israel motions approved by Congress since October 7. Most US legislators have expressed unwavering support for Israel amid its offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 16,000 Palestinians. Yasmine Taeb, the legislative and political director at MPower Change, a Muslim American advocacy group, called the resolution “extremely dangerous”. “It unequivocally equates any criticism of the Israeli government with anti-Semitism. Essentially it smears millions and millions of people demonstrating globally in support of alasting ceasefire, including Jewish-American organisations,” Taeb told Al Jazeera. The advocacy group Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) was also quick to denounce the congressional measure. “Falsely stating that anti-Zionism is antisemitism conflates all Jews with the Israeli state and endangers our communities. It fuels deadly violence and censorship campaigns against Palestinians,” JVP Action said in a social media post. “We are proud anti-Zionists Jews. We refuse to pit communities against one another.”  All House Republicans but one — Congressman Thomas Massie — voted in favour of the resolution. ButDemocrats weresplit on the measure: 13 voted against it and 95 for it, on top of the 92 who abstained with a “present” vote. Jerrold Nadler, a key Jewish House Democrat, had decried the resolution on Monday, noting that some Jewish communities oppose Zionism for religious reasons and should not be branded as anti-Semitic. “While most anti-Zionism is indeed anti-Semitic, the authors, if they were at all familiar with Jewish history and culture, should know about Jewish anti-Zionism that was, and is, expressly not anti-Semitic,” he said. Nadler accused Republicans of using support for Israel to advance “partisan wedging at the expense of the Jewish community”. Still, he did not vote against the resolution on Tuesday. He opted for “present”. The vote highlighted the divisions among the Democrats over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. While the party’sprogressive winghas pressed for a ceasefire, President Joe Biden and the majority of congressional Democrats have avoided such calls. But that could signal a disconnect from the party base. AReuters/Ipsos pollin November indicated 62 percent of Democratic voters considered Israel’s response “excessive”. Two in three survey respondents backed a ceasefire.  Republicans, meanwhile, have led motions that critics say are designed to bring the Democratic schism to the fore. Last month, for instance, they moved to censureCongresswoman Tlaib, the only Palestinian in the House, over her comments on the Gaza war. Conservatives have accused Democrats who vote against such measures of being anti-Israel, if not anti-Semitic. That creates a political dilemma for Democratic lawmakers. If they support the bills, they risk upsetting large segments of their base, but if they oppose them, they open themselves to Republican attacks. Taeb said the lawmakers who voted “present” did not want to go on the record as equating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism, but at the same time, they wanted to be seen as countering anti-Semitism. “It’s just politics,” she told Al Jazeera.  Tuesday’s resolution was co-sponsored by CongressmanMax Miller, who has faced outrage in recent weeks for saying, “We’re going to turn [Palestine] into a parking lot.” Taeb said the fact that lawmakers who have promoted anti-Palestinian hate are championing such resolutions shows that Tuesday’s measure is not about combating prejudice. “The intent of these members is to smear and silence peace activists calling to end the massacre of Palestinian children and families.”",Published On 6 Dec 2023

Here’s a recap of today’s main developments: In universities across the world, the definition of anti-Semitism put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) has been used to silence critical commentary on Israel’s human rights violations and war crimes. In Australia, the definition has been having a chilling effect on campuses across the country. Amid Israel’s relentless bombing of Gaza, which has killed nearly 16,000 people, including more than 6,000 children, students and staff who have organised in solidarity with the Palestinian people have faced pressure and intimidation. Read more about the situation in thisopinion piece. Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem After a delay of several hours, the [Israeli] security cabinet met and approved the war cabinet’s recommendation to allow fuel into the Gaza Strip. But it didn’t come without any opposition. Two ultranationalists, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the country’s national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, the country’s finance minister, were against this move, saying that Israel is now changing its red lines and that they are afraid this fuel will go into the hands of Hamas. During the ceasefire period, there were 60,000 litres of fuel allowed into the Gaza Strip per day. The number will now be 120,000 – double that amount. Although it is still short of the amount that came at the request of the Americans, which is 180,000 litres per day. The Israeli government and army alike are saying that this fuel will be used for hospitals, for water pumps and for desalination plants so that the spread of disease will not happen in the Gaza Strip because it could impact Israel’s military operation. However, we do know that disease has already spread in the Gaza Strip. “Peace be upon you, good morning Momin. How are you? Hope you are well.” These are some of the last words Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Momin Alshrafi heard from his mother, Amina, who was killed in an Israeli attack on Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp alongside 21 other members of their family.

James Elder, spokesman for the UN’s child relief agency, says that so-called safe zones in Gaza risk crowding thousands of people in inhumane conditions. The Israeli military said on X on Monday that it wasdefining “safe areas”for civilians, but Al Jazeera correspondents and people on the ground say it is difficult to heed these orders. Safe zones “risk being zones of disease and human suffering”, Elder said in an audio message posted to his X account. “Currently in a shelter in Gaza, there’s around one toilet for 400 families. In these safe zones, there’ll be no toilet, and it’s tens of thousands of people,” he said. “For safe zones to be safe, they must, by law, have water, food, medical supplies and shelter.” Elder stressed that for safe zones to provide protection, people need to be able to safely get to them. Throughout its war on Gaza, the Israeli army has repeatedly instructed Palestinians to evacuate to various areas of the Strip for their safety, only to later bomb those areas as well as evacuation routes. “Only a ceasefire can save the children of Gaza,” he said. No water. No sanitation. No food. Just bombs.#Gazapic.twitter.com/uffX8iM53r — James Elder (@1james_elder)December 6, 2023  Israeli authorities have approved the construction of more than 1,700 new homes, a nongovernmental organisation says. Half the “new neighbourhood” comprising 1,738 housing units will be in the city’s annexed east, the Israeli NGO Peace Now said. “If it weren’t for the [Gaza] war, there would be a lot of noise. It’s a highly problematic project for the continuity of a Palestinian state between the southern West Bank and East Jerusalem,” Peace Now’s Hagit Ofran told the AFP news agency. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday the plan by Israel is to “flood Jerusalem with settlements and settlers” and “separate it from its Palestinian surroundings”. Israeli settlements in occupied territories are illegal under international law. In 2016, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution condemning Israeli settlement building, saying it has “no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law”. We’re getting reports of Israeli military raids in the occupied West Bank. Footage verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad unit showed Israeli forces storming the town of Beita, south of Nablus. The army also raided Nur Shams refugee camp, east of Tulkarem. Israeli forces were seen in the vicinity of Thabet Thabet Hospital in Tulkarem, as well. Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Health Ministry in Gaza, says he has just lost a number of his relatives in an Israeli army attack. “The Israeli occupation wants to kill hope, it wants to kill our youths, our children, and women,” he told the Palestinian news agency Shehab. Israeli forces “do not differentiate between a child and the elderly”. Al-Bursh said 70 percent of those who lost their lives are women and children. “Today, those wounded in Gaza die of bleeding … We cannot do anything for them,” he said. “They [Israeli forces] emptied hospitals of their supplies and left them as morgues to large numbers of bodies. All we do is count bodies.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’s decision to use his most powerful diplomatic tool is a clear indication of the “urgency of the matter” in Gaza, Anthony Arend of Georgetown University tells Al Jazeera. The rare move is “a very important action … to force a discussion” on the war in the Security Council, the university’s department of government chair said. Arend acknowledged that even with the decision, Guterres still “cannot force the Security Council to adopt a resolution”. “He can force a discussion, he can bring the parties together and encourage them to reach some kind of compromise. But because of the veto at the Security Council, the only way the Security Council can adopt a substantive resolution on this issue is for each of the five permanent members to choose not to veto it.” He also conceded that it would be “very, very challenging” for the permanent members US, Russia, China, France and the UK to agree on a resolution. “At the very least, the secretary-general would be able to bring up issues, present information, present data that needs to be presented, not just to the Security Council, but to the world as a whole,” Arend added.

US an­nounces visa bans af­ter warn­ing Is­rael on West Bank set­tler vi­o­lence,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/us-announces-visa-bans-after-warning-israel-on-west-bank-settler-violence,"US has called on Israel to act against violent settler groups in the occupied West Bank. The US Department of State has said that it will impose visa restrictions on Israeli settlers involved in undermining peace, security or stability in the occupied West Bank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the move on Tuesday, one day after the State Department said that Israel has not taken sufficient steps to addresssettler attacksthat have driven many Palestiniansoff their land. “Today, the State Department is implementing a new visa restriction policy targeting individuals believed to have been involved in undermining peace, security or stability in the West Bank, including through committing acts of violence or taking other actions that unduly restrict civilians’ access to essential services and basic necessities,” Blinken said. President Joe Biden and other senior US officials have warned repeatedly that Israel must act to stop violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, which has increased since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. “We have underscored to the Israeli government the need to do more to hold accountable extremist settlers who have committed violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank,” Blinken said. Blinken did not announce individual visa bans, but department spokesman Matthew Miller said the bans would be implemented starting Tuesday and would cover “dozens” of settlers and their families, with more to come. He did not give a number and didn’t identify any of those targeted due to confidentiality reasons. Israeli settler violence has long targeted Palestinian communities in the West Bank, and the attacks have surged over the last year, as Israel’s far-right government, which itself includes ultranationalist settlers,signals support. Today, I announced a new visa restrictions policy targeting individuals and their family members involved in or meaningfully contributing to actions that undermine peace, security, and stability in the West Bank. Violence against  civilians will have consequences. — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken)December 5, 2023  Settler attacks have escalated further amid the continuing war in Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas, which launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7 that killed approximately 1,200 people and took roughly240 others hostage. After the attack, Israel launched a devastating assault on Gaza which has killed more than 16,200 people and displaced more than 1.5 million others, according to Palestinian officials. Since the October 7 attack, Israeli settlers have killed at least nine Palestinians in the West Bank, three times as many as in all of 2022, andattackson Palestinian villages and farmers have become commonplace. While Palestinian attacks on Israeli settlers and soldiers in the West Bank typically meet harsh reprisals by Israeli forces, accountability for attacks byIsraeli settlerson Palestinians, which often take place under the gaze of Israeli soldiers, is exceedingly rare. Palestinians have described settler violence as one part of a larger Israeli effort to force them from their land. In 2018, Israel passed a controversial bill known as thenation-state lawthat, among other things, called Jewish settlement efforts a “national value” that the state would “encourage and promote”.

Search­ing for sur­vivors af­ter Is­raeli at­tack on cen­tral Gaza build­ing,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/5/searching-for-survivors-after-israeli-attack-on-central-gaza-building,"In Pictures Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip –Israeli forces continue to pound the Gaza Strip on the 60th day of its war on the besieged coastal enclave. The sky in the town of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza is grey with the aftermath of relentless Israeli ground attacks and aerial bombardment. A fire breaks out in the middle of the street, littered with rubble. But that does not deter dozens of people from gathering at the site of a bombed building. The crowd of men are attempting to rescue the survivors and retrieve the bodies of those killed in the three-storey Abu Musbih building bombed by Israel. “We need stretchers,” shouts a man. “Someone, find us stretchers.” Near him lies the lifeless body of a man, almost entirely covered by debris. He is pulled out by three men and taken on blankets being used as stretchers. The attack on Tuesday afternoon struck the building when about 150 people were inside, most of them displaced families from other parts of Gaza. According to Gaza’s health ministry, 45 people have been killed and at least 50 others wounded. Some of the dead remain buried under the rubble. The injured were transported in civilian cars, tuk-tuks and ambulances to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Meanwhile, a representative of the World Health Organization in the Palestinian Territories said the situation in Gaza is “getting worse every hour” as Israel intensifies its bombing of the enclave’s southern areas. “I want to make clear that we are facing a growing humanitarian catastrophe,” Rik Peeperkorn said. More than 16,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza by Israeli forces since October 7 and about 42,000 others wounded.",Published On 5 Dec 2023
Is­raeli army sur­rounds Khan You­nis as south­ern Gaza at­tacks in­ten­si­fy,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/israeli-army-surrounds-khan-younis-as-southern-gaza-attacks-intensify,"Israel is intensifying its attacks in and around Gaza’s second-largest city as the United Nations expects one million to flee to Rafah in the coming days. Israeli forces are surrounding the city of Khan Younis, Israel’s top military commander has said, as the ground offensive spreads to the south of the Gaza Strip. “Sixty days after the war began our forces are now encircling the Khan Younis area in the southern Gaza Strip,” said Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, the Israeli army’s chief of general staff, on Tuesday. “We have secured many Hamas strongholds in the northern Gaza Strip, and now we are operating against its strongholds in the south,” Halevi said, according to the Times of Israel newspaper, as he announced the next phase of Israel’s ground offensive against the Palestinian group. “Anyone who thought that the IDF [Israeli army] would not know how to resume the fighting after the truce was mistaken,” he added of thepause in hostilitiesthat collapsed on Friday, and that enabled the exchange of captives held in Gaza for Palestinians in Israeli jails. Hamas’s Osama Hamdan said there would be “no negotiations or a [prisoner] swap” before the Israeli assault comes to an end. Speaking to reporters in Beirut, Hamdan also said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “responsible” for the lives of Israeli captives in Gaza, adding that his trueobjective is to “eliminate the Palestinian people”. The Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s armed wing, said it had engaged in fighting against the Israeli army in all areas of the Strip since Tuesday morning. A statement on the group’s Telegram channel claimed it totally or partially destroyed 24 army vehicles in Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city. It added its snipers killed and wounded eight Israeli soldiers.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

More than one million Palestinians have been displaced from northern Gaza since October 13, when the Israeli military ordered residents there to evacuate to the south on 24 hours’ notice. After the weeklong truce expired, the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of Palestinians from southern Gaza. Families in Khan Younis were packing up again and heading further south to Rafah, a town on the Egyptian border. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Rafah, said the tight pocket of land was already crammed with people camping out in the open and lacking basic services including water and sanitation. “Rafah is now the last shelter left for Palestinians, [but] the bombardment continues also in this area,” he said. Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative for the occupied Palestinian territories, told reporters via video link from Gaza that “the situation is getting worse by the hour”. “There’s intensified bombing going on all around, including here in the southern areas, Khan Younis and even in Rafah,” Peeperkorn said. WHO has repeatedly warned that the spread of disease could be even deadlier than air strikes. While disease surveillance systems are hampered, the UN agency has noted increases in infectious diseases, including acute respiratory infections, scabies and diarrhoea. Thomas White, director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza, said the agency was “not able to provide for more internally displaced people (IDPs)”. “Rafah normally has a population of 280,000 and already hosting around 470,000 IDPs will not cope with a doubling of its IDP population,” White said. Adnan Abu Hasna, a UNRWA representative, said the agency was expecting more than one million people to arrive in Gaza’s southernmost city in the coming days. “We have tens of thousands of families in the streets. They are already [sheltering] under random things – pieces of nylon and wood. It’s raining now. We will see the disaster,” he said, adding about 50 to 70 aid trucks entering Gaza daily via the Rafah border did not come close to meeting the needs of those displaced. At the 44th summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which commenced on Tuesday in the Qatari capital Doha, Qatar’s emir said the deaths of innocent Palestinians in Gaza amounted to a “genocide committed by Israel”. “It is a disgrace upon the international community to allow this heinous crime to continue … with systemic and purposeful killing of innocent unarmed civilians,” Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said in his opening remarks. Local residents in the north of Gaza, where a ground invasion began over a month ago amid a relentless air offensive, also described harrowing conditions. Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Health Ministry in Gaza, spoke to Al Jazeera from inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital, which hosts thousands of refugees looking for safety. “The Israeli occupation forces have laid siege to the facility from all sides. Patients and those who took shelter here are gripped with fear and overwhelmed by horror,” he said. “The Israeli forces are attacking with the aim of forcibly removing all those inside the hospital. These are patients, victims and displaced civilians.” WHO recorded 203 attacks on healthcare facilities from October 7 to November 28, a number it described as “unprecedented.”   This is a modal window.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, staking out a more influential role in the Middle East, will visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, and host Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Moscow the following day. The talks will focus on bilateral relations and theIsrael-Hamas war,Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. Peskov said that discussions on oil market cooperation will be on the agenda of talks, as Moscow cooperates with all three countries through OPEC+, which is comprised of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia. “These discussions are held within the OPEC+ format, but of course, cooperation in this area is always on the agenda,” said Peskov. The OPEC+ group, which Putin helped create in 2016, announcednew voluntary supply cutslast week, which met scepticism from the oil market.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Separately, Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said that Saudi-Russian cooperation within the oil cooperation body was “fruitful”. “Fairly close Russian-Saudi coordination in this format is a reliable guarantee of maintaining a stable and predictable situation in the global oil market,” Ushakov said, according to Russian news agencies. Putin’s drive to bolster its ties with Gulf and other Middle Eastern states is part of his efforts to demonstrate that Western attempts to isolate Moscow throughsanctions for its war on Ukrainehave failed. The Russian leader has not made many international trips after the International Criminal Court (ICC)issued an arrest warrant for himin March, accusing Putin of deporting Ukrainian children. Neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia have signed the ICC’s founding treaty, meaning they would not have to arrest him if he entered their territories. With regards to Israel’s current bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s October 7 attacks, Putin has sought to cast the war as a failure of U.S. diplomacy, charging that Washington had opted for economic “handouts” to the Palestinians and abandoned efforts to help create a Palestinian state. He has suggested Moscow could play the role of mediator, thanks to its friendly ties with both Israel and the Palestinians, saying that “no one could suspect us of playing up to one party.”",Published On 5 Dec 2023
"US sales of Pales­tin­ian kef­fiyehs soar, even as wear­ers tar­get­ed",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/us-sales-of-palestinian-keffiyehs-soar-even-as-wearers-targeted,"An uptick of keffiyeh sales points to a growing trend of pro-Palestinian solidarity in the United States. A growing number of Americans are donningthe keffiyeh, the distinctive patterned scarf that’s closely linked with Palestinians, to demand a ceasefire to Israel’s attacks on Gaza or to signal their support for Palestinians. Sales of the scarves have jumped since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, US distributors say, even as keffiyehs have been forcibly removed by security forces at some protests and wearers report being targeted for verbal and physical abuse. “It was like a light switch. All of a sudden, we had hundreds of people on the website simultaneously and buying whatever they could,” said Azar Aghayev, the US distributor for Hirbawi, which opened in 1961 and is the only manufacturer of keffiyehs left in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. “In two days, the stock that we had was just gone, and not just gone, it was oversold.” Hirbawi, which has patented its brand, sells scarves internationally via its US and German websites and on Amazon. All 40 variations on the US website, which include many in bright colours as well as the traditional black and white, are sold out, Aghayev said. Unit sales ofkeffiyeh scarveshave risen 75 percent in the 56 days between October 7 and December 2 on Amazon.com compared with the previous 56 days, data from e-commerce analytics firm Jungle Scout showed. Searches for “Palestinian scarf for women” rose by 159 percent in the three months to December 4 compared with the previous three months; searches for “military scarf shemagh,” “keffiyeh palestine” and “keffiyeh” rose 333 percent, 75 percent, and 68 percent, respectively. The keffiyeh, with its fishing net pattern, is common throughout the Arab world, with roots dating as far back as 3100 BC. It first came to symbolise Palestinian resistance during the1936 Arab Revoltagainst British rule and later became the signature headgear of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat. While Hirbawi is the best-known manufacturer, others include small artisans and global copycats; luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton sold a version in 2021. US supporters of the Palestinians and Israel havefaced threatsand attacks since the Middle East conflict began, with Jewish Americans seeing an increase in anti-Semitism and Muslim Americans an uptick in Islamaphobia. Hazami Barmada, 38, a former United Nations official who lives in Virginia, wore a keffiyeh recently as she protested outside the White House and in Washington’s Georgetown neighbourhood in support of aceasefire in Gaza. Donning the scarf felt like a “superpower,” she said, reconnecting her with her Palestinian heritage and offering a symbolic link to children in Gaza. But she believes it also attracts verbal abuse. “I’m taking a calculated risk,” said Barmada. At New York City’s Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting in November, one attendee who wore a keffiyeh had it yanked off by a security guard – a moment captured in a Reuters photograph. The security officer approached protesters at the front of the crowd who had a banner, a Palestinian flag, and a keffiyeh worn by one demonstrator. The guard grabbed all three items, taking the keffiyeh from around the neck of the protester, photographer Eduardo Munoz said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has documented several instances of people targeted for wearing a keffiyeh, from a father assaulted on a Brooklyn playground to a Harvard University graduate student who was told she was wearing a “terrorist” scarf. In the most serious incident, three college students of Palestinian descent – two wearing keffiyehs –were shotin Burlington, Vermont, while taking a walk last month. Hisham Awartani, 20, is paralysed from the chest down. Authorities have chargeda suspectwith attempted murder in the shootings and are investigating whether it was a hate-motivated crime. Tamara Tamimi, the mother of one of the students, Kinnan Abdalhamid, told CBS News last week that she believed they would not have been targeted if they had not been “dressed the way that they were and speaking Arabic.” Students for Justice in Palestine(SJP), a group at the centre of US campus activism since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, has been encouraging students to “wear your keffiyeh” in solidarity with the students shot in Vermont in the week after the incident.

Still, in Houston, Texas, SJP member Anna Rajagopal said she and other members had not worn their keffiyeh outside spaces they considered friendly to Arabs and Muslims since October, after people waving Israeli flags surrounded a cafe they were in, screaming insults. “Myself and a friend have been cognizant of taking off our keffiyehs after leaving Palestinian, Arab spaces to be safe,” said Rajagopal, 23, a freelance writer who graduated from Rice University in May and is also a member of Jewish Voice for Peace, a group that advocates for Palestinian independence. Demand is unabated, though, sellers say. “If we could stock 20,000 keffiyehs, we would have sold them,” said Morgan Totah, founder of Handmade Palestine, a group based in the Palestinian city of Ramallah that sells local artisans’ wares online.",Published On 5 Dec 2023
Lebanon army says one sol­dier killed in Is­raeli shelling on bor­der post,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/lebanese-army-says-one-soldier-killed-in-israeli-shelling-near-border,"Israeli army says expresses ‘regret over incident’, reviewing strike that harmed Lebanese troops. A Lebanese soldier has been killed in Israeli shelling on a military post near the country’s southern border, Lebanon’s army said, the first such death sincecross-borderhostilities began in October. Three others were wounded, according to an army statement on Tuesday, after the attack on the frontier post on Oweida hill. On Wednesday, the Israeli army expressed “regret over the incident” and said it was reviewing a strike that harmed Lebanese troops. “The Lebanese Armed Forces were not the target of the strike. The IDF expresses regret over the incident. The incident is under review,” the military said in a statement. Earlier today, IDF soldiers operated in self defense to eliminate an imminent threat that had been identified from Lebanon. The threat was identified within a known launch area and observation point of ​​the Hezbollah terrorist organization, near al-Awadi. Hezbollah’s activities… — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF)December 5, 2023  “An army military position in the … Odaisseh area was bombarded by the Israeli enemy, leaving one soldier martyred and three others injured,” according to the statement from Lebanon’s army. The attack marked the first time that a member of Lebanon’s armed forces has been killed since the current round of fighting between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas inGazastarted on October 7. Since then, Israel and armed groups in southern Lebanon – some 200km (124 miles) from the Gaza Strip, particularly the powerful Iran-backedHezbollah, have engaged in back-and-forth exchanges across the border that have killed more than 100 people, about 80 of them Hezbollah fighters. Since Friday, when atrucebetween Hamas and Israel collapsed, Israeli forces and Hezbollah have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border on a daily basis. On Tuesday, Hezbollah said that its fighters had attacked four Israeli positions along the border, while Israel said that several missiles launched from southern Lebanon fell in vacant areas. Lebanon’s National News Agency reported that Israeli forces had shelled and carried out air raids in the area of southern Lebanon near the border. Despite the steady pace of tit-for-tat reprisals, Israel and Hezbollah have so far taken steps toavoid an escalationthat could lead to a large-scale war. Lebanon’s army has not been involved in the fighting. In late November, aUN peacekeeping forcein southern Lebanon said that its forces had come under fire from Israeli forces, an incident it called “deeply troubling”. Noting the Lebanese army confirmation of its soldier killed in Israeli shelling, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said that the “Lebanese Armed Forces have not engaged in conflict with Israel”, and that “we have seen a rapid and alarming increase in violence”. The Lebanese Armed Forces have confirmed that a soldier was killed and three injured when their base was hit by the IDF today. This is the first time, a LAF soldier was killed during this critical period. The Lebanese Armed Forces have not engaged in conflict with Israel. — UNIFIL (@UNIFIL_)December 5, 2023  Tens of thousands of people in communities near the borders of both countries haveevacuated their homes, fearful that they could be caught up in the middle of an escalation if it eventually takes place.",Published On 5 Dec 2023
‘Gaza’s en­tre­pre­neurs are be­ing killed by Is­rael’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/gazas-entrepreneurs-are-being-killed-by-israel,"Entrepreneurial leaders are being killed, leaving a gaping hole in the world of startups and businesses. Gaza Strip –The entrepreneurs of Gaza, a close-knit group who worked hand in hand to improve new graduates’ prospects, are reeling from the relentless killing of their colleagues by Israel as it bombards the blockaded Gaza Strip. Mohammed Sharif Yousef, an entrepreneurship consultant at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), has lost many friends and peers, some of them killed after they were displaced to the areas in the south that the Israeli army claimed were safe. Yousef himself was displaced from his home in Gaza City and is now in the southern city of Khan Younis. He has more than 10 years of experience as an entrepreneur, trainer, mentor, and coach, but his displacement put him in a new role: volunteer relief worker. “Families didn’t have the money to buy flour, which was barely available, or canned goods or vegetables,” he said. Yousef used his motorcycle to deliver provisions to families who needed them. Eventually, his bike ran out of fuel so he kept running it using paint thinner, which led to some malfunctions but still enabled him to go out daily. But as the casualties from Israel’s aerial bombardment kept increasing, he stopped going out. The people in Yousef’s network had been the ones who found technological solutions to Gaza’s problems and, as their institutions grew, had created jobs for graduates with few work opportunities due to a 17-year siege imposed by Israel on Gaza. On October 30, Yousef heard that his good friend Tariq Thabet, who directed the business incubator at the University College of Applied Sciences in Gaza, had been killed. “I didn’t expect it,” Yousef said, in shock. “He had just returned from a trip from the US after receiving a Fulbright scholarship.” Yousef said Thabet had, over about a decade and a half, helped thousands of young people find jobs, making a huge difference in a region as constrained as Gaza. On November 14, two weeks after Thabet’s death, Yousef received more devastating news – Abdelhamid al-Fayoumi, another friend, had been killed. The two had become close friends after working together including at Gaza Sky Geeks and Work Without Borders. They were roommates at a certain point, Yousef said, adding that Abdelhamid was a fantastic cook, whipping up mujadaras (rice and lentils with caramelised onions) and maqlubas (a layered meat, vegetable and rice dish cooked one way and flipped the other upon serving) on a moment’s notice. They had promised to sit down with each other after the war, to talk about ideas and explore new horizons. Al-Fayoumi had founded Sanabel, which produced software and multimedia resources for the local and regional Arab markets. “Sanabel moved from failure to success and then sustainability, with a team working at an international level,” Yousef said. “What I loved about him was his diligence and the high productivity of his team. He … achieved success for many entrepreneurs in Gaza, but now that has all stopped. Israel is killing Gaza’s entrepreneur cadres.” As Israel’s brutal offensive on Palestinians in Gaza nears the end of its second month, the scale of destruction goes beyond the physical. The human cost has been staggering. According to the health ministry in Gaza, more than 15,500 people have been killed, and another 6,800 are missing under the rubble of their homes, presumed dead. With more than 41,000 others wounded, this means that one in every 40 Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip has been killed or injured by Israeli attacks. The vast majority of the victims are civilians – men, women and children. Among the professional class, dozens of doctors, university lecturers, business owners and journalists have been killed. In addition, roads, universities, historical buildings and places of worship have been targeted by Israeli warplanes and artillery. At least 60 percent of residential units in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or damaged, in addition to 339 educational facilities. The targeting of an ethnic group’s political and economic leadership is known as “eliticide”, a word coined in the 1990s by British journalist Michael Nicholson to describe the Bijeljina massacre in Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to Arnesa Buljusmic-Kustura, a genocide expert, researcher and lecturer, the purpose of eliticide is to prevent the targeted community from regenerating or rebuilding itself. “Targeting intellectuals, academics, activists, leaders of any sort has always been a common thread in genocide,” shewrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Killings of the most notable of your community are done to make you remember nobody is safe, to make you lose hope, to ensure the community doesn’t resist or reorganise.” On the same day al-Fayoumi was killed, Gaza’s entrepreneurs were dealt another heavy blow when Dr Yasser al-Alam, the “godfather of entrepreneurship”, was killed in an Israeli attack on the central town of Deir el-Balah. “Dr Yasser … was a calm thinker and was keen on initiatives for innovative solutions,” Yousef recalled. Al-Alam was known for finding unexpected solutions and creating innovative marketing strategies. “We expected [al-Alam] to have a great impact in the future, but his influence will remain in our hearts and minds,” Yousef said. “All those who passed away in this war, whether I mentioned them or not, left a painful impact,” Yousef said. “We must make their killings the fuel that pushes us towards the success of entrepreneurship in Gaza to complete their journey.”",Published On 5 Dec 2023

‘Mas­sacres await’: Pales­tini­ans in Nablus warn of dead­ly set­tler at­tacks,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/5/massacres-await-palestinians-in-nablus-warn-of-deadly-settler-attacks,"The Palestinian villages south of Nablus face severe settler violence and warn the assaults will only increase. Nablus, occupied West Bank –No matter how hard he tries, Abdulatheem Wadi is unable to hide the devastating pain written all over his face. With his eyes fixed on the distance, the 50-year-old chokes up as he recalls how Israeli settlers murdered his 63-year-old brother Ibrahim and his 24-year-old nephew Ahmad, on October 12, while they were attending a memorial service for a group of Palestinians also killed by settlers the previous night. What was a funeral for four became a funeral for six. “It was a massacre in a small village,” says Abdulatheem. That village is Qusra, home to some 7,000 Palestinians living just south of Nablus in the northern occupied West Bank. Even though the funeral procession and its planned path were approved by the Israeli army through the Palestinian Authority (PA) side of the District Coordination Office (DCO), it was still attacked, Abdulatheem explained. He was standing some 20 metres (66 feet) away from his relatives when they were shot dead. “We were surprised to find a settler ambush. My car was the first car in the procession – I was in front of the four ambulances carrying the four martyrs,” he recalls. “Armed settlers then jumped onto the main road, put burning tyres and blocked our path. We couldn’t go forward or back – it was chaos. Then, there was indiscriminate live fire and rocks being thrown at us by the army and settlers,” says Abdulatheem, adding that the “Israeli soldiers were standing with the settlers and were shooting at us.” “Within minutes, another settler car came and fired at my nephew and brother while they were standing on the street after they had gotten out of their car, killing them,” he continues, his voice cracking. “My other nephew Yasser – Ahmad’s brother – is 14 years old. The settlers showered the car he was sitting in with bullets,” says Abdulatheem. “He doesn’t speak any more. Many people have tried to get him to talk, with no luck.” Settler attacks have been a daily reality in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967 when Israel occupied those areas with the approximately three million Palestinians living there. At least 700,000 Israelis live in illegal, fortified, Jewish-only settlements across the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, the majority of which were built either entirely or partially on private Palestinian land. Attacks include shootings, stabbings, fatal rock-throwing, severe beatings with pipes and wooden sticks, as well as arson and serious damage to homes, vehicles and agricultural lands. Israeli settlers killed three Palestinians in 2022, five in 2021, and two in 2019. The overwhelming majority of perpetrators do not face any accountability for their crimes. But since October 7, settler attacks have increased exponentially in the occupied West Bank. That day, the Gaza-based Hamas armed resistance group launched a surprise operation just outside the besieged Gaza Strip on Israeli territory, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel responded immediately with a relentless shelling campaign and later a ground invasion that continues to this day, killing close to 16,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,000 children. In tandem with Israeli attacks on Gaza, settlers have killed at least nine Palestinians over the past 58 days. They have been raiding Palestinian villages daily, assaulting residents and their properties, and have injured dozens. The United Nationsnotedthat “in nearly half of all incidents, Israeli forces were either accompanying or actively supporting the attackers”. Abdulatheem’s family members were among those killed by settlers after October 7. His brother Ibrahim was a father to 11 children. “My brother was very educated. He graduated with an MA in chemistry from Pakistan, and worked at the Ministry of National Economy in Ramallah,” Abdulatheem says with pride. Ibrahim also worked with villages in south Nablus to form protection committees and local councils for residents. “Ahmad was his second-eldest. He completed a law degree and was engaged to be married,” continues Abdulatheem. The governorate of Nablus, particularly the villages south of the city, is consistentlythe most affectedby settler attacks in the occupied West Bank every year, followed by Hebron and Ramallah. The same cities have thehighest numberof illegal Israeli outposts, which correlates with the high level of violence. Israeli outposts are housing communities with dozens of residential units built outside the borders of a settlement to seize more Palestinian land and “create facts on the ground”.  All Israeli settlements, including outposts, are illegal under international law. Israel, however, considers only outposts as illegal under its own laws, claiming that they were built by individual settlers or settler groups, and not by the government, even though the latter provides infrastructure, support and funding for the outposts. In addition, the Israeli government has over the past few years retroactively legalised many outposts and passed legislation that makes it easier to do so. Yitzhar, six kilometres (about four miles) southwest of Nablus the most notorious, has at least six outposts extending out of the illegal settlement, home to hundreds of settlers. Settlers living close to Palestinian villages in the south of Nablus, sometimes metres away, are also among the most violent in the occupied West Bank and have carried out deadly attacks, including Yitzhar, Itamar, Adei Ad, Esh Kodesh and Har Bracha. The presence of Israel’s illegal settlements,the separation wall Israel builtto annex more Palestinian land from the West Bank,and hundreds of military checkpoints and bases have turned the West Bank into 165 disconnected Palestinian “enclaves” suffering from severe development and movement restrictions. In the northern and central West Bank, illegal Israeli settlements separate the villages south of Nablus from the villages north of Ramallah, where the majority of settler attacks in those areas take place. “We have a problem in the south of Nablus. Here we have the seven [settlement] hills: Eli, Shiloh, Ahiya, Kida, Adei Ad, Esh Kodesh and Shvot Rahel,” Abdulatheem meticulously recites. “The villages of Burin, Madama, Asira al-Qibliya, Urif, Huwara, Qaryout, Jalud, Duma and Qusra in Nablus, are the last villages before the towns of Turmus Aya, al-Mughayyer and others north of Ramallah. These are the most targeted,” continues Abdulatheem, noting that the settlers “want to take these lands”. In July 2015, Israelis living in Adei Ad descended on the village of Duma and set the Dawabsheh family home on fire, killing an 18-month-old baby and his parents. In 2019, a 38-year-old Palestinian man in the village of al-Mughayyer was shot dead by settlers from Adei Ad, who also wounded another 30 people, of whom six were shot with live ammunition. In 2023, two large settler attacks took place in the same areas. In February, hundreds of Israeli settlers attacked the village of Huwara, killing a 37-year-old Palestinian man and torching dozens of homes and cars in what was described as a “pogrom”. A similar attack took place in June on the village of Turmus Aya, where another Palestinian man was also killed. Top Israeli officials have publicly incited more violence. In Huwara, after the attack, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also has authority over the army, called for Huwara to be “wiped out”. Some 20km (13 miles) west of Qusra is the small village of Madama, home to about 2,300 people. The village is sandwiched between the illegal settlement of Yitzhar and Route 60, the main highway used mainly by settlers and built on part of the village’s land. On October 18, Israeli settlers attacked the Ziadeh family home while the army shot live ammunition. At least 30 people were in the family building, including 15 children. “The settler attack on the house came in tandem with the Israeli army attack,” says 43-year-old Talaat Ziadeh. “A large group of terrorist settlers attacked our house and other houses in the area from 9:30pm until 1am. They burned several cars, smashed windows, tried to burn down homes,” he told Al Jazeera from his village. During the settler assault, Israeli soldiers opened fire at Talaat’s brother, 32-year-old Ahmad, shooting him in the foot. “I went up to the road outside our house. I was surprised to find a 16-year-old boy on the ground who the army had shot. I tried to give him first aid and carry him, when the soldiers shot me,” Ahmad tells Al Jazeera. The family, like many other Palestinians, say they “do not differentiate between the army and settlers. The settlers are soldiers and soldiers are settlers,” says Talaat. This reality has only become more evident after October 7, they explain. “After October 7, the attacks became more brazen and violent. The army protection and coordination with the settlers is much more open,” says Ahmad. “If we use anything to defend ourselves – rocks, sometimes kitchen tools like plates and cups – the army immediately shoots live ammunition at us,” he continues. Talaat agrees. “No one protects us here – we protect ourselves. We are fighting alone.” Amid the ongoing war on the Gaza Strip and the further arming of Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, the villages south of Nablus say they expect more attacks. “We are very afraid of what’s coming,” says Talaat. “Massacres await us in this area.”",Published On 5 Dec 2023
Pho­tos: Is­rael in­ten­si­fies strikes on Gaza’s sec­ond-largest city,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/5/israel-intensified-strikes-on-gazas-second-largest-city,"In Pictures Israel has intensified its bombardment in and around Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, as ambulances and private cars raced to a local hospital carrying those wounded in this new phase of the war in the enclave. Under pressure from the United States to prevent further mass casualties, Israel says it is being more precise as it widens its offensive into southern Gaza after obliterating much of the north. Aerial bombardment and the ground offensive have already driven three-quarters of the territory’s 2.3 million people from their homes. At the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, ambulances brought dozens of injured people in throughout the night into early on Tuesday morning. At one point, a car pulled up and a man emerged carrying a young boy in a bloodied shirt whose hand had been blown off. Israel has ordered people out of nearly two dozen neighbourhoods instead of the entire region, as it did in the north. But with most of Gaza’s population already packed into the south, cramming into United Nations shelters and homes, there are few places left to go. Israel has barred people who fled the north earlier in the war from returning. Palestinians say that as Israel continues to attack across the besieged territory, there are no areas where they feel safe, and many fear that if they leave their homes they will never be allowed to return.",Published On 5 Dec 2023
Is Is­rael’s Gaza bomb­ing also a war on the cli­mate?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/is-israels-war-on-gaza-also-hurting-the-climate,"Gaza’s water, soil and air have been devastated. And reconstruction will add to the carbon emissions. Many of the world’s leaders are gathered in Dubai for COP28, the annual United Nations summit on climate change. Some 2,400km (1,500 miles) to the West, meanwhile, Israel’s war on Gaza is raging. Sixty days into the war, Israel’s bombs have killed about 16,000 people, including more than 6,600 children. But increasingly, experts are also worried about its effect on the environment and on Gaza’s ability to combat climate change. From polluted water supplies to toxic smoke-filled air from burning buildings and bodies, every aspect of life in Gaza is now filled with some form of pollution. “On the ground, this war has destroyed every aspect of Gaza’s environment,” Nada Majdalani, the Ramallah-based Palestine director for EcoPeace Middle East, told Al Jazeera. Here’s a look at how the unstoppable bombardment of the enclave could further affect climate change in a region that has already seentemperatures increase, with projections of a 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) rise by the end of the century. Gaza has been under an Israeli siege for 16 years, with Israeli authorities holding the switch to — among other things — dependable access to fuel and power in the enclave. As a result, the people of Gaza turned significantly to solar energy to power their homes. “Gazans have been climate adaptive, and some 60 percent of their energy would come from solar power,” Majdalani said. But Israeli bombing has damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings, many of which were roofed with solar panels. “Destroying the solar panels is not only targeting the wellbeing of people, it’s diminishing the efforts of the Gazans in taking climate adaptation and measures to secure clean energy,” she said. “These solar installations now lay in the rubble with the buildings destroyed, setting back Gaza’s climate change efforts.” Amid the war, “getting figures and measurements of the extent of the damage” to Gaza’s environment is difficult, said Majdalani. But some things are clear. Decaying bodies and contaminated water supplies are a “ticking time bomb” that will lead to the spread of diseases, she said. “Right now this is the greatest concern, and everyone should be worried, including Israel. Having military might on the ground cannot protect them against the spread of cholera which is predicted.” Impending rains are another concern. Majdalani’s team estimates 44 percent of gas, water and sanitation facilities have either been completely or partially damaged in Gaza since the war began. This includes water wells and wastewater treatment. Sewage water has already flooded Gaza streets, but if rain mixes with the filth, the risks of cholera and other gastrointestinal diseases increase further. “The war damage to Gaza’s water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure makes flooding more likely with the winter rains,” Doug Weir, director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, an independent research body based in the United Kingdom, said. Even before the current war,inadequate sanitation infrastructureand electricity shortages meant that untreated sewage water was dumped into the sea and wasresponsiblefor more than one-quarter of illnesses. It was the primary cause of child morbidity in the Gaza Strip. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, the total shutdown of wastewater treatment plants in October, after Israel imposed a complete blockade on any fuel entering the strip, led to the release of more than 130,000 cubic metres of untreated sewage into the Mediterranean Sea daily, posing a grave environmental hazard. With the destruction amid the current war, huge volumes of debris and waste are blocking sewers, warned Weir. This, he said, “will allow more standing water, with associated risks to human health from transmissible diseases from wastewater mixing with rainwater.” This war, like others before it, requires vast quantities of fossil fuel, leading to excessive carbon emissions and pollutants in the environment. Earlier reportssuggest 25,000 tonnes of munitions were dropped on Gaza in the first few weeks of the war. The carbon emissions from this would equate with the annual energy use of approximately 2,300 homes, or the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from approximately 4,600 passenger vehicles. The world’s military forces also use fossil fuels to operate aircraft, tanks and weapons, accounting for approximately 5.5 percent of global emissions. The figure could be higher as defence forces are not bound to report their carbon emissions as it may undermine national security. “Methodologies to count emissions from conflicts are in their infancy,” Weir told Al Jazeera. But things are slowly changing. Last week, the UN Environment Programme’s flagship Emissions Gap report, which is released before each COP meeting, made mention of conflict and military emissions for the first time, calling for more research into the topic. Groups like Human Rights Watch have also accused Israel of usingwhite phosphorous munitions in Gaza, which added further to the pollution in the atmosphere, said Majdalani. “As Gaza enters the rainy season, we expect the rain to fall as acid rain, contaminated with white phosphorus.” People who use plastic sheets to collect rainwater to drink directly, amid a shortage of drinking water, could be particularly at risk, she said. In the first weeks of the war, the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA reported Israel dropped42 bombs every houron Gaza. In addition to the emissions from weapons, their manufacture also contributes to pollution, Weir explained. “Far more emissions come from them during production, for example in creating the metal for their casings.” Reports from Ukraine suggested the fighting there released some 100 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere in the first seven months of the war. So what about Gaza? “We anticipate that the bulk of the emissions in this war will be from military fuel use – Israeli jet fuel and diesel, from urban and landscape fires caused either by the destruction of buildings or targeted attacks, and from the carbon costs of reconstructing Gaza.” Other risks include fires, pulverised building materials that can include harmful substances like asbestos, and pollutants released from facilities containing hazardous materials. Even rebuilding war-torn areas that have turned to rubble causes significant emissions. “Producing concrete and cement to rebuild generates a large quantity of carbon dioxide, which contributes to the climate crisis,” said Weir. Lennard de Klerk, from the Initiative in GHG Accounting of War, did a rough calculation on how much GHG emission would result from rebuilding just residential and non-residential buildings that were destroyed or damaged after the first six weeks of the war. He told Al Jazeera, “5.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions would be released to produce construction materials and the emissions of the construction activities itself”. That is already a fifth of the projected emissions for the reconstruction of Ukraine from its war, which has been going on for 21 months as opposed to two months in Gaza.",Published On 5 Dec 2023

Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has accused the international community of “turning their back” on the Palestinian people amidIsrael’s bombardment of Gazawhile calling for a permanent ceasefire in the besieged enclave. In his opening remarks at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Doha on Tuesday, the emir accused Israel of committing a “genocide” in Gaza, noting that the “crimes” of Israeli forces help “deepen the sentiment of injustice and an absence of international legitimacy”. “It is a disgrace on the international community to allow this heinous crime to continue for more than two months – where the systematic and purposeful killing of innocent civilians continue, including women and children,” he said. “Why is the international community turning their back on Palestinian children and adopting dual standards?”  This is a modal window.

Aweeklong trucebetween Israel and Hamas, which collapsed on Friday, had been brokered by Qatar and other mediators to allow the release of captives taken by Hamas in October, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, oftenwithout charge. Sheikh Tamim said that while his country was still working to renew a truce, it was not an “alternative to a permanent ceasefire”. “We will continue to make effort with other regional and global players to have a permanent ceasefire established and all the aggression against the Palestinian people come to a halt,” he said. Leaders of six Gulf countries – including Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait – and Turkey are attending the summit in Doha. The war on Gaza is expected to take centre stage at the talks. Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays, reporting from Doha, said discussions will likely feature the prospect of Qatar-brokered negotiations leading to a potential resumption of a truce in Gaza. The prospect of reconstruction and the future governance of post-war Gaza will also be another topic of discussion, Bays added. Speaking at the summit, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said “Israel’s war crimes and its crimes against humanity in Gaza should not be left unanswered”. He added that Turkey’s priority is to “ensure that a permanent ceasefire is implemented in Gaza and humanitarian aid is delivered without any interruption”. Qatar’s emir added that the struggle in Palestine was not a religious one, nor was it a war on terror. “It is a national struggle between the Israeli occupation and the Palestinian people reeling under this occupation,” he said. “The solution lies in ending the occupation, and resolving the cause of the Palestinian people,” he added, urging the United Nations Security Council, especially the permanent members, to stand up to their “legal responsibilities” to help and end the war and force Israel to come back to the negotiation table to reach a “just solution”.

North­ern Gaza hos­pi­tal ‘over­whelmed by hor­ror’ as Is­raeli army lays siege,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/northern-gaza-hospital-overwhelmed-by-horror-as-israeli-army-lays-siege,"Health official describes gunfire and artillery shells outside Kamal Adwan Hospital as hundreds are trapped inside. Terrified civilians are trapped inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza as Israeli forces have encircled the medical facility, a senior official at the Ministry of Health tells Al Jazeera. More than 100 people have been killed in strikes close to the facility, the ministry said on Tuesday. “The Israeli occupation forces have laid siege to the hospital from all sides … We are targeted by gunfire and artillery shells,” said Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Health Ministry in Gaza, speaking from inside Kamal Adwan. “Patients, injured and those who took shelter in the hospital are gripped with fear; overwhelmed by horror,” he said. Footage from Kamal Adwan showed bodies swaddled in white, lined up in rows in a courtyard of the medical compound. Witnesses said anyone attempting to leave was being shot at by Israeli snipers. “We fear a massacre inside Kamal Adwan Hospital, as happened in [al-ShifaHospital] and the [Indonesian Hospital]”, al-Bursh said. Overnight, injured people continued to stream into the hospital amid ongoing bombardment, their heads and faces covered in dust. The hundreds of evacuees taking shelter there are shown resting or being treated on the floor by medics with extremely limited resources. “What do they want from us? They have already killed us. Our families and friends are dead,” a man at the medical facility told Al Jazeera. A second man explained that he moved to the hospital hoping to find safety from the Israeli air strikes, but his words were abruptly interrupted by the loud bang of an explosion that could be heard very close by. “We wished we were not left behind,” screamed a woman, her hands shaking and her voice imbued with desperation. More than1.1 million peoplewere ordered in mid-October to evacuate the north of the Strip and to move southwards as Israeli troops were advancing their ground offensive. Battles and aerial strikes stopped for aweeklong truceto allow the exchange of captives Hamas took in its attack on Israel on October 7 for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

Since the truce ended, Israeli forces resumed their attacks across Gaza with a renewed intensity in the north, while also expanding their operations to the south. Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed more than 15,900 Palestinians since October 7, after Hamas killed about 1,100 in Israel that day. While international pressure has been mounting on Israel to show restraint in targeting civilians in its second phase of the war, scores of dead have been reported each night. On Monday night, at least 158 people were confirmed dead, Gaza’s Health Ministry said. Of these, more than 108 were killed in strikes close to the Kamal Adwan Hospital; 40 dead bodies were received at the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis. The previous night, the ministry said 349 people were killed. The situation at the Kamal Adwan Hospital echoes the events that unfolded at theal-Shifa Hospital, the biggest of the Strip, where people seeking shelter, patients in critical conditions and doctors were ordered, some at gunpoint, to evacuate after several days of siege. Israel denied doing so. “The hospital is under attack by Israeli forces with the aim of evacuating all those inside the hospital,” said al-Bursh. “We, the medical staff, are holding our ground. We are standing by our patients and the wounded.”",Published On 5 Dec 2023
Ne­tanyahu’s much-de­layed cor­rup­tion tri­al re­sumes: Here’s what’s to know,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/netanyahus-corruption-trial-resumes-amid-israeli-war-on-gaza-what-to-know,"Netanyahu, who did not attend Monday’s hearing, has described charges against him as a ‘witch-hunt’. A corruption trial against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuresumedon Monday after a two-month pause due to the continuing Gaza war. He did not attend the hearing. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, bribery and breach of trust in three cases filed in 2019. He can be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail and/or a fine if convicted in a bribery case. Here is what there is to know: The first session of Netanyahu’s corruption trial was on May 24, 2020. The trial has been prolonged because it was initially paused due to COVID-19 and more recently, because of Israel’s war on Gaza following the October 7 attack by Hamas. Then-Attorney General Avichai Mandelblitannouncedthe Israeli prime minister’s indictment on November 21, 2019. The investigations were listed as cases 1000, 2000 and 4000. Netanyahu, who is the first sitting Israeli prime minister to face court as a defendant, has denied any charges and claimed that the indictments were part of a politically charged witch-hunt against him by his rivals to remove him from office. He can only be removed from office if convicted, which can also lead to him being sentenced to punishment. Netanyahu and the state could each choose to appeal the ruling. Doing so would take the case to the country’s Supreme Court, further prolonging a resolution. Netanyahu, who faced months of protests against his controversial judicial overhaul plan, has beenaccused of using the legislation to circumvent his legal troubles. The high-profile trial is expected to last several more months. An appeal process, if necessary, could take years. The Israeli leader is exempt from attending the court hearings, but he may be asked to testify within a few months, according to Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. Minister David Amsalem of Netanyahu’s Likud party called the resumption of proceedings during the war “a disgrace”. “War? Captives? … No, no. The most important thing now is to renew Netanyahu’s trial,” Amsalem posted on X on Sunday. Netanyahu remains highly unpopular and many Israelis blame him for security lapses leading to the October 7 Hamas attack – the deadliest since Israel’s founding in 1948. Netanyahu, the longest-serving Israeli prime minister – brought far-right Israeli politicians into government and boosted illegal settlements on Palestinian lands – pushing aside the political process for a Palestinian state as envisaged in the Oslo Accords of the 1990s. Long before the current war erupted, the killings of Palestinians by Israeli forces and settler violence had skyrocketed.",Published On 5 Dec 2023
‘We al­ways felt sym­pa­thy’: What’s be­hind Spain’s back­ing of Pales­tine?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/always-felt-sympathy-for-palestinians-tracing-spains-solidarity,"Spain, which has long supported Palestine in the ongoing conflict, has upset Israel with its consistent condemnation. Madrid, Spain –On Friday, a survivor of the 1937 Guernica massacre and a Palestinian protester will sound an alarm in the Spanish marketplace bombed by a Nazi legion, to pay tribute to the victims of Israel’s bloody campaign in Gaza. Hundreds of people in the Spanish town, which became an international symbol of the horrors of war thanks to Pablo Picasso’s masterpiece, will form a human mosaic, dressed in the red, black, white and green of the Palestinian flag. Guernica was bombed by the Nazi Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War, killing scores of defenceless civilians as Germany supported General Francisco Franco’s Nationalist forces. Piccasso’s large oil painting, named after the town, portrays extreme suffering, including an image of a crying mother holding her lifeless child. That scene within the painting will be represented at Friday’s protest, said Igor Otxoa, spokesperson for the Guernica Palestine organisation. “We have always felt sympathy for the Palestinians because we suffered under the dictatorship and have undergone a long conflict with the Spanish state and independence groups here,” Otxoa told Al Jazeera. The symbolic gesture is in line with Spain’s historic support of Palestinian rights, but comes at a tense time, as Madrid leads the few Western countries which are increasingly criticising Israel. At least 15,900 Palestinians have been killed in less than two months of the latest episode of the Israel-Palestine conflict, which escalated when Hamas, the group which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 captive. Israel says its military action in the densely populated strip is designed to crush Hamas, which the United States, United Kingdom and European Union consider a “terrorist” entity. On Monday, Palestinian health officials said that about 70 percent of the victims were women and children. Last week, as images of child victims and bombed-out buildings flooded social media, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said given “the footage we are seeing and the growing numbers of children dying, I have serious doubts [Israel] is complying with international humanitarian law”. “What we are seeing in Gaza is not acceptable,” he added. Sanchez’s words prompted a swift response from Israel, which reprimanded the Spanish ambassador to Jerusalem and withdrew its own diplomat from Madrid. The Spanish leader, who has also condemned Hamas for its assault, is the highest-ranking and most well-known European official to condemn Israel, joined only by politicians in Ireland and Belgium. Meanwhile, marches in favour of the Palestinian people have been held in cities across Spain. Josu de Miguel, professor of constitutional law at Cantabria University, described Spain as “sociologically, a pro-Palestinian country”. Sanchez heads a minority left-wing government which includes the far-left Sumar and Podemos parties, which are outspoken in their support for the Palestinians. “Sanchez said Spain would beprepared to recognisean independent Palestinian state. This is not the position of the European Union, therefore, it took a unilateral stance,” de Miguel told Al Jazeera. “The Spanish [coalition] government is composed of parties which are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and not Israel. Another factor is that in Spain, the left demonstrates more than the right.” Some analysts believe that Spain’s solidarity with the Palestinian cause may be rooted in its own history. Spain has only a small Jewish community of up to about 50,000 people, partly because of a historical hangover. To compare, the community in France, which is home to Europe’s largest Jewish minority, is about 500,000 people. In 1492, with the Alhambra Decree, Catholic monarchs expelled the Jewish population. In 2015, more than 500 years later, Spain offered Jews an apology by way of granting citizenship to Sephardic Jews around the world. During General Franco’s rule, fascist Spain, isolated by the West, was aligned with Arab states. Diplomatic relations with Israel only began in 1986 – 11 years after the dictator’s death. “Though there is controversy over whether Franco was anti-Semitic or not, during the dictatorship Spain never recognised the state of Israel and cultivated good contacts with Arab countries,” said Ignacio Molina, an expert in Spanish foreign affairs at the Autonomous University of Madrid. “During the transition to democracy, between 1976 and 1982, centrist governments never recognised Israel. This only happened in 1986 with the Socialist government as a condition for Spain to enter into the European Union.” In 2014, the Spanish parliament approved a symbolic motion in favour of recognising a Palestinian state. “There is a tradition on the left and right to be sympathetic to Palestine, even though those more on the right have supported Israel,” he said. In November, Oscar-winning film director Pedro Almodovar was among 350 filmmakers, actors, singers and other cultural figures who signed a manifesto which condemned the “criminal terrorist actions of Hamas” but warned that the group’s attacks “could not serve to justify the genocide which Israel practices against the Palestinian people”. Right-wing parties and Spain’s small Jewish community condemned the letter; both have also criticised Sanchez. “The position of the Spanish government has aligned it with Hamas. It condemns the terrorism of Hamas then goes on to accept the lies from Hamas as if they are a responsible government which cares for its people,” Rabbi Mario Stofenmacher, who represents Jewish communities in Spain, told Al Jazeera. He said Spanish society had become more polarised. “I wear bracelets with symbols of Israel, Spain and Ukraine on my wrist, but people have challenged me strongly about the Israeli bracelet,” Stofenmacher said. Alberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the opposition conservative People’s Party, has united with the far-right Vox party in accusing Sanchez of shaming Spain abroad. A survey published in November by the Electomania polling agency found 53.3 percent of Spaniards believed their country should take a more active role in trying to resolve the Israel-Palestine war, while 27.8 percent said Madrid should stay out of the conflict. About 17 percent were not sure. An earlier survey in October also found divisions. Some 21 percent favoured Israel while 24.3 percent backed Palestine, according to the poll for DYM. But 43 percent did not have a view about Israel and 47.6 percent felt the same towards Palestine. “The evaluation of the government’s performance on Israel or Hamas has a huge ideological and partisan bias; support and good evaluation from voters on the left, bad from those on the right,” Jose Pablo Ferrandiz, of polling company Ipsos Spain, told Al Jazeera. Cristina Lopez, a public relations executive from Valencia, believes geopolitics have become subsumed into domestic issues in Spain. “Like most, if not all, aspects of life in Spain, there is a domestic political subtext behind it and the conflict in Israel and Palestine is no different,” she said. “Sanchez’s latest words are sending a message to his coalition partners, Basque and Catalan nationalists, whose support he relies on to govern.” Spain’s inconclusive July elections meantSanchez was forcedto enlist the support of pro-independence parties in the Basque Country and Catalonia to form a minority left-wing coalition government. Nationalism in the Basque Country and Catalonia has meant some people in these regions are more sympathetic towards the Palestinians, because they identify with their position in relation to their powerful neighbours. “Some people in the Basque Country, where I am from, identify with the Palestinians,” said Itxaso Dominguez De Olazabal, EU advocacy officer at the 7amleh-The Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media, a Madrid-based think tank. “To them, Spain is Israel and the Basque people or the Catalans are like the Palestinians. But then again to (former Catalan leader) Carles Puigdemont, Catalonia’s experience is like Israel in founding a new state in 1948.” She believes that Spain’s political stance towards Israel is double-edged. “On the one hand, Spain condemns Israel’s actions but both countries maintain commercial links. Israel and Spain buy and sell weapons from each other,” she said.",Published On 5 Dec 2023
Is­rael and WHO in on­line row over re­moval of med­ical sup­plies in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/israel-and-who-in-online-row-over-removal-of-medical-supplies-in-gaza,"Israel denies ordering the UN health agency to remove medical supplies from its warehouse in southern Gaza. An online row has emerged between the World Health Organization (WHO) and Israel after the United Nations health body said the Israeli army ordered it to remove supplies from its warehouse in southern Gaza, a claim Israel then denied. The “WHO received notification” from the Israeli forces “that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use”, its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X on Monday. Today,@WHOreceived notification from the Israel Defense Forces that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use. We appeal to#Israelto withdraw the order, and take every possible… — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros)December 4, 2023  He appealed to Israel to withdraw the order and take measures to protect infrastructure such as hospitals. The Israeli army snapped back on Tuesday, saying it never issued such a warning. “The truth is that we didn’t ask you to evacuate the warehouses and we also made it clear [and in writing] to the relevant UN representatives,” COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, said on X. “From a UN official we would expect, at least, to be more accurate,” it added. “This is a social media row that is burning up and we can expect that it will continue to rumble on,” said Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem. “We can see that the WHO did take this seriously to start moving stuff out of the warehouse,” our correspondent said, adding that the warehouse services 11 hospitals in southern Gaza, and there were concerns among UN officials that the removal of supplies could lead hospitals in the south to become even more overwhelmed. “This has the possibility of growing into a bigger diplomatic row,” he noted. The WHO, like other UN agencies, has repeatedly called on Israel to restrain its use of force to avoid targeting civilians and medical facilities in its military offensive in Gaza. Meanwhile, on Monday, Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, warned that an “even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond”, adding that “the conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist”. Since the end of a seven-day truce, Israeli forces have pushed into southern Gaza, “forcing tens of thousands … into increasingly compressed spaces, desperate to find food, water, shelter and safety”, Hastings said in a statement. “Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go.” After Hamas launched an assault in southern Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1,100 people, Israel has bombarded the Gaza Strip, killing more than 15,900 Palestinians,including 6,600 children. Entire neighbourhoods have been pulverised; about 1.9 million people, more than 80 percent of the population, fled their homes. The WHO has recorded an unprecedented number of attacks on the strip’s healthcare system, including 203 on hospitals, ambulances, medical supplies, and the detention of healthcare workers.   After focusing most of its air and ground raids on northern Gaza for more than a month, the Israeli army announced over the weekend the expansion of its operations to the south following the collapse of the truce. The move spurred great concerns among health officials who fear a further deterioration of an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis. “We are flooded with an influx of dead bodies,” Munir al-Bursh, the director general of Gaza’s Ministry of Health, told Al Jazeera on Monday, describing a collapsed healthcare system unable to cope with the needs of the population amid an acute shortage of staff and medical supplies. Areas in the south are jammed with civilians who escaped bombardment in the north afterheeding Israeli evacuation ordersthat indicated southern Gaza as a safe space. But as that area is now being heavily bombed and tanks are approaching the south’s main city of Khan Younis, civilians describe a great sense of fear and frustrations on where to go next. The WHO issued a statement warning that intensifying military ground operations in Khan Younis “are likely to cut thousands off from healthcare, especially from the area’s two main hospitals, as the number of wounded and sick increases”. In the south, thousands of people are now sheltering at the Nasser Medical Complex and another 70,000 at the 370-bed European Gaza Hospital, the UN agency estimates.  This is a modal window.
