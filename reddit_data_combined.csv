,"Okay not trying to be pro or anti either side but what would make a Japanese person decide to come out and support either side? Is this a church group?

I’m in Thailand and understandably the Thai Muslims are very much Pro-Palestine but the average person here isn’t really invested enough to go protest for either side. I think it’s like this for most non-Muslim countries in Asia?

,"That was before the rules of war and the Geneva convention was made and Dresden bombings weren't significantly different to other cities bombings around the world. It was used by the Soviet Union after the war to make the west look bad as they held east Germany.

Many cities were bombed worse, even in Germany.

Not to mention the Nazis with the blitz.

Collective punishment is not okay. The world wars are something we never want to repeat. There was so much horrific shit happening in the world wars and we said ""never again"". That's exactly why the Geneva convention was born.

Zionist Jews are the ones committing war crimes now. Collective punishment is not okay.

People's responses to October 7th demonstrate a HUGE dehumanization problem,"On the morning of October 7th, I woke up to my Twitter timeline filled with gruesome videos and images of the October 7th massacre. I immediately was sickened. The first video I saw that morning when opening my Twitter was the girl in sweatpants, being taken out of a trunk of a car, and put in the backseat. She was bleeding from her backside.

I found the video incredibly triggering. What was even worse was the comments underneath - people saying ""how do we know she was raped?"" to ""she was a soldier, she knew what she got into"", and even ""she probably was sitting in blood, she's a soldier"". I'm someone who has historically been pretty pro-Palestine, but this was so demeaning, I just couldn't make sense of it. I also saw the video of them parading around that girl's body, and people even commenting on that, ""she was probably a soldier"". 

Worse were people saying, ""this is what revolution looks like"" - and the celebrations and protests that happened *hours* after news of October 7th came out. The crisis was still ongoing, and people were being so callous.

***There's no justification for any of this.***

The biggest point of hypocrisy was that these were people who championed the #metoo movement, who called everyone a Nazi for the most minor reasons, who were so sensitive to victims of violent crime. But in this instance, it felt like no one held those values anymore.

I made a video on this, talking about the insane responses on October 7th, as well as some of the far-left's largest content creators repeating these things. I think it's pretty damning. If you were upset by some of the stuff being said, maybe you like this video:

Gaza density: an example of Palestinian propaganda,"One of the most accepted factoids about how special Gaza is, is its density. Gaza is described as being one of the most densely populated places on earth. And this is used as an excuse for Hamas operating in hospitals because there's no room and they have no choice but to set up their bases under and around hospitals. 


 However a few quick Google searches are enough to show that Gaza or Gaza city don't even make the top 30 in the world.

Gaza Pop density: 6500/km2
Gaza city: 21000/km2

Just some other examples to gauge how densely populated Gaza is:


Tel Aviv: 7300/km2
Manhattan: 27300/km2
Bnei Brak: 28000/km2
Singapore: 8600/km2
Hong Kong: 6700/km2
Manila: 42900/km2
Monaco: 24360/km2

Palestinian flag wasn’t even invented until 1964 😂😂😂,"Fun fact the Palestinian flag was invented in 1964 😂😂😂 There was never an independent state called Palestine that belonged to Muslims it belonged to the British and before that the Ottomans for 400 years.

 If “the Palestinians” as people and a state existed why did they not call for independence from the Ottoman Empire during its 400 years of rule over that area? 

People forget Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria etc. also didn’t exist before 1918 they were also part of the Ottoman Empire. Only when Ottomans were defeated in ww1 were these countries founded yet Palestinians want to act like they were the special ones that always had “their own” country. Yet (I repeat), never had a flag until 1964 😂😂😂

Sounds like a very organised statehood inhabited by people of unity! It definitely wasn’t a region of wasteland which many Arabs from around the region settled in AFTER the British took control of the mandate! 

Palestinians could have had a state when the British offered the British controlled Palestine Mandate to be split between Jews and Arabs. Arabs said no, declared war on Jews, lost and have been crying about it ever since playing the victim since that’s ALL they can do and they do it amazingly - largely in part by ensuring as many of their civilians are in the firing line as possible whilst their BILLIONAIRE leaders such as Khaled Mashall reside in the luxury of Qatar.

It's all about hate for jews admit it.,"""from the river to the sea"" means preforming real genocide to all the jews in israel


""from the river to the sea' literally means performing real genocide to all the jews in israel. even those that were born there and who's parents were born there, but their great grandparents maybe fled from some muslim country that was performing pogroms on jews (for example me).

https://youtu.be/cJkxOF9QqEk?si=pPQ6hJouxM04VXLI

if you are aware of this and don't mind then fine, I hate it but can respect it, at least you have your values in order.

if you don't think it makes sense to kill and forcibly deport all the jews from their homes, then maybe you should call out against such chants, as they don't coincide with your values. this sort of slogan is exactly why no peace agreement can be reached and why the violence seems perpetual.

for those that will say that israel deported palestinians from their homes back in 1948 and 1967: (lets ignore the fact that israel didn't deport the palestinians, but has always given citizenship to palestinians in annexed territory.) most israelis today weren't alive yet at the time of these wars. blaming me and my peers for something our grandparents did makes no sense and has no justification.

,"Hamas has a history of doing this exact thing at this exact hospital 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shifa_Hospital

During the Fatah–Hamas conflict in June 2007, Fatah and Hamas clashed at the hospital, killing one member of each organization.[22] Some injured people brought to the hospital were killed by Hamas militants once inside. A doctor in the hospital reported, “The medical staff are suffering from fear and terror, particularly of the Hamas fighters, who are in every corner of the hospital.”[23] Hamas fired about 600 doctors affiliated with Fatah, threatening to shoot them if they returned to the hospital.[24]

During the 2008–2009 Gaza War, The New York Times reported that ""armed Hamas militants in civilian clothes roved the halls"" killing alleged collaborators.[28] Several reports by Israeli Shin Bet officials alleged that Hamas used Al-Shifa hospital as a bunker and refuge, knowing it would be spared by air strikes.[21] The Israeli allegations were difficult to confirm because Israel had banned reporters from Gaza at the time.[29] PBS' Wide Angle programme, which interviewed a doctor from Gaza who preferred to remain anonymous, said that he believed that Hamas officials are present under the hospital.[29] In 2009, the Palestinian Health Ministry, run by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, accused Hamas members of taking control of wards in Shifa Hospital, using them for interrogation and imprisonment, while withholding medical care. The ministry also called on Hamas to stop stealing and redirecting the medical resources to the organization's warehouses and centers (outside of the hospital).[30]

(2014 war)

Former Israeli Navy commander Eli Marom said Hamas leaders were hiding in basement of Al-Shifa hospital.[34] Washington Post London bureau chief William Booth wrote for The Washington Post that the hospital had become a ""de facto headquarters for Hamas leaders, who can be seen in the hallways and offices.""[35] Orde Kittrie described Shifa hospital as Hamas’ headquarters.[36] Hamas officials were also described as disguising themselves in medical attire within the hospital.[37] Amnesty International documented how the Hamas forces used the abandoned areas of the hospital to abduct, torture, and kill Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel.[38][39] Wall Street Journal correspondent Nick Casey tweeted a photo of Hamas MP and media spokesperson Mushir Al Masri conducting media interviews right outside of the Shifa hospital, but later deleted it.[40][41] The Guardian journalists saw Hamas officials at the hospital.[10] Reporting from the Gaza hospital to the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, Aishi Zidan reported that a rocket was fired from the area of the hospital. This was seized upon by the Israeli press, prompting the journalist to take to Facebook to note that her words had been taken out of context and used as propaganda, and that the rocket had actually been fired from ""somewhere behind the hospital"".[42]",1,Thelvl1bandit,2023-11-16 01:55:35,k9d30y7,,comment,t3_17vppt8,israelpalestine

It is infuriating, sickening, and disgusting to see so so many people deliberately drop IQ points when it comes to Jewish anything. Information is so accessible with Google, there is absolutely no excuse to be so laughably misinformed as to what Judaism is, the definition of Zionism, and so on.

And enough with the ""Jews are European"" business! We have been persecuted and gone through a freaking genocide  precisely because we aren't European, never mind that Jews are all over the world because we were scattered 2000 years ago when we were colonized by the Romans!

,"> Enough with the “Jews are European” business

There is a take that I keep hearing, and it’s usually within the realm of Ashkenazi jews not being “real” Jews

You know who I hear this from?  Non-Jews.  It’s always coming from THEM - never from other Jews.  I never once heard a Sephardic Jew, or a Mizrahi Jew, make the claim that Ashkenazim are just a bunch of white Europeans masquerading as Jews - the only people saying this, are people who are not Jews, and who know absolutely nothing about Judaism.

It really makes me wonder why people who are not Jews, who have no dog in that fight, want to go around making the call as to who is Jewish, and who isn’t.  Why can’t people stay in their lane?  Why can’t people just acknowledge the limits of what they know and what they don’t know?

(Quick edit - also, they ask you if you’re Ashkenazi Jewish when you go in for a mammogram, or a breast MRI.  It’s on the paperwork.  So, if you’re in your late 30’s/40’s, and going around claiming Ashkenazi Jews are a made up entity - you’re basically telling everyone that you don’t get your mammos.   And since breast cancer and prostate cancer are often genetically linked, I imagine that a similar set of questions is asked for prostate exams too.  And it’s not like the medical field is just a bunch of raging “Zionists” who wanted to make a point by putting that on the paperwork - they do this because there is legitimate research to back up the fact that Ashkenazi Jews are at a higher risk for certain diseases).

Second, the idea of “Jewish supremacy” is another take I keep seeing.  Not only does Israel *not* rule with Jewish supremacy… the idea of Jewish supremacy simply does not make sense.  “Chosen people” goes along with the laws against proselytizing.  If you can’t proselytize with Judaism, you can’t rule with Judaism.   On top of that, it’s an insult to people who actually know Israeli culture, to claim that it’s ruled by “Jewish supremacy.”  If this were true then there wouldn’t be the churches, the mosques, the Druze communities.",1,marilern1987,2023-11-16 01:19:49,k9cxq6g,,comment,t3_17vn7lp,israelpalestine

,"People make decisions largely on emotion and not facts. They then seek facts that validate their position. They consider themselves intellectual but they are anything but. 

Most of the arguments I see in support of Palestine are based around emotion and not fact. People feel empathy because they consider the Palestinians the weaker opponent and so must be the innocent party. Now I am now suggesting that the outcomes are not wholly disproportionate, but most arguments never seem to mention who the aggressor was.  We are seeing this playing out right now. If you go up to the biggest kid in the playground and poke him in the eye, expect to get you ass kicked badly.

I am sympathetic to the Palestinians but I mainly support the Israeli perspective. The arguments I don't agree with are:

Colonization- this argument is used constantly and I don't agree with it. The British took control of the region after WW1, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in a war that they started. I have no idea how this constitutes colonization and if you do they you are denying the existence of nearly every country on the planet. And back then there was no law against it, in fact The right of conquest was recognized under international law.  The fact that the Allies did not start the conflict only supports this claim further. Territorial gain as compensation for the cost and the lives lost in a war you did not start.

Apartheid: Another term very loosely thrown around the pro Palestine fraternity. All Arabs are allowed to live and work in Israel, they can run in the parliament if they wanted to and can own property. Israelis are not allowed to own property in the Palestinian controlled areas and have no rights. If Hamas and the PLO had more power they would absolutely instigate an apartheid structure against Israelis or even worse ethnically cleanse them completely. This is a stated goal of Hamas in their charter.

All the other wars: Lets not forget that the Arab nations have started every war against Israel with the sole purpose of wiping them off that land. The fact they have been shockingly unsuccessful  at it does not take away the fact they are the aggressors- every single time. And when the consequences of that action result in restriction of movement, walls, territorial loss, they do nothing but complain. Decisions have consequences and often they can be catastrophic.

The Peace Process: When the UN recommended the partition plan in 1947- with a 55/45 split- given that Israel was getting the south with was mainly desert, Israel accepted it. The Arabs did not, not because they did not think the split was inequitable, because they would never accept even 1% of the land going to Israel. Fast forward 5 attempts at a 2 state solution and Arabs have rejected every time and Israel has accepted every time.

While I feel for the Palestinians- they voted in Hamas- it has been a terrible decision for them and combined with the decades of other poor decisions is largely  the reason they are in their current position. Until they get over this preoccupation with taking all the land back, accept that Israel is not going anywhere, then I am confident that peace can be achieved.",1,nsfwrk351,2023-11-16 18:15:12,k9h12qh,,comment,t3_17w5jog,israelpalestine

,"I think this is what happened:

It started with a socialist idea: unite the working class. Show up at coal miner strikes and stuff. Then ""the working class"" got generalized to anyone low in any hierarchy: gays, women, black people, and more recently, the West v. the Global South.

So how did Israel, a nation of refugees fleeing The Middle East, Europe, and Africa to their indigenous homeland, become all-powerful, colonizing, ""The West""? The Soviets were the ones who started the rumor about Jews being a secret Western force, back when ""West"" meant U.S. rather than Soviet. So the Soviets attacked the Jews and forced them to flee to Israel. Then the Soviets wanted to expand their sphere of influence into the Muslim world, so they funded Arab revolts against Israel. Both Soviets and Arabs considered Jews ""evil Westerners"" who should go back to where they came from. The Russians wanted the Jews to go back to Israel, and the Arabs wanted Jews to go back to Russia.

The Muslim world of course considers itself part of the Global South that has been humiliated by the West. They blame Israel for the West because 1) their friends the Soviets called the Jews ""evil Westerners"" 2) Muslims consider a Jewish country a humiliation to Islam, since Jews are supposed to live as dhimmis under Muslim rule. So it was easy for the Muslim world to call Jews ""Western oppressors,"" and the far left just bought it without looking into any of this.

By the way, Hamas actually talks about the Elders of Zion, the Russian Bible of Antisemitism basically, in their charter. Their charter goes on for paragraphs with old Russian conspiracy theories about Jews.

Neither the Muslim World nor the far left actually care about Palestinians any more than they care about Syrians or Yemenis. Israel is just a convenient scapegoat for its ally and their common enemy: The U.S.",1,No-Butterscotch-5782,2023-11-16 13:38:44,k9g6nss,,comment,t3_17w6s3h,israelpalestine

Eventually they got scared and stopped organizing together and having protests. A college student in Gaza was arrested by Hamas for hosting a zoom call between young Gazans and Israelis who wanted peace and to know each others stories.

Take a look at the comments in this youtube video. Where does the straight up denial come from?,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWSP7ngFuZE

Where does the denial come from? Why do people not want to believe anything the Jews / Israelis say Why do they believe Jews 'own' and 'run' the media? Where do these conspiracies come from?

I mean the bias and prejudice has to be so deeply embedded in people's minds that they just outright refuse to believe the atrocities that happened on October 7. You can see them for yourself too - in video. They've been published online by Hamas - they're proud of it.

The same people blindly believe a terrorist organisations every word. Unreal.

Not make waves. Nonviolence. Many even thought they had succeeded. They were Germane first for example. The Holocaust proved only a Jewish homeland could protect Jews. The State of Israel will protect the Jews of October 7. Hamas assumed they attacked the pre WW2 mentality. Horrible mistake. Huge mistake.

I feel like the only conflicted liberal on earth right now,"Before I start:

War is immoral. Period. No one should be without food and water. No one should die or be harmed in any way over a disagreement. Ever.

My heart aches for the Palestinians just trying to live their lives, my heart aches for the Israelis affected by the horrific mass terrorist attack. Both cultures are so beautiful. 

I’m actually a huge fan of Arabic music and language, so if anything I’m more drawn to that culture. I would love to safely visit the Middle East one day.

I am not watching the news daily and am dealing with chronic health concerns-so it’s possible I am not up to date on things. Keep this in mind!

Now to get into it:

I completely understand that Israel has made Palestinians feel backed into a corner, which has created HMS. I understand there may be levels of radicalism within HMS. Maybe they don’t all believe in the kind of violence I hear they do. I also understand that it certainly sounds like Israel is obliterating Palestine and we are worried about genocide. 

I understand the continued bombing is going to create even more radicalized people. And please understand…the videos and photos I’ve seen, if accurate, of people hurt make me SICK. I have cried countless tears.

That said…I’m not hearing a word spoken against H@m@$ by Arabs-not until it’s nearly twisted out of them. In fact, I’m hearing almost praise?

Not only this, but the things I’m seeing many Arabs say about Jewish people have shocked me to my core. This is stuff they are posting publicly, so I can only imagine what they must say or think in private.

I have gone to bat for the Muslim and Arab community so many times throughout my life…but what I’m seeing and hearing has now made me wonder if I have been misled.

I’m trying to remember how I used to post when I was younger (the majority of…fiery…posts come from college kids or recent grads. For reference, I’m in my early 30’s), but I still don’t know if I would have, for example, wished death and rape upon my enemies aka Republicans.

It’s like we’ve forgotten that the extremists on one side are literally okay with rape and beheading…the worst crimes I can imagine…while the other side’s extremists want those that are in favor of that to cease to exist.

I feel incredible pressure as a liberal to vocalize support of Palestine in person and on social media. The watermelon emojis, filters, and flags are everywhere. I feel strong and silent judgement for not partaking, but I’m just so skeptical. How do I know aid is really going to innocents? It just feels like the perfect storm to rally aid to HMS…

I guess I just want to know I’m not alone in feeling confused and uneasy about things right now. I just don’t know what to believe anymore. Things feel so bleak.

I just want peace, happiness, and freedom for all. If you guys have any advice or unbiased sources you’d like me to look at, please send my way. 

Sending all my love to both my Arab and Jewish brothers and sisters.

TLDR; I’m a liberal who has become skeptical of the free Palestine movement. I simply don’t know who or what to believe anymore and just want peace. I feel alone and shunned. Just curious if any others feel the same.",43,NoBoysenberry1117,2023-11-16 08:37:22,17w4j7z,,post,,israelpalestine
,"There are far more people holding extremist views on the pro-Palestinian side, as you have seen. It is my personal opinion that most Jews both Israeli and diaspora believe that:

1. Both Palestinian Arabs and Jews have a right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland. What happened in the past happened, and at this point, strict borders must be drawn and an agreement must be made to officially recognize both Israel and the West Bank (+Gaza or Gaza as its own separate entity) amongst all parties.
2. Hamas is an evil terrorist organization that must be removed from power and held responsible for its attack on Oct 7 (and continuing rocket fire into Israel). Hamas is both the enemy of Israel as well as the enemy of peaceful Palestinians who genuinely wish to coexist with their Jewish neighbours.
3. The current Israeli government is bad. Like really bad. Another Trump presidency bad to put it into American terms. Bibi and his coalition which includes far-right extremists have only worsened relations between Jews and Arabs, have made inflammatory near genocidal remarks about palestinians, and encourage violence against palestinians in the West Bank by Israeli settlers. This government must go and those who have committed crimes should be punished.
4. Any and all innocent deaths is a tragedy. Focusing on Gaza, if there was a way to cleanly eliminate Hamas and remove them from power without a single innocent killed, everyone would be for that (except for Hamas and their supporters). Unfortunately, that just isn't how armed conflict works. Continuing to pressuring the Israeli government to limit civilian casualties is the best we as civilians can do. At this point, a ceasefire would do nothing but endanger the current Israeli ground operation removing Hamas from civilian buildings and tunnels, and allow Hamas to regroup and re-arm.

I, like you am a Canadian/American democrat. I see the way some people who claim to represent the democrat/liberal side seems to be using the exact same rhetoric that we assign to far-right MAGA people. Calling to ""globalizing the intifada"" or for ""the river to the sea, palestine will be free"" are thinly veiled calls for the ethnic cleansing of Jews from Israel, or worse.

,"

I remain deeply sympathetic with Palestinians and am personally not convinced that Palestinians are better off having Hamas lead them, people around me give me false information all the time such as ""Hamas doesn't run Gaza"" ?? Then who does? Or ""Israel is putting concrete into the water"" this was done in wells in the West Bank and I couldn't find any information on why other than it's racism or it was illegally placed there, nothing on it being done currently in Gaza. 

I have been very skeptical and researching both sides and trying not to fall into an ideological hole because the internet and it's algorithms and communities make that all too easy. I just don't really understand why SO many people in the west are so ardently pro Palestine.

Not to say I don't understand the want for people not to be bombed, for hospitals to be bombed, for children to die, for religious radicalism coming from Zionist or Islamists sentiments to exist. I don't want anyone to suffer, but I don't see how Israel couldn't just carpet bomb the entire strip and level the population if they really wanted to (not saying they should, of course. Just if their ends were to do this, they could be doing it way faster and better than they are) the population of Gaza has only dramatically increased over time, not shrunk. That's the shittiest genocide I've ever heard of. Even compared to the body count of regions around the middle east outside of this. 

I don't see how else Hamas is supposed to be dismantled - and yes, I understand the argument that extremism begets extremism and that the radical measures taken to stop Hamas from existing are only going to further radicalize a population into hating Israel / Jews.

 But fuck sakes, Hamas is giving children propaganda and pamphlets to prime them to hate Jews from a very early age. Hamas doesn't care about their own people and are setting up their bases and munitions in hospitals and schools for the deliberate purpose of using their own as shields and playing a PR game of attrition having Israel fight them in these populated and vulnerable areas. The death toll would be just as high or higher with a solely-ground assault on these places, especially when the civilians aren't leaving an active warzone. From what I'm understanding Israel is using highly accurate missiles to deal with these targets.

I can't help as a Westerner but see this current conflict as people with very cushy lives in the west reacting to a few simultaneously existing foundations within our cultural context that lead to us not being able to look at this situation rationally, as cruel and as fucked up as it all is. The first is the white vs Arab mentality of perpetuating violence onto Islamic populations, especially after the rise of Islamic terrorism post 9/11 and again in the early to mid 2010s with ISIS. The second is the colonial mentality of Europeans and the genocide committed against Indigenous populations that eventually created modern day America. The third, is we denounce war, I denounce war - I want a world without war, but if your enemy expresses religious zeal to wage war for the sake of Jihad, then there's no reasoning with an evil like this, they will play dirty, they will play with your corpse in celebration, they will take any opening in your armor to strike, for all this talk or geopolitics and ends of freeing Palestine as a land - I do not Believe for a fucking second that Hamas would use that freedom to do anything but get better weapons and find easier ways to kill Jews. 

If Israel does nothing here, Hamas will continue lobbing 10s of thousands of bombs at Israel, the Iron Dome costs a lot to run, and it isn't foolproof. If Israel goes in for a land invasion as they have, it's deemed genocide and displacement to ask the civilians to move out of where they're intending to attack, it's genocide to to not ask them to leave and have them die in the process, it's genocide to bomb extremely specific targets with advanced weapons in areas that were told to be evacuated.

,"You are not alone. Not by a long shot. Check out r/Jewish and you will see there are a lot of liberal/leftist Jews who are experiencing a similar “wtf” moment. 

I started paying attention to this because my late grandfather was Jewish but never spoke of it. I wanted to learn more about my Jewish heritage which naturally lead me to want to understand this conflict between Israel and Palestine. Let me tell you - anyone who says “it’s not complicated” is off their rocker. This conflict is extraordinarily complex. There are so many seemingly opposing truths to hold at once, so much misinformation, so much history and emotion… there are so many layers. And the complexity continues to evolve and grow even more so. The issue I’m seeing with my younger leftist friends is that they are grossly oversimplifying everything. They think in very black and white terms, view everything through a Western lens, and project America’s racial politics where they simply do not apply. They are fed a steady stream of covert antisemitism through social media. I see a lot of them sharing information from Al Jazeera which is owned by the Qatar government and is known to be an unreliable source of information. They chant phrases they don’t understand, cite history they don’t understand, spread misinformation without a second thought, and I’ve even seen some pro-Palestine protesters wearing Hamas headbands. The whole thing is a disaster. It is endlessly frustrating to watch. 

This war requires us to hold multiple harsh truths at once. My take, and someone please correct me if I am misinformed, is that Israel is damned if they do and damned if they don’t. Hamas is embedded in Gazan infrastructure. Their headquarters lie beneath a freaking hospital. There is almost no way for the IDF to get to them without causing civilian deaths. Hamas has vowed to repeat the atrocities of October 7 again and again and again. It is their goal to kill all Jews globally. The argument I have read against a ceasefire is that it will allow Hamas to attack innocent Israelis again. And yet, a ceasefire will save countless Palestinian lives. In other words - I don’t have the answer and I’m not going to pretend I do.

**What Israel is saying:**

The raid comes after Israel’s accusation of Hamas using the Hospital as cover for their military operations, which Hamas denies. The US further backs up this claim, saying they have intelligence, but so far have not released any information to the public.

**What Palestine is saying:**

Gaza health officials refute the claims that the Hospital is being used as a shield for Hamas operations. Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Health Ministry, said Tuesday that the hospital repeatedly invited international organizations to tour Shifa, but has not received a response.

I believe the only solution is the willingness to understand the other side,"EDIT BELOW

pretty much that's it. People who think all Palestinians are bad or all Israelis are bad are not even just ignorant, but maybe they just dont want to stop hating, finding all the reasons to hate, and debunking anything that may defy their belief of why the other side is wrong.

so I believe that it is not about facts or who is right, and who to blame, but the willingness to understand the other side.
I say willingness because even if you hate and don't understand the other side, your willingness to not hate will lead you out of it.
people who are not willing to live together, any way, method, and possible solution will never work.

playing the game of who to blame and who has done the wrong thing never works, clearly.

what do you think?

EDIT: This is not about governments and organizations, not specific incidents and conflicts, this is about people, if people are willing to not hate, understand, or at least not make revenges, then we have a chance for peace, one state, two states, doesn't matter.

,"Talk about hypocrisy, please check your own.

The claim that Israel's actions are ""self-defence,"" while they claim Palestinian resistance in the West Bank is ""terrorism"" is perhaps the most hypocritical argument I have ever seen in this conflict.

The justification for Israeli self-defence is the following. Hamas refuses to accept our right to exist, they threaten our right to self-determination and our human rights, thus we must invoke armed conflict to destroy them. Sure, no problem here, but what about when this line of reasoning is used against you? Will you accept it, or call it terrorism?

There are thousands of documented acts of brutality and oppression by the IDF/Settlers in the West Bank, many of which are recognized by Israelis themselves. The occupational settlements and position of the IDF in the West Bank mean that by definition, as an ""occupier,"" Israel's presence in the West Bank is one of an OFFENSIVE state. The settlements and occupation violate the Palestinian's human rights, their desire for self-determination, and their right to exist in their national home.

That being said, by international law, self-defence is permitted for the Palestinians in the West Bank, and that includes armed resistance against the IDF. By the way, these laws are the same laws you use as justification for why Israel's response to Oct 7th is ""legal"" and ""proportional"".

Furthermore, the settlers are an armed group, supplied and embedded with the IDF in the West Bank, whose explicit purpose is only to protect these settlers and the occupational agenda. How close are they to bordering the definition of a Militia? They exist in the same compounds, are armed by a military force, and exist in contradiction to international law with the purpose of exerting a nationalist/religious cause. Does the fact that they are in the position of offensive, armed and embedded with a military make settlements legitimate military targets?

I pose you a question.

If a Palestinian man in the West Bank is subject to the oppression of the occupation attacks an IDF compound in the West Bank tomorrow with a bomb, killing 15 IDF soldiers and another 30 Israeli settlers in collateral damage, would you call this self-defence or terrorism?",1,CulturalCranberry960,2023-11-16 07:55:48,k9eqr6d,,comment,t3_17w1uau,israelpalestine

,"If you are geniuenly wondering I can tell you what some people think.

First of all, being a Christian does not imply they are from Europe.

Second, if there is a Muslim in Morocco that meets a Jew on the street, they will not assume that this Jew is a European, but just assume they are Moroccan. So you're question is false.

However, I can assume you are really asking why do some Muslim, Christian and Atheist Arabs think that Israelis are European. It's a historic thing, because for about 60 years before Israel was created, when Arabs would meet Jews in Palestine, chances are that when they asked where did you come from, they would say ""I come from Russia/Moldova/Poland"" or something like that. I am not trying to make anyone feel bad, but this is just what it was like before, because 80% of Jews in Palestine in 1948 were Ashkenazi Jews, and a lot of them came during the migrations in the first half of the 1900s.

Later however, a lot of Arab Jews came to Israel, so why did this perspective survive? From an Arab perspective, I would say that because the Zionist movement was a European one, in a sense that it started in Europe, had its base in Europe, used European contacts to kick start it, then a lot of people see it as a European entity, not unlike for example French colonization of Algeria, and ignorantly conflates the establishment with the people following it.",1,RevolutionaryEnd6183,2023-11-16 17:46:54,k9gypeo,,comment,t3_17w8b9z,israelpalestine

Double Standards on the International Stage and Treatment of Minority Groups in Different Countries,"People talk about Israelis being disgraceful, but they never talk about other Muslim countries doing the same exact thing! People bring up Palestinians, but what about the Kurds in Turkey, Iraq, and Syria?
God bless the Palestinian people, but this is just a joke... Look at how Turkey even treats other NATO countries, Greece, for example, Turkey has on numerous occasions threatened to bomb them if they buy fighter jets from the USA. Muslim/Arab countries, even developed ones, are known to be the most radical in the world. Why are people acting like they aren't? Why are people in the west out to make Hamas look innocent or in any way shape or form make them look like freedom fighters, when they're doing the same exact thing the Taliban was doing and hiding inside of their civilian population?",16,IndexedClaim,2023-11-15 23:05:29,17vs8dx,Discussion,post,,israelpalestine

,"Yep been saying this all along. They're straight up copying the Dresden Goebbels handbook where he multiplied actual casualties by 10. And it worked, media back then decried it and believed the 250k number.  It wasn't until decades later they studied it, police reports, etc and actual number was closer to 25k. 

So I wouldn't be shocked if the actual number is closer to 1-2k. I mean look at that hospital 'bombing' where Hamas somehow magically knew within 5 minutes it was 500 dead.

Didn't matter at all. They cut one guys throat right on camera as he is begging for his life and crying out to his God (Allah).

I'm tired,"I live in Israel, but I've never really *felt* Israeli if that makes sense. I've never aligned with the culture, and I just didn't feel like a part of my country.

But all that changed ~~when the Fire Nation attacked~~ after October 7th. When Hamas broke in and massacred more than 1,000 people, torturing, burning, and raping them. At first, this only solidified the feeling of ""Why am I even here?"", I live in a country constantly under threat, that I don't feel like I belong to, so why?

It became very clear the second I opened social media. Mind you, this was Oct 7-8, before Israel began to retaliate. I saw people saying ""This is what resistance looks like"", people denying it and asking for proof **of women being raped**, and people showing support, for terrorists who entered a music festival and killed everyone they could.

Over the last month, this has gotten worse. I see anti-semitism every time I open social media, I see people call Israel genocidal, demanding we stop the war without an ounce of thought to the implications of doing that. I see people ripping posters of innocent children who were kidnapped while saying they care about innocent lives.

Although the majority of people doing those things aren't anti-semitic, the loud voices are, and the people who support them don't really understand what is happening and don't understand what they are supporting.

I'm tired of feeling unsafe. I'm tired of having to look at the time before I go out of the house to make sure I'm not stuck outside when there's an alarm. I'm tired of being stuck in a choice between anti-semitism outside of Israel, and Hamas in Israel. I'm tired of people thinking they know what war is when they never had to run into a safe room since they were 6 years old.

Before all the pro-Palestine crowd goes to say ""Well the children there feel unsafe too/are dead"", I know. I know they do, but the reality is that if Israel didn't defend itself properly, not 11,000 people would be dead, but all 9 million. When Hamas broke in, they didn't distinguish between civilians and soldiers. They didn't distinguish between children and adults. They killed everyone they could.

*“We can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children."" - Golda Meir*

I'm tired of this war. I'm tired of the anti-semitism. I'm tired of the violence. I'm tired of people who don't understand the situation. I'm tired of extremism. I'm tired of far-right Israelis.

,"The main reason people support the Palestinians is that they appear--on the surface of things--to be victims. Most progressive political groups divide the world, and the people in it, into ""oppressors"" and ""oppressed."" In this case they regard the Jewish people as the ""oppressors"" who immigrated to Palestine from Europe and ""colonized"" the area, taking the land away from the local Palestinians. They believe that Israel is using its strong military to ""wipe out"" the Palestinians and steal even more land, forcing the Palestinians into smaller and smaller pieces of land like Gaza or the West Bank. The argument is that the Jews made the Palestinians refugees in their own land, depriving them of a home.

The other view, which I support personally, is that the Palestinians lost most of their land in wars that they, and the Arab countries supporting them, started. They have attacked Israel at least 5 times. Israel won each time and gained more territory. In the first war, in 1948, the Palestinians left their homes, believing that invading Arab armies (who were helping them) would wipe out the Jews, and they would return a few days or weeks later after the Arab armies had won and the Jews were all gone. Unfortunately for them, the Jews won. Israel never let these Palestinians return to their homes inside Israel. The Palestinians call this 'the Nakba' (or the 'catastrophe'). Many blame Israel for the Nakba, but my view, and the view of most Israel supporters, is that the Palestinians helped to bring it on themselves. It's kind of like the situation now: the Arabs attacked, Israel responded with massive force, and the Arabs were deeply unhappy with the results. It should be pointed out that many Arabs never left their homes, and that's why 20% of Israel today is Arab, not Jewish.

I'm only giving you a bare bones explanation from a pro-Israel perspective. Not objective, but you can balance it with other perspectives to get the full story. The most important thing for me is that the Jewish people are from Palestine originally. They are the indigenous people of that region, and they lived there for thousands of years. The Jews migrated to other countries for a long, long time, but they always wanted to return to Palestine, and that's why they began returning in the late 19th and early 20th century (and especially after World War II and the Holocaust). Israel/Palestine is their traditional home, and most supporters of Israel fully support the idea that the Jews should have a state of their own in that region.

Another main issue is that Palestinians have relied on terrorism for 75 years to try to regain their homes. From my perspective and many others' perspective, this is completely unjustified terrorism. Oct. 7 is just one of many, many attacks stretching back 75 years. It's extreme, grotesque violence aimed at civilians, but those who support the Palestinians argue that this type of violence is justified, given the Palestinians' situation. You have to decide whether that type of violence is appropriate.

And lastly, I would just add how strange it is that progressive women, minorities, and members of the LGBTQ community would support the Palestinians. Hamas is an Islamist terror group that kills gay people, thinks women should be controlled by men, and has no time for non-Muslim minorities. So it's extremely strange, to me anyway, that they would march in favor of the Palestinians. But to the Palestinians' supporters, nothing is more important than the idea that the Palestinians are allowed to return ""home.""

Anyway, please read as widely as possible on the subject. It's long and complicated but also fascinating. What I've provided you here is just a rough outline. Palestinian supporters will obviously feel quite differently about some of these points and you can decide for yourself which narrative is closer to the truth.",1,Mikec3756orwell,2023-11-19 03:00:54,k9ryxnv,,comment,t3_17y57wn,israelpalestine
,"A. ) it is well known that Hamas operates an extremely powerful propaganda machine and has utter control by fear of death of not just the perpetrator, but their family and extended families as well if you speak out against the current government in Gaza, Hamas.

&#x200B;

B. ) It is largely seen as a powerful, strong country vs. an oppressed, poor people, as well as white/european appearing peoples vs. brown people.

&#x200B;

C. ) The reality. The verified, accurate history of the region is extremely distorted by short form clips online.  As short as I can make it, it probably won't be. Egyptian, Roman History, Biblical and archeological history(especially Judean coins) and records all prove that the Kingdom of Israel, with the lands of Judaea and Samaria all existed long before Palestine. The area of which is now Gaza, was named Philistine. The Romans overthrew the Jewish people and renamed the land that is now contested Syria-Palaestina. Then history continued. The people of mandate Palestine took on the national identity as Palestinians in 1923 to help their cause to maintain the land. The two state partition plan happened. The 1948 attack of the Arab League on the newly formed Israel, the second Nakba, which is referenced often and used to make Israel sound bad, well, let me break it to you, at the same time as 700,000 Palestinians where expelled/left freely as asked by their leaders... over 850,000 Arab Mizrahi Jews were kicked out of the rest of the Middle Eastern states, most where they lived for thousands of years. So really, I do not understand the emphasis placed on the Nakba as it similarly happened to the Jews, yet over 300,000 Arabs stayed in Israel, have now grown to over 2 million, of which  enjoy complete political, civil and religious rights in Israel. They sit on their Supreme Court, and fight in their military. Yet the middle eastern countries that expelled the Jews... none were able to return, and virtually none exist in those countries anymore. Those same countries all have very few if none as far as minorities go and have been cleansing Christians from their lands over the last 50 years. (That is also a very easy verification to make with a quick google search)

&#x200B;

Israel after that war was faced with a choice. Build a strong military as they had no political power in the middle east, surrounded by enemies that had just attacked them with not so strong militaries yet strong political might. They chose the former. And various governments argued over the use of force and military to continuously threaten the countries that bordered them.

&#x200B;

Multiple wars ensued, Israel always defending. Skip forward to 2005, Arafat died, and Israel pulled out of Gaza completely when Hamas was voted in. Israel even used the IDF to remove their zionist settlers from Gaza. Immediately after doing so, Hamas started launching rockets into Israel, and sending Palestinians into Israel with suicide vests (I'd recommend listening to the Son of Hamas interviews online -prior to this conflict about what Hamas does, and how they do it). So, what would any country do? Israel built a massive wall, and implemented a blockade and strict border crossings on Gaza. Israel STILL, though, while rockets are launched at them daily, saved only by the Iron Dome, send humanitarian aid, offer medical aid, and supply Gaza with both water and electricity. Why doesn't Gaza's government supply their people with those basic necessities? They receive over a billion a year. They give work permits to Palestinians to come work in Israel as there is no employment in Gaza. Israel has given tax-payer funded heart surgery to over 3,000 children from Gaza and surrounding nations. Gay Palestinians seek asylum in Israel as they are murdered in Gaza. The Arab Palestinians living in Israel, the 20% of their population? They have protected mosques where they can freely practice religion.

&#x200B;

Anti Semitism has ALWAYS been strong. We are seeing the same horrifying language used against Jewish people worldwide now as was seen used by the Germans. It's disgusting. Disgusting to use no matter who you are referring to.

&#x200B;

So why the history lesson? All of those details can easily be fact checked and confirmed. A background is needed because the rhetoric and lies being put out there by propaganda want you to think that Israel is an apartheid state, and is committing genocide. Apartheid.. well.. considering.. Israel supports a nation that launches rockets at them.. sends in children wearing suicide vests put on by those kids mothers.. gives aid, fuel, water and electricity.. and that Palestinians have full freedom living in Israel if they so choose to do so peacefully.. no. That is not apartheid. Genocide... a slap in the face to those who experienced real genocide. The deaths of Gazans is HORRIBLE, it is sad.. more Christians/minorities have been killed in the Middle East in the last 20 years.. look what is happening now in Myanmar.. where is the outcry.. where is the outcry now between what is happening in Armenia with Azerbaijan. Real genocide is what Stalin did to Ukrainians, what happened in the holocaust, what China is doing to the Uyghurs, what the US did to the Phillipines and Vietnam.. not the steady growth in population of Gazans, Arab Palestinians in Israel, and the Palestinians in the West Bank, regardless of their horrible life expectancy thanks to Hamas oppression.

&#x200B;

A social media war is being launched right now. Short form information, trigger words such as 'babies' are used OFTEN to incite emotion, lack of ethical, honest journalism by most major outlets which rarely retract or issue apologies for reporting information wrong, inserting the colonialism argument that has dominated the north americas and europe of late, lack of context. Constant accusations of actual events in history without giving the full story of what led up to Israel's aggression. Or understanding why they've had to become so aggressive surrounded by nations who have ACTUAL intent and have ACTUALLY stated such in their declarations of state that they want to cleanse Jewish people from 'the river to the sea'. Whereas Israel's declaration of independence says that they want to live in the pursuit of peace and prosperity with their neighbours. People think/see white jews in America oppressing poor brown people in Gaza without realizing the amount of Mizrahi Arabic Jews that live in Israel. People blame Israel for Gaza's weakness when Hamas doesn't let them thrive or give them opportunity. Israel builds their people up, supports them, offers a life of freedom and represents the western values of the west in a small pocket of land in the Middle East. And all of those middle eastern countries do not want that.

&#x200B;

D. ) The latest generation is probably one of the least educated generations. Social media dominates lives, over 30% of young people under 20 get their news from social media like Tik Tok, and look who owns Tik Tok. Multiple powers are at play in this. AI has reared its head. Somehow Osama Bin Laden is lauded as a saviour and a righteous man with good intent. What the hell happened?

&#x200B;

E. ) Most people clearly are not educated in the contextual and extremely convoluted history of that land and the various governments that have argued how to go about finding peace properly. Zealots and fanatics are on both sides, the Jewish and the Arabs. But the average person just wants peace.

&#x200B;

Ask yourself this? If Israel laid down their weapons, what would Hamas do? Well, they've stated repeatedly that they want to repeat Oct 7 again and again.

&#x200B;

Before the terrorist attack on Oct 7th. Israel was not waging war against Gazans or Hamas. So I would venture rather safely, it's easy to say if Hamas laid down their weapons Israel would stop the offensive, the war they DID NOT start. Heck, they havn't even killed the hamas prisoners they captured. They will go to trial.

&#x200B;

I kind of put most of this for the people who are stating that Hamas is right. And Israel is evil. Israel is not perfect. They have always been in a shit position from the start. I just hope people do a little more unbiased research, preferably from sources prior to this recent conflict, because the anti-semitism around the world is sickening.. and I absolutely condemn any islamaphobia as well. Only 2% of the world is Jewish. And it's not right to call for their existence to cease over a war they didn't start.

A rant on behalf of the mediators.,"For those attempting the seemingly impossible task of holding multiple thoughts about complex issues at the same time:

To preface, I am not Jewish, Muslim, Palestinian, or Israeli. I am invested in this conflict, however, for reasons I'd rather keep private.  I have worked on human rights campaigns for Palestinian statehood and against antisemitism.  I and other colleagues and friends of mine with similarly complex views on this war have been called both a zionist and a jew hater, a terrorist sympathizer and complicit in the genocide of Palestinians.  The rhetoric and rush to judgment around this conflict is at peak insanity, which is really saying something for a decades old conflict that seems to only bring out the worst in everyone.

It is possible to believe that both Israelis and Palestinians have legitimate claims to this land, that both the Israeli and Palestinian governments have committed grave injustices against one another, and regularly make decisions and use language that escalates tensions in the region, make peace less and less likely, and endanger their own people.

It is possible to both support Israel's right to defend itself and wage this war against Hamas and call for greater restraint and consideration for the humanitarian impact of bombarding civilian areas, and voice concern about how it will radicalize yet another generation of Palestinians to join militant islamist and *terrorist* organizations. It is possible to support Israel and abhor the Netanyahu government.

It is possible to both support the Palestinian struggle to overcome decades of occupation and mistreatment by Israel and stand firmly against Hamas.  They are not merely an ""armed resistance,"" and their tactics are illegitimate, barbaric, and cause deliberate and catastrophic harm to the people they claim to defend. There are no easy ways to defeat an enemy like Hamas.

It is possible to be skeptical of both the official Israeli government's and Hamas' narrative of this war.

It is also possible for those not directly involved in this conflict to not have a monomaniacal fixation on it at the expense of everything else going on in the world, one's personal relationships, and one's own mental health. This is the only geopolitical conflict in the world that seems to demand that everyone have an opinion on it. I'm beyond tired of the public pressure campaigns to pick sides and partake in cheap sloganeering. 

Not all of us have neatly defined allegiances and b/w views which can be easily unpacked without tons of context and caveats. I'm tired of the advocates of compassion, pragmatism, and suspended judgment being drowned out by the most extreme, ill-informed, and impulsive voices. We need more people who aren't singularly focused on proving others wrong.  We need more mediators.",35,zenmasterflashmobstr,2023-11-19 08:57:13,17yh6kj,,post,,israelpalestine

My great-grandfather was a freedom fighter who fought against Japanese rule during Japanese Colonial rule of Korea(1910-1945), and my grandparents suffered Japanese regime. I was taught how real freedom fighters should fight - avoiding civilian casualties, and targeting individuals who are actually responsible. Did Palestine and Hamas do it?

Shame on Palestine, shame on its people who approved such an indiscriminate way of resistance.

I strongly condemn their war crimes, but Israel had every right to fight back. This is a fact.",1,Imperialseal88,2023-11-19 05:33:10,k9sk60o,,comment,t3_17y2ts0,israelpalestine
"Criticize individuals, organizations, and governments, not whole ethnic groups","I think we would have much more productive conversations in this sub and in general about the Israel-Palestinian conflict if we self-imposed some discipline. It's okay to judge, criticize, condemn the actions if individuals, organizations, and governments, but we should not generalize to entire ethnic, religious, or national groups.

This is a skill that we all should have learned in kindergarten (to judge people for themselves, and not their identities), but it's something that we aren't the best at carrying into practice when it really counts.

If someone discusses what ""the Jews"" want, or ""the Israelis"", or 'the Zionists"", or ""the Palestinians"", or ""the Muslims"", or ""the Arabs"", the argument has already been lost. Israelis certainly don't agree amongst themselves about most things, nor do Palestinians. Even if you're saying you disagree with the 70% of a group that a poll suggests holds a particular opinion, express your disagreement with that 70%, and not the whole group. 

If you want to criticize people for celebrating after October 7 in the street, criticize the individuals who celebrated in the street, not all Palestinians. If you want to criticize settlement expansion, criticize the settler organizations who push for it and the government policies that enable it. 

All of these groups are incredibly diverse, internally divided, and composed of individuals who have their own perspectives, worldviews, and actions. If we impose this self-discipline when we discuss the conflict, I think we can really achieve some meaningful dialogue, even in this highly fraught and terrifying time.

Israeli Military Orders and the Occupation of Palestine,"Made this [quick little photo-set](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNaAxess/) of some of the current Military Orders in place since 1967 that keep both the West Bank and Gaza under military occupation and restrict the rights of the people who live there. 

The information relates to Military Orders: 

* 101 - ORDER CONCERNING PROHIBITION OF  
INCITEMENT AND HOSTILE PROPAGANDA
* 132 - ORDER CONCERNING TRYING OF  
JUVENILES
* 1651 - ORDER REGARDING SECURITY PROVISIONS
* 158 - ORDER CONCERNING AMENDMENT TO SUPERVISION OVER WATER LAW

A lot of this information is pretty hard to come by online, most of the resources have been archived or are solely in reports and law studies, but I’ve tried to provide as many sources as I could fit.  
Most of the text on the actual Orders comes from [JMCC’s book Israeli Military Orders in the Occupied Palestinian West Bank (1995)](http://www.jmcc.org/documents/JMCCIsraeli_military_orders.pdf).

Why is whataboutism so wrong?,"Hi all,

I had a irl conversation about the israel palestine thing (I work with Israeli people so it always comes up, lucky me). They were reading me the number of deaths, you know business as usual for this sub. I was curious and ask dude wait a second, why are you so pumped up about this conflict and not by let's say the yemen civil war? Or Sudan? What is the criteria you use for calculating the importance of conflicts?

It was brought to my attention that I was just diverting the topic, and doing what in English you'd call whataboutism. I admit I was bored by the convo so I may have redirected the topic, but I am curious to know: why is it an invalid response, in your opinion? Or why is it valid?

I see it as a way of showing that attacks, even terrible, with a huge toll, happens also in other parts of the world. That the world is complicated, and the area is a geopolitical mess, I'm not saying we should not talk about them too but please, tell me why this is so important to you. And why the others are not, and have never been for your whole life, while now this seems like a never before seen moment of tragedy. I'd be really curious to know this stuff, but if I try to ask I get a very defensive response",9,I_mean_bananas,2023-11-19 04:51:59,17ybvad,,post,,israelpalestine

,"Whataboutism is complicated. 

Sometimes it is a valid argument, and sometimes sit is not.

It is all about context.

I'll give an example of a valid use:

Argument: Annexation of territories acquired through war is never allowed

Whatabout: South Korea's annexation of part of North Korea, France's annexation of part of Germany, Holland's annexation of part of Germany, India's annexation of Goa, Daman, and Diu, etc.. Those have all been accepted.

This is valid because the argument directly refutes the claim by providing counterexamples.

That people protest the war in Gaza, but not other much larger conflicts is in of itself not a counterargument to any validity to the protests themselves, on the other hand if one wanted to compare the ***government*** silence to blatant massacres and ethnic cleansing committed by Turkey to the actions/words of the same governments on the Hamas-Isarel war then your Whataboutism would have validity.

We need to talk about this,"I wanted to make this post for a while now as I've seen a trend with the pro-Palestine side on this sub.

So when someone does a post complaining about [how exhausting being pro-Israeli](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17w5jog/standing_with_israel_is_mentally_exhausting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is, there are tonnes of comments saying ""free Palestine"", are just Palestinian flags, or say something along the lines of ""yeah it's hard to support a country that ethnically cleanses/commits genocides/is an apartheid state"". Some of those comments got replies asking why it's an apartheid state/ethnically cleansing/commits genocide, and the large majority didn't bother answering.

However, when posts specifically address the genocide/ethnic cleansing/apartheid claims or ask about the ceasefire requests, this isn't the case. There are very few pro-Palestine people who actually engage with the post. I found that on every such post, there are a few comments repeating the genocide claims and disappearing, quite a few comments saying things that were already addressed in the original post, and only one or two comments actually engaging in conversation and not disappearing when they get a response.

There are also a few comments on top of the comments that repeat the genocide claims and disappear of pro-Palestine people saying this sub is hugely biased towards Israel and is basically repeating Israeli propaganda so there's no point talking.

And I don't think that's the situation. When someone makes a post venting about how he feels, there are a lot of you there to attack him, but when people actually make arguments against you and try to have a conversation, you go silent.

,"Something I like to call:

Moral High Ground Ignorance

Imagine being pro choice, within reason. You believe a woman should have the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy during the first trimester. 

Now try explaining that to a pro-lifer who just wants to scream “BABY MURDER” and “PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION” in your face over and over again. 

They don’t actually want to look into the science, or examine the fact that a blastocyst is not the same as a baby, or hear about the ethics of forcing a child to carry a pregnancy to term, or rape victims, or consider the fact that banning abortion outright also leads to the ban of life saving procedures that have nothing to do with pregnancy. 

A pro lifer doesn’t need to consider any of the things that make abortion complicated. They can just say “Abortion is murder, I’m right, you’re wrong, shut up.” They can award themselves the moral high ground without ever educating themselves about the intricacies of the issue. 

So that’s the kind of frustration I feel as a Jewish person who supports a two state solution, with a personal belief in Israel’s right to exist. I know so much about the intricacies of the conflict. I’ve studied it for many years. 

But all that goes by the wayside because the anti-Israel crowd can just scream “ISRAEL IS A GENOCIDAL APARTHEID COLONIST WHITE SUPREMACIST STATE!

Do people actually want Palestine (which is currently run and represented by Hamas) to win?,"Sometimes I feel that some genuinely kind and well-meaning people don’t really understand just what a “win” for Palestine as it currently is means: an authoritarian and extremist-run group with a penchant for terrorism, violence and human rights abuses will be allowed to run even more rampant than it already is. We can argue all day about how Palestinians are not Hamas but they arecurrently represented by it and that is who will rule the area if it is “liberated.” Nothing about history or current attitudes toward Jews can lead anyone with even a modicum of sense to believe that a free Palestine will be a place where “Muslims, Jews and Christians can live in peace” as many supporters like to say rather than a repressive and violent regime that will go on a murderous rampage. Israel has many faults but it is a Western country with Western values.  So when push comes to shove and compromise proves impossible due to the other side’s violence, who do we actually want to win?

(This is a rhetorical question since this group leans much more toward being pro-Israeli but I’m truly curious whether some pro-Palestine people truly don’t understand what “freedom” will result in or genuinely support what Hamas stands for.

Why is no one calling for Hamas surrender?,"This is a geniune question and not in support of Israel or Hamas.

But I see people calling for a ceasefire but no one is calling for a surrender. Why?

If Hamas has exactly 0% chance of winning, what exactly would they accomplish with a ceasefire? In normal wars, people stop fighting when they know they are on death's door and there is no chance of winning. They surrender so that no more of their citizens or personnel die.

But instead they do not surrender. They sit there dying and calling for ceasefire.

Have they forgotten that surrender is an option? Are they that adamant to maintain control that they don't care how many people die? Is there a ""win or die"" religious cultural belief similar to what the Japanese use to have?

Outside of Gaza, people are concerned about too many civilians being killed and calling for a ceasefire, but not calling for surrender. Again, weird... Because why would one side with an overwhelming advantage ceasefire after being attacked first? Militarily speaking, they would continue to advance until surrender.

&#x200B;

So, surrender solves everything immediately.

Well, not everything. But it would allow the actual fighting to stop and lives to be saved, and then everyone can take a deep breath and reflect on what has happened, who did good, who did bad, etc. It at least brings us to the next step.

So again, why so much push for ceasfire, but no push for surrender? Is it about being martyrs and sending a message? What is the significance of a ceasefire vs just surrendering at this point?",132,redditjunkie875,2023-11-18 22:36:50,17y4nw2,,post,,israelhamaswar

Who is Sahar Shehadeh? Durham College student supporting October 7 massacre by Hamas,"\#AntiSemitic #Hamas #Israel Sahar Shehadeh is facing intense criticism on social media due to her support for Hamas and the October 7 massacre. She has been identified as a student in the advanced biotechnology program at Durham College.

A video of Sahar Shehadeh expressing support for Hamas and endorsing the October 7 massacre has gone viral on social media. In the video, she refers to the massacre as a historical event and expresses her support for Hamas, wishing for a recurrence of October 7.

[Sahar Shehadeh](https://reddit.com/link/17yainn/video/y66883imy41c1/player)

## Who is Sahar Shehadeh?

Sahar Shehadeh is a student enrolled in the advanced biotechnology program at Durham College. Following the circulation of the video, numerous users criticized her actions, condemning her support for Hamas and the October 7 massacre.

Reactions on social media varied, with one user calling for consequences from the college, stating, ""If a college doesn't expel individuals like this, all government funding should be immediately cut off."" Another user remarked on the impact on her career prospects.

One tweet expressed concern over rising anti-Semitic incidents globally, particularly following the October 7 tragedy and the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), incidents of anti-Semitism in the US increased by about 400% in the two weeks after the Hamas attack on Israel, with 312 recorded incidents between October 7 and October 23.

During this period, 99 incidents were directly linked to the conflict between Hamas and Israel. The U.S. Justice Department is closely monitoring the heightened threats against Muslims and Jews in response to escalating violence.

* **Palestinian officials and Medical staff says they received an Evacuation order and were threatened to leave at gunpoint (reported by Al-Jazeera)**

**Palestinian officials and the Israeli military offered conflicting versions about what prompted the mass exodus from al-Shifa hospital, AP reported.**

&#x200B;

# What Israel is saying:

&#x200B;

**IDF international spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Peter** Lerner denies ordering an evacuation of al Shifa hospital, but says the hospital's administrator asked for an evacuation corridor.

He claims people have been leaving, but those who cannot leave have remained in the hospital with medical staff.

Lerner says the IDF is carefully **operating in al Shifa** to maintain security, but claims there is evidence Hamas is operating there.

He also denies ordering anyone in Khan Younis to evacuate, but says **the south is safer for people.**

Lerner defends the suitability of the al Mawasi area for displaced civilians and says there is no time limit on ground operations within Gaza.

When asked how many civilian lives lost is too many for Israel, he objects and says there is no price on civilian life, but that the IDF needs to distinguish between civilians and terrorists.

# What Palestine is saying:

Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital has been evacuated after **Israeli forces allegedly ordered doctors, patients, and displaced people to leave the medical compound.**

**Medical sources claim that some individuals were forced to leave at gunpoint.**

The hospital, which had over 7,000 people, including critical patients, was under siege by Israeli troops for several days. The evacuation caused panic and fear among the hospital staff and patients. Many people left on foot, but those who couldn't move, such as amputees and critical patients, were forced to remain behind with a few medical staff. 

**The Palestinian Minister of Health called for international institutions to intervene and transfer the babies to hospitals in the occupied West Bank or Egypt.** The scenes outside the hospital during the evacuation were described as appalling, with dead bodies scattered on the road and homeless people left out in the open.

"Two Israeli  soldiers attack a Palestinian child with a dog, while a third soldier records it and laughs!",,184,nihilist_911,2023-11-19 20:44:46,17yto49,,post,,N_N_N
,"December 2014, 10 kilometres north of Hebron

The teenager in the video was a 16-year-old named Hamzeh Abu Hashem, he was arrested in December 2014 for throwing stones during confrontations with soldiers

The video was posted by a jew who was angry about the treatment of a minor and the use of dog. I think the guy who posted it was a former government worker or a member of Parliament who was angry about the use of dogs against a minor

Translation

Give it to him


Give it you son of a bitch

Give it


Who is a scardicat now


Who is the scardicat now


You son of a bitch

Fantastic



If I remember right these kids were rocking at one of the soldiers and hurt him badly. But don't quote me on it it's been almost 10 years. The story came out in March of 2015.

If I remember right the kid threw a rock and I think he hit a soldier in the face which knocked him out broke a bone and then started taunting the soldiers. These two soldiers got pissed that their friend got hurt and chased the kid down and this is what resulted.

Israel stopped using dogs in 2012 to neutralize Stone throwing kids ( supposedly) I think the two Soldiers got demoted or something, and the kid was treated in a hospital and got a three or six month sentence for putting that guy in the hospital

The kid ended up suing a Dutch company that supplied the dogs a few years later but I don't know if he won or not, but I do remember that they halted the export of dogs to Israel permanently after that.",54,tolerant_man,2023-11-20 00:16:49,k9vwvx1,,comment,t3_17yto49,N_N_N

Time to face the facts. Israel is not going anywhere.,"Frankly this has been bothering me quite a bit. Since October 7th, there is a new chorus of people (most of whom barely know 5% of the history of this region), who are joining in with “River to the sea” type energy. 

When someone says “Israel shouldn’t exist”, or “Israelis should go back to where they came from” - let’s be clear. Jews are from here. That is a stone cold fact.

Anyone bearing this philosophy is thinking way too simply about a conflict that is not simple. There are currently 4th & 5th generation Sabra Jews (for those that don’t know, meaning Jews born in Israel). Where are these people supposed to “go back to”? 

So if you are saying that I should go back to where I “came from” - I am not going “back” to Baghdad, where my grandparents were expelled from over half a century ago. I am staying put where I am, where I was born and raised. 

If your solution to the conflict is anything other than 1SS or 2SS, you are de facto asking for perpetual war, because you’re not willing to live next to me peacefully, you don’t acknowledge my right to be here, and I’m not going anywhere. If it’s perpetual war you want, that’s exactly what you will get, and you’ll keep coming out the loser. 

We must accept that in this conflict, Israelis (mostly) view 1948 as the liberation of our homeland. Palestinians (mostly) view it as a foreign colonizer. The thing is, decolonization generations after the fact is a war crime.

To add to Golda’s famous quotes, and TLDR: Only once we can all accept the CURRENT reality, and not view this conflict as if it were still 1948, that’s when we will make actual progress.",177,bkny88,2023-11-19 12:12:32,17ylc6q,Opinion,post,,israelpalestine

,"Suggest you peruse this poll conducted by Arab World for R&D, of Beit Hurzeit University, located in the WB, of Palestinian opinion from Nov 14.  Both Gazans and WB-ers were polled.

I don't like it, but it's always good to know what people genuinely think.

&#x200B;

* 59% extremely support the Hamas actions of Oct 7. 68% in the WB vs 47% in Gaza
* 75% have very/somewhat positive view of Hamas
* 86% have very/somewhat negative view of the PA
* Palestinians have negative views (very/somewhat) of almost every foreign actor: Hizballah 51%, negative, US 97%, Iran 63%, Turkey 63%, Egypt 85%, Jordan 85%, KSA 95%, UAE 95%, EU 92%, UN 90%, Red Cross 75%, Russia 54%, China 60%.
* The only actors viewed positively are Palestinian terrorist factions: Hamas, PIJ, Al Aqsa Brigade, Al Kassam Brigade
* One State Solution is supported by 5%
* Two State Solution is supported by 17% (slightly more support in Gaza than WB)
* ""A Palestinian state from the river to the sea"" supported by 75%.  (This is the original PLO demand for Israel's destruction.)
* 72% believe Palestine will emerge victorious from the war.  (Seems deluded to me, but there it is.)

What this suggests is that if peace with Palestinians comes, it will have to be imposed from the top down, bc Palestinian people don't want it.  It's not as bad as it sounds, though.  Arab neighbors' peace treaties with Israel have also generally been a creation of the ruling class rather than the Arab street, and yet have stood the test of time.

Ben Gurion did not intend to expel all the Arabs when Israel was created.,"The “nakba” would have likely never occurred if the 1947 partition plan was accepted. Here is the quote:

“In our state there will be non-Jews as well — and all of them will be equal citizens; equal in everything without any exception; that is: the state will be their state as well. ...The attitude of the Jewish State to its Arab citizens will be an important factor—though not the only one—in building good neighbourly relations with the Arab States. If the Arab citizen will feel at home in our state, and if his status will not be the least different from that of the Jew, and perhaps better than the status of the Arab in an Arab state, and if the state will help him in a truthful and dedicated way to reach the economic, social, and cultural level of the Jewish community, then Arab distrust will accordingly subside and a bridge to a Semitic, Jewish-Arab alliance, will be built...

“Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves … politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves… The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country. … Behind the terrorism \[by the Arabs\] is a movement, which though primitive is not devoid of idealism and self sacrifice.”

“We must do everything to insure they (the Palestinians) never do return.”  
David Ben-Gurion, in his diary, 18 July 1948, quoted in Michael Bar Zohar’s Ben-Gurion: the Armed Prophet, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 157.

Ben Gurion also warned in 1948: Assuring his fellow Zionists that Palestinians will never come back to their homes: “The old will die and the young will forget.”

“We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and Syria. The weak point is Lebanon, for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine. We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash the Arab Legion, eliminate Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us. We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and Sinai.”

Israel is more important to jews than Palestine is to Palestinians….?,"Spoke to a Jewish friend of mine recently and he was explaining to me that Israel is a safe haven for all of the Jews in the world. Since Jewish people were expelled from many countries, Israel is the only place on earth that is safe for them. He then said that Israel is the second safest place for Jews in the world after US, and only said it was second because they were in a war. Which is bizzare to me. 

If Israel gets destroyed and powers like Syria, Iran, Lebanon, Hamas, Hezbollah, etc all get their way, it seems like it would devastate Jewish people and their safety around the world.

On the flip side I spent some time speaking to a Muslim friend of mine, he said that if the Palestinian people leave, they would loose their homes and be separated from a place their ancestors lived in and not be allowed to return. 

It’s become pretty clear to me that both sides holding hands and living in peace will never happen. 

There’s 40 other Muslim countries and no other jewish country. If the Israeli occupation is so bad…why don’t Palestinians leave or make a concerted effort to live under Israel occupation in peace and cooperation. Israel is clearly way stronger and better at building a first world nation than anywhere else in the Middle East. 

My main stance is that the threat to the Jewish people is a bigger moral concern than the threat to the Palestinian people. Palestinians have the option of living peacefully or leaving. Israelis and Jews have no where to go.

Instead the Palestinians and every single Arab nation declare war on every Jew everywhere ( in 1948) and say they will go to war to prevent the creation of Israel. 

They have denied multiple two state offers since.

,"There is really no need for the Palestinians to live permanently under Israeli occupation. The Israelis don't want to govern the Palestinians. It's an enormous, expensive pain in the ass for them, and it's extremely dangerous, and they'd rather not do it. This is why they withdrew entirely from Gaza in 2005. They haven't been in Gaza for almost 20 years, and we all know how well that worked out.

The West Bank is more complicated because of the Israeli settlements, but a deal could be made. Even now, Israel has handed over a lot of governance to the Palestinian Authority. What the Israelis really want is to get away from these places, but they feel a need to stay because they're fearful of terrorism and militarization. The don't want another hostile group right on their border, because (if you look at a map), you'll see that the distance between the edge of the West Bank and the Mediterranean is about 12-15 miles. A military attack from the West Bank by a major military force would be a huge problem for Israel strategically.

But you are broadly correct that the Palestinians should focus on developing what they have instead of pursuing endless violence. In Gaza they get hundreds of millions of dollars annually from the US, the UN, Europe, Qatar and others. Unfortunately, they spend most of this money (or all of the money?) on... weapons. If they spent it on housing, hospitals, roadways, schools, infrastructure, economic development, etc., life would be much, much better. They can't seem to move on and accept that Israel isn't going anywhere.

Now that we have the complete chant, what does it mean?

This calls for the eradication of Israel. Take note that Palestinians don't want the death of Jews, just the elimination of Israel from Palestine. Palestinians doesn't have the resources to scale war with Israel. Maybe the Palestinians also cannot bear the conscience for killing innocent civilians resulting from the invasion to capture Israel.

Hamas is an organization created primarily to the eradication of Israel including all Jews within their reach. It will kill Jews in Palestine, in Israel, and If they have the means, Jews globally. Hamas is allegedly well funded by misallocating funds donated for the reconstruction of Gaza and allegedly receiving funds from other Muslim countries or allegedly other terror organizations.

I'm tired of all this,"I'm French-Israeli and I live in France, so maybe I'm not the best person to complain here because I don't actively suffer from the war right now, but I still wanted to share my experience.

My parents are both Israeli, but I was born in France and grew up there. My whole family is in Israel and I visit them regularly, so it's not like I have to connection to Israel. I am a Zionist, but I am also pretty left wing on this conflict. I am against the Israeli occupation, and I believe in a two state solution, I dream that one day there will be peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

I knew there was antisemitism and anti-Zionism in the world, after the war broke out on October 7th, I feel it now more than ever. And I don't only feel the hate against me, I see Israelis/jews hating of arabs, And I am honestly tired of all this.

I'm tired of all the hate, about the brainless, narrow minded hate. I see on social media people hating on both sides, with zero knowledge on the subject. Even people who do have a little bit of knowledge, are not willing to listen and to try seeing another perspective. Again, I see this from both sides.

I'm tired of people not believing me online when I say I'm Israeli and want peace and tolerance. Is that so surprising? Are people so pessimistic and think that tolerance cannot be achieved?

I'm tired of people generalizing and saying that all Israelis hate Palestinians and the other way round. People using ""Zionism"" to describe a racist movement that want to destroy Palestine. That is one example of the ignorance I see on social media. To be clear if people don't know this here, Zionism is a movement that has the sole goal of creating a Jewish state in their homeland, nothing more, nothing less. There are ultranationalist Zionists who really are racist and want to destroy Palestine, but that is not pure Zionism.

I'm tired of seeing antisemitism. Not anti-Zionism, antisemitism. I'm going to talk about my experience in France, well, because I live there. I saw antisemitic tags just near my home. There was a case where **kids**, **middle schoolers** chanted ""Fuck the jews, we are Nazis and we are proud"". It is the first time in my life where I'm a *little bit* more careful when I go outside. I try to not speak Hebrew when I'm on the phone, and I never say that I'm Israeli or a jew in public. I also see hate against muslims and arabs, I just can't really talk about it because I don't experience it, but I know it's there.

I'm tired of all this. I want to stay optimistic and think that there will be one day peace within our lifetime. I know racism and intolerance will never disappear, but peace within Israelis and Palestinians, maybe.

I want to know what others feel and think. Tell me, we can maybe have a discussion like that.

,"I've taken a step back, and ""touched grass"". My emotions on this topic are high due to personal connections.

But you are right, Oct 7th, has brought out a lot of people who seem to be perfectly willing to ignore reality, facts, and history to repeat their hatred now out loud, and feel justified in it.

I've joined this sub to see if reasonable discussion can be had. But I'm not sure given the apparent lack of moderation. I've seen some pretty brutal anti-antisemitism and hatred allowed to be posted. And the ""Just Asking Questions"" to mask their hatred is gross.

I'd like this to be a respectful discussion,"I live in Israel, I live right next to the west bank, and I'd feel safer there if not for some of the settlements. I agree that the west bank is a complex argument that needs to seriously be discussed. 
On the other side of that there's Gaza. It's fairly new, the government withdrew from there in the summer of 2005.
I've lived through some military and security issues here, on both sides. I see how some Palestinians suffer in silence and some commit horrific crimes. The government hasn't addressed the issue to the point of putting it's citizens in danger for ""the good name of Israel"" in my opinion. 
October 7th might not have been the worst day of my life, but it was for too many people. Since then we've been re-traumatized by horrific acts by very radical actions commited by hamas and other assorted terrorist organization's, and surrounding countries. 
I think we're all in pain and it feels so hard to process that this happened, we don't want to believe human beings like this exists anywhere, so we feel like we have to look away. 
I hope one day we can chill for a while, take a step back and try to understand what the hell is going on. 
In the third grade there was a girl who her cousin was kidnapped and killed by hamas along with another 2 young men. It scares the shit out of us, on both sides, around the world, try to understand that it's not just Palestinians and Israeli people are affected by it.

I want to understand recent Israel/Palestine conflict better,"Hello, it's been bothering me that I couldn't find honest to god ""centrist?"" opinion on this conflict.On one hand, we been hearing about Israel government pushing out Palestinians out of their homes, destroying them, blocking water wells and that is only the most recent cases I remember prior to conflict escalating. I've seen videos of Israel military personnel treating Palestinians like they are not even human. I've seen even a video of Palestinian being shot in the back after he walked away from a conflict (It was roughly a year ago, and video had no context of what happened there, I am not even sure if those were live rounds).

On the other hand, we had LOTS of Iron Dome videos in r/CombatFootage, where Israel cities were bombed with rockets, civilians killed etc. There were videos of Israel military personnel being killed with Sniper rifles, and even using rocks via those huge slingshots. Granted, most cases with slingshots never being able to do much, although I understand that it's a deadly weapon in case it does hit someone.

I completely understand why Palestinians are unhappy with how Israel government treating them, and why this conflict escalated (I think it was obvious that something would happen sooner or later), and I can understand why Israel military personnel treat Palestinians with hostility, considering the fact that they can be killed at any moment.

I personally fully support Palestinians, and my personal belief is that they should be free from Israel government control, and harassment. The war needs to end, and Palestinians need help rebuilding their homes.

What I however don't understand is, how can people choose to support Israel government, considering all that happened prior to recent terrorist attack, Palestinians being mistreated, homes destroyed, etc.And how can people genuinely support HAMAS after they committed terrorist act, where they massacred countless people in Israel, with one famous example being German citizen Shani Louk, whose corpse they paraded in Palestine, after breaking her knees.How can people still call them freedom fighters, and justify their actions by saying ""Well, Palestinians were mistreated for years"".

As if it's a good argument somehow? Would it be okay if black people who face racism in America banded up together to shoot up all those who did them wrong? Would it be ok, for a kid in Russia, who got bullied for years, to show up in school with a shotgun, to gun down his bullies? 

Is this really how low we will stoop as a society, to support Israel in destroying peoples homes, and people inside them, who refused to leave their homes or to support HAMAS in killing Israel citizens?

I only recently started  keeping up with Palestine/Israel conflict, and what I want to hear in this specific sub, is for opinions of people, who understand this conflict much deeper than me, or the teens who discovered propaganda on TikTok. I would love to know, why this conflict couldn't be stopped, before it even happened. Why are Palestinians and Israelis at each others throats in general. What was the specific breaking point.

I don't want to hear baseless claims from extremist sides from Israel or Palestine, but rather ""factual"" information that I could rely on, to form my own opinion, by hearing out both sides of the conflict. And by both sides I mean people who support Israel or Palestine in this specific conflict.",15,chuueeriies,2023-11-19 22:44:07,17yvfzo,Discussion,post,,israelpalestine
,"Israel would love to have nothing to do with the palestinians. Israel walked away from Gaza and made sure to also ethnically cleanse all the Jews. . Palestinians could have taken the victory in gaza and shown what they could do, what they could build.

they chose to attack Israel.   Israel would ignore the occasional rocket attack. Israel built a fence to stop the terrorist infiltrations. Israel developed iron dome to protect its citizens. Israel was trying very hard to not need to respond forcefully.

Similarly, in Judea-Samaria, Israel built a wall to keep out terrorists. Israel has tried multiple times to give palestinians a state of their own, and it is always rejected, or ignored.  Israel would not be shooting anyone if there were no palestinian terrorist attacks. Israel would not need to be so active if Abbas would actually impose order and not encourage terrorism.

Is Israel perfect? no.  do they generally strive to be moral and do better, yes. (although the current government is a little extreme in my opinion, this is a recent development and reaction to non-stop terrorism.)

It seems to me that the palestinians may claim to want a state, and it may even be true, but they don't want one if it also means Israel will still exist as a Jewish state. 

I would also ask you to research why other countries don't want any palestinians.  This is not just an Israel/palestinian thing, Israel is just the latest one that has issues with the palestinias, and Israel is the only one that has never taken extremely harsh measures like mass expulsion or murder.    This is important for understanding who Israel is dealing with. If Arab countries had issues with the palestnians as well, and those had nothing to do with Israel, than maybe the problem now also has nothing to do with Israel. 

personally, I would like to see a nice big wall built separating Israel and the palestinians. Israel would remove isolated settlement, annex the larger ones. Including Jerusalem.  I would like a total separation. no transportation into between Israel and palestine. no overflights. no water from Israel to palestine. No electricity from Israel to palestine. no palestinian access to Israeli ports. no palestinian access to israeli telecommunications. no palestinian access to Israel banking system.  A total disconnect.  If a palestinian wants to go to gaza from the WB, they will have to go the long way around e.g. via Jordan, then Egypt.    The first rock(et) fired/thrown over the wall will be considered an act of war, Israel will make this very clear - there will not be any second chances, or it was just a kid. Palestinians will need to actually show they can run a functional state.      What are the chances of this state surviving? What are the chances it will be a failed state? (I believe the failed state option is very high).  

Israel, as the stronger party gets to set these conditions. 

What the palestinians do behind their wall, what arrangements they make with jordan, or the rest of the world, what they do for commerce, or how they run their government will have nothing to do with israel.

,"This war is not against the Palestinians, it is against Hamas. I live in the south (not next to the border) and Oct 7th was the scariest day of my life. We had none stop rockets, and in between the sirens we started hearing stories from our friends that are closer to the border. Horrific massacre that I didn’t understand how a human being can participate in. We lost several people, and I know several families that their children are held by Hamas (youngest is 3). I can tell you more if you like. 
After that, one thing was clear- Hamas cannot exist anymore. 

Now, how can we do that? It is a common fact that Hamas uses underground tunnels under Gaza. The tunnels are heavily trapped and the area is filled with civilians. Hamas hides weapons and military equipment in sensitive civilian areas, like the 50 rockets in the scout centers, or the weapons and hostages bodies found in Al Shifa’s area. 
Going in without bombing the area first would give a huge advantage to Hamas. The IDF reported that the majority of the buildings that they entered were trapped. It means sending soldiers to their death. 
Instead, the strategy was to evacuate civilians to a safe area and cut supply to the north. The problem is that Hamas prevented people from evacuating, and even attacked their own people. 

The Palestinian are victims of both sides. Hamas is stealing from UNRWA, endangering kids by storing weapons in their area, and preventing them from getting into safety. 

I would like to hear your opinion, how could the IDF do things differently, while still achieving their goals?",1,MoonAmunet,2023-11-19 23:24:34,k9vrx2e,,comment,t3_17yvfzo,israelpalestine
,"The main reason there is confusion is because people are being led away from the true (main) reason there is a declaration of war and people are dying.

October 7.

That's it. That's really the reason we have a war in the Middle East. 

https://www.hamas-massacre.net

This is what they did to their civilian population.

Guess what the government would do in return? 

Then we have a war, as simple as that. 

Some people would argue that this didn't happen in a vacuum, etc. 

Well, you can not justify terrorism. Even if you are under occupation or whatever.

,"People sometimes want to bring up history and argue over who has a more “just” claim to the land, etc. I’m not sure how relevant the history is to the situation on the ground given that both Israel and the Palestinian Territories have relatively young populations. These are two groups of people who both have grievances and don’t really have anywhere else to go. They both grow up hearing about how the other side wants to kill them (and maybe even seeing bombs falling on them and/or their friends getting killed). I think it’s probably somewhat worse on the Palestinian side but this is present on both sides. Logically if you grow up in such an environment, however you feel about what’s going on, you are extremely unlikely to support the *other* side that wants to drive you off your land and/or kill you. Similarly, if you’re a Jew living in e.g. the US, you’re probably not going to support the people rioting all over the country shouting “Allahu Akbar” talking about how much they hate Jews. The fact that Palestinian civilians (many of whom repeatedly openly state that they want to kill you and celebrate in the streets when Jews are killed) are getting killed by the Israeli military probably isn’t going to change your mind. Presumably the Palestinian perspective on Hamas’s terrorist attacks is similar.

I don’t know what a “centrist” opinion would be other than “it’s two groups of people that really really can’t get along with each other.” It seems like most people have their reasons for supporting and/or identifying more strongly with one side or the other.",1,cubeeggs,2023-11-19 23:29:13,k9vsc5x,,comment,t3_17yvfzo,israelpalestine

Terror Tunnel Under Al Shifa,"After a long time claiming this is the case, the IDF published a video showing a terror tunnel right under Al Shifa hospital:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?si=znKV03GivMmUxtVB&v=27qIrZ23fkA&feature=youtu.be

In the video, you can see a drone going into the tunnel, goes down through what seems to me a staircase, then walks through the tunnel until it meets an explosive proof door with a shooting window. 

This is the smoking gun that proves that Hamas uses hospital as terror facilities. No hospital supposed to have such facilities. Or is it? Why should a medical facility have military looking tunnels?",12,MoonAmunet,2023-11-20 04:51:47,17z2ndw,,post,,israelpalestine

,"Sky News report 

“ According to Defence for Children International, a NGO (non-governmental organisation), 97 children have been killed in the West Bank in 2023, the majority of them in the last two months”

Palestinians in the West Bank are being increasingly squeezed beyond the Israeli checkpoints. It was difficult for a Sky News team to reach the Palestinian town of Tulkarm, but when they got there they met the Mahmeed family - who saw their 15-year-old son killed in the street.

It is two years since I was last in the West Bank, and today it is a different place.

Beyond the Israeli checkpoints guarding ever-expanding Jewish settlements, illegal in international law, is a Palestinian population more squeezed than ever before.

We pass shops shuttered, streets deserted and Palestinian communities cut off.

A huge new highway cuts through the landscape. It's a road for Israelis, linking Israel to the West Bank settlements.

We're trying to reach the Palestinian town of Tulkarm and it's hard going.

At one roadblock, we stop to talk to the Palestinians beyond.

""The Israelis closed it,"" the young man says. ""We have businesses everywhere here… we can't work. It has been closed for about 35 days.""

Then he looks beyond me and backs off quickly. Behind, the Israeli military has turned up.

“ They are killing children, all the children who were killed were like Taha, they went to buy things in the shops and rockets fell on them.

""And children, aged 10, 11, 14… and Taha was 15. Most of them are under 20.""

The shooting had happened at 3.31am, according to the time stamp on the video which Taha's sister shared with Sky News.

Another of Sarah's videos shows the Palestinian ambulance arriving. It is time-stamped 4.44am. That is an hour and 13 minutes after Taha was shot.

It is common for ambulances to be refused access for ""security reasons"". In this case it is unlikely it would have made any difference - one of the shots struck Taha in the head.”

I don’t know how this conflict can end,"I honestly feel this conflict may never end. The more I read about Israeli and Palestinian history, the more complex everything becomes and the harder it is to voice my opinion. Especially as this is land I have never visited.

I’m an American Jew, I’m always going to view the land as Israel. I didn’t grow up in a very religious household, and many times in my life I’ve tried to abandon my Jewish identity, but I can’t. 

A majority of the anti-Israel arguments like act as if Israeli history started in 1948. The truth is, Israeli history isn’t just thousands of years old, but predates any mention of the word ‘Palestine’ by over a thousand years. Nearly everywhere you go, there is archaeological evidence of Ancient Israel. It was never called Palestine before the Jews were displaced. After the Jews were displaced, the Jewish diaspora continued to hold on to many aspects of the language, tradition and other aspects of the culture that originated in ancient Israel. For over a thousands years, members of the Jewish diaspora have faced in the direction of the Jerusalem when praying. With all this continued history, telling Jews they can’t call the land Israel is preposterous. Given how committed Jews are to our culture and faith as well as the persecution Jews have faced around the world for thousands of years, I can never imagine a time where Jews give up on the name ‘Israel’, especially since that name is older than ‘Palestine’. The fact we were kicked out, but still held on to the culture and practices speaks volumes on why Jewish connection to the land of Israel is so important and undeniable.

While I view the reestablishing of Israel in 1948 and an inspiring story of strength and perseverance, I also can’t deny what it represents to many Palestinians. Especially recently with the bombings in Gaza, I worry the more Israel bombs and kill’s civilians, the harder it is for Palestinian to ever accept Israel, as they connection to the land is hundreds of years old. Even though Israel is older, the impact of Israel on Palestines is more immediate and I can imagine why someone living under such scrutiny would want to avenge their loved ones death and bring it back to Palestine.

I know people like to say “the land was so peaceful before 1948”. Read about Operation Atlas and the fact Palestinian leader Haj Amin al-Husseini was working with Hitler to wipe out the Jews. Not just in Palestine, but every single Jew in the world.

I don’t believe there will ever be a world where people believe it should be called Israel and I don’t believe there will be a world where people don’t believe it should be called Palestine.",8,CharlesIntheWoods,2023-11-20 00:39:19,17yxerc,,post,,israelhamaswar
,"It will have to be a sustained generational occupation. If Gaza is occupied by a coalition, and money and jobs are pumped in while weapons are kept out and radicals removed, in several generations once the children have known peace, they won’t want to fight anymore. The fighting has to stop period and there may be only one way to do that. Then cycle as it has been going on obviously dosnt work. If i’m a 12 year old indoctrinated into a violent religion and you kill my older brother, you just turned me into a future terrorist.",5,Knowitallkyle,2023-11-20 01:28:24,k9w4vmz,,comment,t3_17yxerc,israelhamaswar

,"You have to realize a few things about like 70% of the people parroting ""from the river to the sea"" and ""INTIFADA"":

They are TREND hoppers.

These are the zombified brain-dead always-glued-to-social-media people that have been jumping on every single cause in the last 5 years and as long as the cause earns them brownie points in the Oppression Olympics, they go whole hog. They don't actually GAF about anything that is going on. They watch the videos of the civilians, they learn some loose loose cherry picked history, and then they go all in for ""their side."" Every denial is just a case of fingers-in-ears denialism that re-certifies their righteousness. IT's the EXACT same thing with Trump supporters (who supposedly these people hate) where his support gets stronger with every indictment and every new scrap of irrefutable proof that he is a garbage human being.

Their whole purpose seems to be to dwell in a world where the world is split cleanly into ""victims"" and ""colonizers."" If you are white or look white? Uh oh...you might be a colonizer. Better be gay, a woman, poor, or have something else sad about you like you're homeless or addicted to drugs or something in order to be on the side that they give a c*** about. 

It's the whole reason why you have grown supposedly mature adults having revelations that known terrorists like Osama Bin Laden were ""actually right"" to have killed tens of thousands of innocents, when the truth is that the truth is a lot more complicated than that and that no innocent people should become pawns of some stupid holy war. 

I am really really really sick and tired of having to hear these self-righteous people on my instagram feed, on my facebook feed, etc. They seem to enjoy both being victims, and looking for new ""victims"" to rally around so that they never lose their membership in the victim club. 

The Israeli and Palestinian conflict is incredibly complex. It's not good that Israel has been killing Palestinian civilians, and any sane rational personal should be heartbroken for the families and innocents that have been wiped out. But to turn around and use that to say Israel shouldn't exist, Israelis should just go back to whatever country they came from, etc....is madness.

All credit for the above links and comment goes to ThebesAndSound from the news reddit. No one pro Palestinian should gaslight again. This is irrefutable, and undeniable. I am sick and tired of all this gaslighting and mental gymnastics, and all this parroting of ""hasbara, Israeli propaganda"" open your eyes people, this conflict isn't as simple as ""oppressed"" and ""oppressor"". There has been atrocities committed by BOTH SIDES, and if we want peace ALL pro Palestinians and Pro Israeli's should agree that HAMAS, for the good of Palestinians, and Israeli's need to be wiped out to the last man.

No one who is pro palestinian should be supporting Hamas, and everyone who claims they are ""resistance fighters"" are mistaken, if Hamas targeted military installations on October 7th then I wouldn't feel so harsh towards them, even if Israelis civilian's were killed in the crossfire, but the fact that they deliberately and intentionally targeted civilians is inexcusable. The biggest obstacle to peace in the Levant is Hamas, Hamas even killed over 1000 of their own people during and after the Fatah Hamas conflict in Gaza. There is footage of them throwing their own people off roofs simply for supporting Fatah, who Hamas deemed as not being as ""Islamic"" and non secular as they should be.

If you are pro palestinian, please think clearly. The people of Gaza deserve better than Hamas, the Gazans and Israelis' have one thing in common; Hamas are the enemies of both.

I agree with you in that there should be investigations during and after any war and there needs to be consequences if there are war crimes. I also agree with you that innocent civilians should never be hurt and I grieve for those caught in this horrendous war.

Here is where we may diverge, my view of Palestinian deaths include Hamas accountability and they will not stop. 
My issue is in regards to the incredibly biased narrative.

IDF has put out far more than 4 million texts, phone calls, brochures for evacuation. We also know that Hamas blocked the routes out of Northern Gaza and even shot and killed Palestinians trying to go south. That is a fact. We now see loads of videos where we see evidence of Hamas embedding themselves in schools and hospitals. Such as Al Shifa, which has been known by the UN since 2014 as being used by Hamas’s headquarters as they used it when they were fighting Fatah but you have to search for that info. 

We also know that Hamas has sent thousands of rockets into Israel And hit an Israeli hospital, not discussed. We also know that 30% of its rockets don’t get to where they’re supposed to go and fall back on Palestinian infrastructure, not discussed. We also know it takes fuel to run those rockets, never mentioned. We also know that Hamas has distorted and outright lied consistently and they are the only origin of information, so I am reserving my judgement on swallowing whole their facts and figures. 

We also know, that the men who ran this massacre, lacked so much humanity that they not only raped women but also dismembered them, go pro’d it, shared it on FB and danced with glee celebrating. Many killed were not even Jewish. 
These are the people who have ruled Palestine for 20 years. Imagine the propaganda embedded in the society. We also know that in 2016 300 million a year was being paid to families of Palestinians who committed terrorist act. These are lifetime payments and seen as incentives to terror. It still goes on today. We know that Hamas Leaders have billions in their bank accounts, many safely residing in Qatar. Treaties for peace would mean giving up a lot of money. We also know that they planned this massacre for about two years and although they could build 300 miles of tunnel that they do not open up to Palestinian civilians for cover (no one considers that), they never thought once to create bomb shelters or a plan for Palestinian safety. We also know that much humanitarian aid that was supposed to go to Palestinians went to Hamas (that has been proven).
In 2005, 9000 settlers were removed from Gaza and Jewish bodies were dug up from the ground and removed from Gaza for peace. For one year, it looks like there was going to be peace. No air and water sanctions at the time. Then came Hamas, and thousands of rockets came flying into Israel along with many suicide bombers. This was before the wall or iron dome. 
The Hamas charter is to annihilate all Jews. I want you to give me one example where Hamas has agreed to peace or even indicated that they wanted it. Remember there was a cease fire before 7th October. 
And I will ask you, when on party doesn’t want peace, how will you obtain it? give me a solution? Mine would be to put pressure on Iran and Qatar to stop funding them because if they are cut off financially that might work but I don’t think that will happen because they don’t want Israel to have an alliance with Saudi Arabia nor do they want them to be competitive in the oil market. That is the real reason for the massacre.",41,Susue23,2023-11-20 09:26:58,17z8v6a,,post,,israelpalestine

,"“Proportional response” in war is BS invented by western liberals. This is a new invention inspired by sport tournaments. Both sides have to be equal in weight. Each side is allowed one hit, then it’s the other player turn. Nothing in real life works like that and definitely not war.  

However the current war in Gaza is different from devious battles that took place before. It’s not a kind of retaliation. It’s not about destroying X buildings, weapon stockpiles and tunnels. It’s about removing Hamas from power…. 

After many years, Israel finally concluded that as long as Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, life in Israel is impossible. The only solution is to uproot it. 

The big question is if that goal is practical. Can it be achieved? At this time nobody can say for sure. We’ll know better in a few months.",1,mikeber55,2023-11-20 19:43:18,k9zvdm4,,comment,t3_17z8v6a,israelpalestine
,"I can guarantee that Israel will never have war crimes issues. 

There are lots of videos from Hamas that Hamas themeselves uploaded that they are in residential houses while wearing ""civillians clothes"" while attacking IDF with rpg and ak47. 

There also videos of Palestines complaining to Hamas that they keep ""mixing themselves to civillians.""

There are videos of tunnels, terrorist facilities, rocket launcher in hospital, school and residential areas.

There are videos of Hamas ""trained children"" and attacking IDF and commited terrorism to civillians Jews. There are also lots of videos that children to old men in ""civillian clothes"" used sling shot to attack IDF. Sling shot can kill even a cow in a single hit. Thats still a weapon for killing. 

There are also interrogation videos of Hamas ""admitted"" that they use ""ambulance"" to transport weapons and terrorist, use of human shields, used of residential, hospital and school as terrorist facilities, rocket launchers and tunnels. 

According to survey in Gaza and WB citizens they also support Hamas and gladly celebrated Hamas massacre genocidal terrorism to Israel on 10/7. As a proof too, the mob in Gaza be it old, children and women attacked the hostages head with steel pipes while being paraded. These mobs attacks Jews and IDF on the spot in warzone or not.

Pro-Israel Perspective: Israel needs to get it together in the West Bank,"I’m pretty balanced but definitely tilt pro-Israel. I always was partial to Palestine most of my life as they are the underdog and I’m a liberal so I always am drawn to the underdog. After the October 7th terrorist attack, and my general disgust for Islamic extremism, I have been solidly pro-Israel. I believe Hamas needs to be eliminated and I don’t favor a ceasefire.

Now I say all this because I want both sides to understand where I’m coming from. I’m not an Israel loving zealot on one hand and on the other I want Israeli’s to recognize I say this with love and not animosity. Here we go: The government you continue to elect, that being the far-right Netanyahu government has a big part of the blame for where things are these days and many Israeli re-elect Likud knowing what they stand for. Most importantly, the terrorism and criminality from Israeli settlers in the West Bank is an outrage on any basic moral level. You cannot treat people this way and expect them not to kill you the first chance they get. None of this is to excuse terrorism. But let’s get real here. This is basic action-reaction. These extremist settlers either have a death wish or feel they can act with impunity due to the backing of the government and I think it’s the latter. President Biden is now taking action against Israeli settlers involved in violence by sanctioning them personally and any organizations affiliated with them. It shouldn’t be up to the USA to discipline these people but it seems Israel isn’t doing enough. 

I will link an article that came out in the New Yorker recently. Any moral person will react with disgust toward the woman featured. She’s a notorious Israeli extremist settler, Daniela Weiss, and her mindset is represented among this current Israeli government. Ending these actions will be a major step toward the better future for Israel and Palestinians.

,"I generally tilt towards Israel as well, but yeah the stuff in the West Bank isn’t okay and makes any debate about the conflict a lot more challenging because it inevitably comes back to the well documented wrongs and atrocities committed by settlers and on occasion the military, there. 

If Israeli’s want Israel to stay a democratic Jewish state and at the same time *not* an actual apartheid state then there needs to be a two-state solution—which the Palestinian state would mainly consist of the West Bank. And continuously expanding settlements filled with ever increasing amounts of settlers is antithetic to this.

Lack of differing opinions on this subreddit,"I originally came to this subreddit a few days after the Oct 7 attacks in search of the truth and discussions about the events going on in Israel/Palestine. Personally, I am a staunch supporter of Israel and believe they are fighting a just war against the terrorists that butchered their people. However, I still believe that discussion is the best way to come to some consensus and understanding about the situation.  In the beginning, I read comments and views coming from either side of the aisle in almost every post here. But after a month I started to notice a decrease in actual discussions and an increasing polarity between sides. Which defeats the whole purpose of r/IsraelPalestine

I recently visited r/palestine and I saw post after post praising Hamas ""resistance"" fighters and almost every comment siding with Hamas. Seriously, it's not like they denounce Hamas and support the right of Palestinians to live and self-determination, they actively support and cheer terrorists. Not a single post about the evidence coming out of Al-Shifa or talking about the corruption within the PLO and Hamas leadership, it's truly an echo chamber over there. the scariest part of it all is that r/palestine has more than double the number of members that this sub has and nearly every post, comment, and idea there is not rooted in facts or evidence, just emotions from all the horrific injuries caught on camera on the ground in Gaza that they actively post.

,"Agreed.

I discuss the ontological and metaphysical aspects of the conflict as much as I can. These aspects need to be understood for people to understand what motivates the sides of this conflict, and why it is never-ending.

Of course, war crimes are never acceptable, but both sides have valid motivations to fight. Ideas like ""justice,"" are misused and misunderstood as uniform concepts for everyone.

Conflict is not all physical, it's metaphysical as well. It's a battle of ideals, morality and justice. Physical responses to a conflict only solves physical aspects, but the metaphysical aspects (i.e. ideals, revenge and justice) remain. A conflict is not ended through physical force but through the dismantling of motivational factors.

Hamas is most definitely a barrier to resolution and a motivating factor in this conflict, primarily with their attacks on Israel, thus part of the dismantling of motivation means removing Hamas. However, HAMAS IS NOT THE ALL-ENCOMPASSING CONFLICT between Palestinians and Israelis. Even Hamas had its motivations, as does the growing support for Armed resistance against the occupation in the West Bank.

As I said, the conflict ends by diminishing motivational factors. Here are a few:

* Hamas terrorist acts
* Blockade of Gaza
* Corruption in Palestinian politics
* Split between Gaza and the West Bank for Palestinian representation
* Israeli occupation of the West Bank and colonial settlement agenda
* Failure of Israel in the modern day (and Palestine in past) to negotiate the creation of a uniform sovereign Palestinian state
* Israeli extreme right-wing political agenda

“The Israelis are so sure about the location of the Hamas bunker, however, not because they are trying to score propaganda points, or because it has been repeatedly mentioned in passing by Western reporters—but because they built it. Back in 1983, when Israel still ruled Gaza, they built a secure underground operating room and tunnel network beneath Shifa hospital—which is one among several reasons why Israeli security sources are so sure that there is a main Hamas command bunker in or around the large cement basement beneath the area of Building 2 of the Hospital, which reporters are obviously prohibited from entering.”",13,momo88852,2023-11-20 15:47:58,k9zchi0,,comment,t3_17z42cc,AskMiddleEast

Pro-Hamas Demonstrators Shut Down California Democratic Convention," A large group of pro-Hamas demonstrators shut down the California Democratic Party’s convention in Sacramento on Saturday after invading the convention center and shouting in support of violent Palestinian “resistance” against Israel. 

[https://twitter.com/shakethegate/status/1726105092338917571](https://twitter.com/shakethegate/status/1726105092338917571)

 The *Sacramento Bee* [reported](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/article282018228.html): 

 

>While protesters disrupted speeches inside the center, other protesters stood outside of the convention center with hundreds of children’s shoes, representing young people killed in Gaza, waving Palestinian flags and holding signs that read, ‘Stop U.S. Aid for Genocide.’”  
…  
Around 5:40pm, a group of those protesters marched into the convention center, waving flags, beating drums, and chanting as they went up the escalator to protest outside the voting rooms, which were empty at the time.  
“Resistance is justified when people are occupied,” they chanted.  
…  
Protesters remained inside the building’s West Lobby. After over an hour of delegates being unable to cast votes, many delegates left the building. Groups expressed frustration at being prevented from voting. The protesters remained.

Gaza had not been “occupied” since Israel’s complete withdrawal in 2005. The October 7 terror attack, in which Hamas murdered at least 1,200 Israelis, triggered an Israeli response whose goal is to destroy the terror organization and end the threat it poses.

The intentional disruption of democratic processes is commonly referred to by Democrats as an “insurrection,” at least with reference to the Capitol riot of January 6.

Governor Gavin Newsom (D) [visited](https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2023/10/20/gavin-newsom-meets-with-israeli-victims-of-hamas-terror/) Israeli victims of Hamas terror last month, and offered unequivocal support for the Jewish state.

 

His party, however, is deeply divided over the issue.

Maher: The Israeli Arabs Living in the Area ‘From the River to the Sea’ Prefer Israel over Hamas," 

During the “Overtime” segment of his HBO show “Real Time” that aired on CNN on Friday, comedian and host Bill Maher noted that the Israeli Arabs who live in the area “from the river to the sea” don’t agree with Hamas and prefer living in Israel over being under the authority of a terrorist group.

Former DNC Chair Donna Brazille stated that “We must condemn those who are marching saying that what Hamas did on that horrific day was right. We should immediately call for Hamas to release the hostages.”

 Maher responded that people are calling for it and demanding it, and that’s why Israel is fighting Hamas. 

 

Brazille responded, “I’m talking about the people who are protesting, they’re protesting and they’re saying, leave Hamas alone. And I’m like, no, Hamas started this.”

Maher then added, “It’s so interesting, they did a poll of the people who live in the area \[in the words of\] the saying from the river to the sea, in other words, Israeli Arabs, they don’t want to live under Hamas. 77% of them said, no thanks. We’re living in Israel. It’s way better than living under a terrorist group. Why don’t you teach that at college?”",22,Lrrr_Omicronian,2023-11-20 10:36:54,17zaghw,,post,,israelhamaswar

Israel releases footage of “Hamas tunnels”,"
Editors note for context: my old account was deleted because I was getting threats but I’m still gonna post

**Note: this is a relatively new story, more info will be added as more information is released**

&#x200B;

**Summary:**

The Israeli Defence Forces and Shin Bet security agency have [released footage](https://x.com/TwoSides_News/status/1726312978893480295?s=20) of a 55-metre tunnel they say is used by Hamas beneath Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa. The IDF says that the footage is ""more proof"" that Hamas is using patients as ""human shields"".

""The tunnel entrance contains various defense mechanisms, such as a blast-proof door and a firing hole"", says the IDF on their [X post](https://x.com/IDF/status/1726284807351472556?s=20).

**The IDF has said that Hamas has a command centre beneath the hospital, which has been denied by Hamas and hospital staff.**

**The IDF says the findings prove that buildings in the hospital complex are used as infrastructure for terror activity**.

The IDF and Shin Bet say they are continuing to operate at Shifa to expose the tunnel network in the area.

,"Beside the stairs, which are dug into ROCK and subsequebtly look similar, those bunkers look little alike.

One's yellow, the other is white. The rooms shown are different and the overall layout seems different.

If you've got some footage to show that Israel faked the tunnel video and used footage from Swedish bunkers, then cut to the footage that shows the same rooms and the same floors. Not some vague look-alikes to convince guilible people.


And miltaries have used tunnels since ages. A battle between Rome and Jews was decided after Jewish sappers dug under their wall to sabotage Roman siege engines. The siege entine collapsed and Rome was ready to retreat until the tunnels collapsed and took a part of the wall with them. Rome then sacked the city, iirc.

But that's VASTLY different from 'I dig tunnels into civilian homes and hospitals to discourage counter fire. And if the enemy does fire on those places, which now effectively lost protection under the rules of war, I start a media campaign to show the 'barbaric' nature of my enemies.'",16,lil_sh_t,2023-11-20 22:48:22,ka08hmd,,comment,t3_17zmf88,N_N_N

,"The government, mostly, is supporting Israel because they are a strategically placed ally. They are a great place to have bases and weapons incase a war breaks out or if we need to do more counter terrorism. They are also right next to the suez canal which is obviously very important to be able to control and protect. Also, having a strong military power able to fight wars without having to he involved directly ourself is strategically smart too, like with the west using Ukraine to fight Russia (not that we shouldn't have supported Ukraine, just that our governments reasoning is more strategic than just wanting to ""help out"". One thing that could change this is if public opinion changes enough to where the government tells Israel it has to change what it's doing and/or stop. Also, even though Israel won't admit it, they have nuclear weapons, and we don't want those to fall into Iran's or Syria's or Saudi Arabia's or Egypt's hands, let alone any terrorist or separatist groups. I'm not saying that we are doing the right thing here, we should definitely be being more critical of what Israel is doing and not just blindly giving weapons and funds, but we do have reasons to be on their ""side"". The angle of it being because they are Jewish and we are mainly Christian is from political propaganda to convince the public to support our efforts, like telling the public to support Britain in WW2 because they are similar to us culturally and to save them from tyranny, when we really were helping mainly because we didn't trust the Germans or the Japanese, and to a lesser extent because they were our ally, even though at first we only supported them with supplies. Or, when the government/politicians said that we needed to support South Korea in the Korean War to save them from ""Communist Tyranny"", when the South Korean Government was just as tyrranical at the time, just not Communist. Of course, they are democratic and free now, I'm talking about during the Korean War. Not that it's bad to support Jews ofcourse, I'm just saying that's not the actual reason, it's just one of the reasons used to convince the public. Those reasons are easier to explain and sway the public with than strategic reasons.",2,wolfthenate,2023-11-21 14:07:01,ka3xrh7,,comment,t1_ka3hcol,N_N_N

,"They're always going to be held to a higher standard because the world is not rational about this conflict.  All the death and destruction in the Middle East but they're uniquely focused on Israel because Jews.  UN refuses to condemn the October 7th Hamas attack where terrorists murdered children with glee but will condemn Israel on a regular basis.    Just think about how absurd that is.

It's a pride thing for Muslims.  If they once controlled the land, it's an insult for anyone else to live there, especially Jews.  That's the reason why a two-state solution has never worked.  

You either have one side who hates the Jews, or the other who fundamentally misunderstands that the conflict is not about land but ideology.  Western leftists ascribe rational thought to religious zealots when they're not rational people.  If they were rational people, they wouldn't be building tunnels, they would be building civilian infrastructure.  So sad that they'd rather fight than have a future.

For anyone who spouts about taking back all of Israel, it's never going to happen.  You are never going to defeat an advanced nuclear-armed nation like Israel.  Compromise or be miserable forever.

"Did the IDF show ""just"" a calendar in the Al Rantisi hospital basement?","Last week, the IDF posted a video from the basement of the Al Rantisi hospital, showing multiple pieces of physical evidence that show that it looks like it was used to hold hostages. In the subsequent attempt to discredit the entirety of the video, anti-Israel voices quickly pointed out an obvious mistake Hagari made when showing the camera around, misinterpreting the hand-written calendar in Arabic as being a guard roster for the hostages, instead of just a calendar titled with the name of the war and days marked off from 10/7 through 11/3 (a few days before the IDF entered there). What they don't note is that Hagari corrected himself when presenting the video to the press, **before** the original video with the mistake was published.

When there is an insistence on nitpicking the minutiae of an event rather than recognizing an honest mistake, *it is clear that the intention is not to find the truth, but rather an attempt to discredit the entire narrative*. For example, the ""40 beheaded babies"" issue was based on [this report](https://twitter.com/i24NEWS_EN/status/1711697093151056355), when the reporter mentions 40 murdered children in Kfar Aza, including beheading/s, which was then misreported by some international sensationalist outlets as ""40 beheaded babies"" - a clear case of bad second-hand reporting. But the anti-Israel approach seems to be to split hairs ""technically some of their heads were still attached, some news outlets misreported this and had to backtrack, so therefore it's all one big lie and no babies were killed or beheaded"". This is despite subsequent confirmation from the non-governmental organizations collecting the bodies that there were indeed multiple beheaded babies.

""Little kids, cut up in pieces...I will never forget the scene of seeing little babies, just laying there on the floor, and we were trying to figure out whose head belongs to which child."" ""I was crying for 5 days straight."" \[[Interview 1](https://youtu.be/ssiiZW9e6xw?si=yDWhB7b_umX9-PNh&t=85) | [Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKNPz51lTig&t=1965s) by head of United Hatzalah\]

**Back to the calendar, there are 3 relevant videos, let's go through them in chronological order:**

1. In the [original walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/rLp84A6TBJ0?si=QVwO_D_zbBv6d6j9&t=330) \[Published to IDF official channels November 13; X upload time (UTC) 20:55; Youtube upload time (UTC): 21:03\], he says:

>In this room, there is a list. This list, in Arabic, in Arabic, this list says ""We are in our operation, the operation against Israel, started in the 7th of October. This is a guardian list, where every terrorist writes his name, and every terrorist - eh eh - has his own shift, guarding the people that were here.

2. In the [video of the walkthrough with CNN](https://youtu.be/4zyNJmEVnpk?si=F-adutVff6GGoNi7&t=3841), he says:

>(Hagari) This is a guarding list, every terrorist has his own shift. (CNN narrator) In this room, he says, a guard list, that begins October 7th, ends November 3rd, not long before the hospital was evacuated.

3. In the [press presentation video](https://youtu.be/2EuSxHv-7VQ?si=J3sFk3VLbPdLoJ8i&t=656) when he shows and explains scenes from the original IDF walkthrough video \[published by i24 News November 13; Youtube upload time (UTC): 19:57\], he says:

>And there there is this list, with days, marks the days from the 7th of October, and has the name that Hamas gave to the operation, Operation of Al Aqsa, of the mosque of Al Aqsa. Has the dates, the numbers of the days, that followed \[passed?\] by; I don't know exactly what that indicates, when did they left\[sic\] this area

**My analysis:** It does seem like he originally misunderstood the list to be a guard shift list, and also presented it to CNN as such.  By the time he gave the press presentation, he presented it correctly. Important to note that the press release with the corrected interpretation of the calendar was published to YouTube **before** the IDF uploaded the original walkthrough video. That means that the correction came from within their ranks. However for some reason they still published the ""raw footage"" without cutting out that mistake. Their [subsequent post on X](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1724245759174791626) also has the corrected version.",32,posef770,2023-11-21 04:43:03,17zu5x8,,post,,israelpalestine

Rant: Pinkwashing is a lie,"Everytime the Israel-Palestine conflict is in the news, there's the same story: Gay people are asked whom they support in the conflict, and most (around 80%) answer they support Israel. The reason: ""Israel is supportive of gay rights, so it seems natural we support them!""

The pro-Palestine side, not being able to accept anyone supporting Israel, drop the pinkwashing arguement. ""You guys are so easily deceived. Israel doesn't give two sh\*ts about LGBT rights. It's just trying to distract from its human rights abuses by *pretending* it's gay friendly"". Apparently all said in an attempt to have us switch sides

But as a gay man, who has actually been to Israel, I'd like to seize the oppertunity and disagree: Anyone argueing ""pinkwashing"" is being deceiptive, and today I'm going to explain why.

First of all, it doesn't matter how much Israel *advertises* itself as gay friendly. You can't deny the fact that it simply *is* the most gay friendly country in the middle east. By a long shot. Most Palestinians want to destroy Israel, whether through military action, or by enforcing a right of return to Israel (which would make the country cede in its current form). This would mean the literally only country in the Middle East that grants us any form of rights would disappear. How do you expect anyone with just a bit of solidarity to support this?

Second: However it choses to advertise itself, the LGBT rights are still there. All activity has been legal since 1988, long before it was mainstream and they could have used it to ""distract"" from anything.

And I can pin point the exact reason why this is the case: Israel respects LGBT rights, simply because it respects human rights as a whole. Women, ethnic minorities, and more all see their rights respected. And although I don't want to downplay the struggles they face, even the Israeli Arab fare way better than anywhere else in the Middle East.

But of course, an Israel that respects human rights doesn't fit its enemies agenda. Because if they didn't have a human rights abuser as an enemy, they'd have to admit that there *might* be legit reasons that Gaza must be blocked (rocket attacks), that there must be walls and check-points accross the West Bank (suicide attacks), and that the occupation must continue (many Palestinians are violent).

So that's how we end up with lies like ""pinkwashing"". To downplay the fact that Palestinians aren't as harmless as they are made out to be, and their enemy is a human right respecting state. That way, things will fit their narrative. And imho, this is the *true propaganda*. Not what Israel is doing.

And hey, I'm not even denying the fact that Israel does advertise itself as gay friendly. But this is more like: ""We respects human rights, and abuses is not what we're about, even if we have adopt a hard stance with our enemies (who are literally trying to destroy us)"". In no way is this to wash away the Palestinian struggle.

But imho, the worst part are the half-facts people use as ""proof"" that Israel isn't as gay friendly as it appears, namely that A) discrimination still exists, and B) same-sex marriage isn't legal (spoiler alert: it is). Both extremely dishonest arguements. 

The first one because you could extend this to any country. In big cities, you'll find acceptance, while on the country side, you'll find less of that. Also, religious people are less accepting, while secular people are more so, etc. Israel is no different, where Tel Aviv, Haifa and maybe (turning five blind eyes) Jerusalem are accepting, while the more rural places aren't so much so.

The second one because it simplifies a complex issue down to a simple conclusion, namely that ""Straight marriage is performed, gay marriage is not"". Note that i use the word ""performed"". That's because civil marriage as a whole is not ""performed"", only ""recongized"" in the country. You can have it recognized, either when it was performed by a religious authority, or performed abroad. And guess what? In the latter case any marriage is recognized, even same-sex marriages. So technically, marriage is already equal in the country. A fact that is commonly ommited in discussions.

Sure, you could still argue it's an LGBT issue of sorts, because straight couples at least have a chance of being married in the country (when they share a religion), and have less distance to cover than gay couples (who'd have to fly to central Europe to get married, not to Cyprus as straight couples). But realistically, that's a problem with a lack of seperation of church and state. not an LGBT issue. I can guarantee you, once civil marriage will be performed, gay marriage will become legal along with it. 

\--------------

So yeah, long story short: I don't buy into the queer washing allegations. It seems like just another misinformation campaign launched by the Palestinian side to win the ""PR war"" against Israel. In particular an attempt to sway gay supporters. But first and foremost, to paint is as a human rights abuser.",39,AndrewBaiIey,2023-11-21 09:23:55,1800xf3,Opinion,post,,israelpalestine

Iron dome protecting Palestinians more than Israelis,"I hear many pro-Palestinians using the point that the iron dome is not fair. That it protects only Israelis. 
First, Palestinians could have focused on building protection for their citizens. Instead, they made tunnels only for Hamas. 

But. Now to the main point: why Iron was also better for the Palestinians.
1. Without the iron dome, Israel would have to be much more aggressive from the start, which means years ago.
2. Without an iron dome, the way to fight rocket launchers is multiple artillery and air strikes to the area from which the rockets came.

Overall, these two points would mean that without an iron dome, Israel would have to be much more aggressive against Palestinians and rockets coming from Gaza, resulting in many more lost lives.",32,EducatorRelevant885,2023-11-21 08:02:06,17zyvrd,,post,,israelpalestine

Let's step outside the echo chamber for a moment,"I think most of us can reasonably agree on this much: 1) we all function within digital echo chambers that perpetuate the opinions we already have 
2) for any claimed fact on this subject, from either side, scores of videos, articles, pictures and other media can be provided as purported evidence to back the claim 
3) neither of the above helps create productive discussion between opposing sides 
4) therefore, opinions are further entrenched, and noone has space to change their mind 

So, with the points above as a given, I would like to propose the following: 

Everything that has already happened up until this moment, has already happened. No amount of fury, pain or misery can change events that have already taken place. 

Now that we accept this- how can we move forward, today? 

In the present moment, Israel is bombing Gaza. 
This is undisputed, yes? 

In the present moment, human beings are dying in Gaza, yes? Some of you say deserved, some of you say not. Let's not get into that now.

,"I feel like there's a misconception as to why Israel is bombing Gaza. People thought they were bombing North Gaza solely to kill Hamas (and many radicals insisted Israel was targeting civilians just cause). What people don't get is that urban warfare is the most difficult type of warfare. There are so many places to hide in cities in conjunction with the fact there are high density civilian populations in urban environments. This makes warfare extremely unsafe for all sides. Evacuating and bombing North Gaza was intended to flatten in to eliminate the hiding spots for Hamas so that urban warfare was safe for IDF soldiers. Unlike Hamas, Israel actually cares about the lives of its soldiers. The last thing Israel wants are more families losing their family members in this war, even though that is inevitable. In most wars, both sides want to save the lives of their citizens. This is why most countries don't have to worry about spending their own money and efforts saving the lives of the other side's civilians. Here, Hamas wants martyrs. It wants the death counts to increase because it makes Israel look horrible. That is their goal, and it is clearly working on the left and many liberal institutions. As a liberal, I am conflicted. I do not like war--I find it to be a bandaid to most problems--but I really believe getting rid of Hamas will help the Gazans in the long-run. Peace is not possible with Hamas in power. This conflict will only continue to make the Gazans suffer economically, politically, democratically, and health-wise if Hamas remains in power. I think the greater good is at stake here. Regardless of what you think of Israel's current leaders, the United States will not let Israel eat Gaza--nor does Israel want to. Israelis do not want to be outnumbered by Arabs for obvious reasons, so there's no chance they'll want to give the Palestinians in Gaza citizenship. If Hamas is eliminated, the P.A. or some moderate political group should undertake control of Gaza and hopefully neutralize tensions with Israel as time goes on. This is what I think must happen for peace to occur.

The proof is the peace agreements w Egypt and Jordan. 

My question is will these same groups agree to a 2SS if it meant (1) the end of the (military) occupation and (2) a fully autonomous and sovereign Palestinian state? What would it take? What do they want? My fear is the majority will not agree to a Jewish state in any capacity. 

Whether you believe the entire land does not belong to any Jews or should not include a Jewish state, that isn't going to happen and therefore it is a non-starter to peace. Therefore, in my view, the Palestinian cause has to accept a Jewish state will exist in some capacity. That is the starting point or we will have the same cycle again and again and again.

Israel releases footage of tunnels underneath Gaza’s largest hospital,"
&#x200B;

# Here are the facts:

&#x200B;

* **Israel’s IDF released footage on their** [X page](https://x.com/IDF/status/1726284807351472556?s=20) **of the tunnels which they say Hamas is using to carry out their militant operations**
* **Hamas and hospital staff has repeatedly denied that there is a command centre  below Shifa hospital.**

# What Israel is saying

**The IDF had released a similar video on Friday** ,however,  at the time only a gaping hole, which they said was the entrance to the extensive tunnels could be seen.

A [video released by the IDF](https://x.com/IDF/status/1726284807351472556?s=20) on Sunday from **inside the shaft** showed what we could not see from the top of the opening. The video shows a **spiral staircase leading down into a concrete tunnel**. The IDF said the tunnel shaft extends downwards approximately 10 meters and the tunnel runs for 55 meters.

A tunnel is ""not coherent with any form of normal hospital infrastructure"", **Sky News military analyst Sean Bell said**, adding that it appeared to be evidence that Hamas had been operating underground.

**“We need to demolish the underground facility that we found,”** said IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari to [the CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/middleeast/gaza-tunnel-shaft-al-shifa-hospital-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20need%20to%20demolish%20the%20underground%20facility%20that%20we%20found%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20IDF%20spokesperson%20Rear%20Admiral%20Daniel%20Hagari)

The footage released **does not confirm the existence of a hamas command centre**, however **it does show the tunnel networks that Israel had claimed existed.**

Israel is currently facing intense pressure from the international world to prove the existence of the Hamas command centre after the extensive bombing of Gaza’s largest hospital.

# What Palestine is saying

**Hamas and Hospital staff** [deny allegations](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-raids-gazas-al-shifa-hospital-2023-11-15/#:~:text=Al%20Shifa%20hospital%20had%20become,%22lies%20and%20cheap%20propaganda%22.) that the Hospital is being used as a Hamas Headquarters.

**Critics claim**  that these are tunnels built by Israel themselves during **the construction of Al-Shifa**

“Back in 1983, when Israel still ruled Gaza, they built a secure underground operating room and tunnel network beneath al-Shifa hospital – which is one among several reasons why **Israeli security sources are so sure that there is a main Hamas command bunker** in or around the large cement basement beneath the area of Building 2 of the hospital,” [*Tablet* added](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/top-secret-hamas-command-bunker-in-gaza-revealed#:~:text=The%20Israelis%20are%20so%20sure%20about%20the%20location%20of%20the%20Hamas%20bunker%2C%20however%2C%20not%20because%20they%20are%20trying%20to%20score%20propaganda%20points%2C%20or%20because%20it%20has%20been%20repeatedly%20mentioned%20in%20passing%20by%20Western%20reporters%E2%80%94but%20because%20they%20built%20it.).

The Al-Shifa hospital complex was **designed by Israeli architects**, initially built as part of a project commissioned by the department of public works, before it’s expansion and renovation in the 1980s, according to the Israeli news website [Ynet](https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b18e94cxp).

## Israel claims it destroyed underground infrastructure in 2021

**Israel bombed the area around al-Shifa during its assault on Gaza in May 2021** during the **al-Wehda airstrikes**.  The bombing reduced on of the busiest streets in Gaza, which is the main access point to al-Shifa hospital, into rubble.

Israel claimed that it was attacking **underground military infrastructure** located under the road, which they say **collapsed** caused unintended casualties among civilians.

However, I'm very concerned about the growing settler violence in the West Bank. I know 120 Palestinians have been killed by settlers and 1000 people have abandoned their villages as a result of settler violence. 

Have there been any arrests in the West Bank for the settler violence in the West Bank since Oct 7?

,"""I think if Hamas would target only military in 7th of october, I would have some much more sympathy towards Hamas and more understanding towards Palestine in general.""

I get what you mean, but I absolutely would not have more sympathy for Hamas, because:

- The 7th of October was a tsunami after a never ending storm of high and perilous waves. Palestinians have never stopped with jihadist terrorism towards Israeli civilians in 20 years of Hamas and in 75 years of Israel's existence. I wouldn't let them pass so easily because for once they actually targeted only equipped soldiers at work. Nothing erases the past, no matter how much the Al Jazeera and Far Left propaganda want to rewrite history to make Israel look like Germany in WWII.

- Hamas is a mini-dictatorship of islamists. They are fighting to create a little Iran.

- They want still to exterminate all jews, just reading their Charter gives you an idea.

- They want to cancel Israel from the map.",1,Wolven_Edvard,2023-11-20 19:52:45,k9zw0m9,,comment,t3_17zgqnm,israelpalestine

What I’ve gathered so far from Israel supporters..,"Hey, I’m new to the subreddit and don’t go on social media that much but I decided to see what Israel supporters think of what Israel is doing to Gaza.

-Hamas’ terrorism warrants carpet bombing of civilians and children.
-they know that Israel kills children and civilians, and it’s all Hamas’ fault because they initiated this on oct7, it’s like there’s a hidden law that says aggression against any state or entity is punishable by murdering your children and civilians. 
-I showed someone a 59min vid of dead children, all he could think of is if it wasn’t for Hamas attacking Israel, Israel wouldn’t have killed children, therefore it’s entirely Hamas’s fault.

I’m just having a hard time wrapping my head around their ideology and their way of thinking. If I try to defend the dead kids I’m a terrorist sympathizer.",57,MoodyCynosure,2023-11-20 20:49:04,17zl0qf,🏛️Politics,post,,AskMiddleEast

,"Most of my western friends are either neutral leaning towards palestine or pro-palestine, but i have met and talked with a few westerners that do support israel (non-jewish)

What i have managed to deduce so far:

1. They would call themselves allies of the 'west' as a political alliance
2. They believe israel is part of the 'west' political alliance and therefore they have a duty to protect israel
3. Some of them are straight up imperialists for this 'west' political alliance
4. They believe not supporting israel (or ukraine , for that matter) is equivalent to betraying the west, which ergo means betraying their own country and people
5. They are not full leftists, at best neo-liberal. Most of them other then the imperialist ones arent too right wing either. Most are around center.
6. Up until recently they all thought palestinians were basically terrorist apes
7. Most of their arguments boil down to 'but hamas' , they have a tendency to lowball every zionist crime and hyper fixate on all the bad things khamas has done
8. The only history of the region they know of is the zionist propaganda version, and not the palestinian one.
9. They tend to draw alot of parallels between 9/11 or islamic terror in europe to hamas.
10. Their knowledge of MENA politics dont go beyond 'they are bad/evil' and for the imperialists 'lets bomb them'
11. They get very annoyed that the established zeitgeist is going towards pro-palestine and they seemingly cannot tell why
12. They , almost unilaterally, dont even know that christian palestinians exist. If in the odd chance they know, they dont care.
13. Very politicized , usually a bit on the older side (late 20's mid 30's)",13,Turkbud,2023-11-21 03:45:19,ka198f3,,comment,t3_17zl0qf,AskMiddleEast

A senior spokesman for the group, Sami Abu Zuhri, gave an interview on Palestinian station al-Aqsa TV earlier this month.

He said: “This attests to the character of our noble, jihad-loving people – who defend their rights and their homes with their bare chests and their blood.
“The policy of people confronting the Israeli warplanes with their bare chests in order to protect their homes has proven effective against the occupation… we in Hamas call upon our people to adopt this policy in order to protect the Palestinian homes.”

Palestinian Authority foreign ministry deletes the false claim from social media that the Oct. 7 rave massacre was committed by the IDF,,25,TheLuvBub,2023-11-20 23:29:07,17znfzh,,post,,israelhamaswar
,"An article was published by Ynet which supports his claim.

 [https://archive.is/IIOLg](https://archive.is/IIOLg)  
The article translated by Google Translate, emphasis added:  
The  Air Force began summarizing the events of the surprise attack that  started the war in Gaza, and it appears that the fog of battle  accompanied not only the fighters on the ground, but also the air crews  that were launched into the skies of the Western Negev in the first  hours of Black Sabbath.The first pair of combat helicopters that were on  immediate alert for the Gaza Division arrived at Otef about an hour or  more after the events began, around 8:00-7:30, from the Ramat David camp  in the north. This is despite the fact that the mother squadrons of the  Apache helicopters are in Camp Ramon, which is closer to the Gaza  Strip. Bermon quickly realized that something unusual was developing and  brought up, with the commander of the 190 squadron Lt. Col. A himself, a  combat helicopter that arrived at Otef at 8:32.After the pilots  realized that there was tremendous difficulty in distinguishing within  the occupied outposts and settlements who was a terrorist and who was a  soldier or civilian, a decision was made that the first mission of the  combat helicopters and the armed Zik drones was to stop the flow of  terrorists and the murderous mob that poured into Israeli territory  through the gaps in the fence. 28 combat helicopters fired over the  course of a day The fighting all the ammunition in their stomachs, in  rearming rounds. These are hundreds of 30 mm cannon shells (the effect  of a spray grenade for each shell) as well as the Hellfire missiles. The  rate of fire against the thousands of terrorists was tremendous at  first, and only at a certain point did the pilots begin to slow down the  attacks and carefully select the targets.The Hamas army, it turns out,  deliberately made it difficult for the helicopter pilots and the  operators of the UAVs: in the investigation it became clear that the  invading forces were asked in the last briefings to walk slowly into the  settlements and outposts or within them, and under no circumstances to  run, in order to make the pilots think they were Israelis. This  deception worked for a considerable time , until the Apache pilots  realized that they had to skip all the restrictions. It was only around  9:00 a.m. that **some of them began to spray the terrorists with the cannons on their own, without authorization from superiors**.The  air activity on the first day was not organized, but even in the sky  the pilots improvised solutions to the complicated and unprecedented  situation: a large part of the fire direction and receiving the targets  from the forces fighting in the field reached the pilots through phone  calls or sending pictures on WhatsApp. Against the backdrop of the huge  number of murdered and kidnapped people, the Air Force is convinced that  if it weren't for the aid fire and the many attacks carried out by IDF  helicopter gunships that day - the carnage would have been much  greater.Another step that helped in the early hours for the air force  commanders to understand the seriousness of the incident occurred around  10:00 am, after the commander of the 190 squadron, Lt. Col. A, got off  his helicopter in Ramon to re-arm and refuel. He downloaded the full  photo film recorded by the helicopter's camera and quickly transmitted  it to the corps headquarters In Kriya. In less than 20 minutes he was in  the air again, and using the information he produced he instructed the  other air fighters to shoot at everything they see in the fence area,  and at one point he **also attacked an IDF post with besieged soldiers**  to help the fighters of the 13th Fleet attack it and free it .In one of  the cases, as part of the lifting of the restrictions he undertook, **he shot at a range of only 20 meters from the houses of one of the kibbutzim**  to cover the deputy commander of Division 80 who was jumped from the  Sinai sector and killed four terrorists in a fierce battle. According to  the Air Force, in the first four hours from the start of the fighting,  helicopters and fighter jets attacked about 300 targets, most of them in  Israeli territory.On the ninth day of the war (Sunday), the Air Force  is focused on an effort to eliminate senior Hamas officials at the same  time as preparing its massive part for a ground entry. Bahil **did  not address the possibility of the dilemma that would arise in  attacking targets where the top of Hamas are hiding - such as Muhammad  Daf or Yahya Sinwar - with Israeli hostages next to them as human  shields**.The Air Force is working to create a new buffer between  Israel and the Gaza Strip, up to three kilometers wide, and to  encourage the Gazans to move south in anticipation of the heavy damage  that will be inflicted on the city and the northern towns. The systemic  idea according to which the Air Force is now operating is ""the  destruction of the military, movement and governmental capabilities of  the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip that threaten Israel"". The  pilots were instructed to act calmly and professionally, with an  organized operational and intelligence logic behind each of the  thousands of attacks carried out so far.Now the air effort is invested  as mentioned in Gaza, but on high alert for the days of battle that are  already underway in the north. The IDF explains that the Air Force is  trained and equipped to deal with two arenas at the same time, but the  preference is to focus on one main arena. For example, the Air Force  does not automatically attack every Hezbollah anti-aircraft launcher  that fires a missile at Israeli drones.At the same time, the IDF has  long recognized a major effort by Iran to transport advanced weapons for  Hezbollah in Lebanon. According to foreign publications, it was the Air  Force that attacked the Syrian airports in Aleppo and Damascus in  recent days and disabled them, as well as large weapons convoys on their  way to Lebanon.The commander of the Air Force, Major General Tomer Bar,  commented on the events of the first day and said: ""There are many  heroic stories of fighters on the ground. The pilots killed many  terrorists and helicopters brought fighters to the battlefield while  facing fire at them. We are proud of them and the reservists who prove  the strength of the IDF and IDF The air. We investigate every day, and  improve every day.""Regarding a possible ground entry, he said: ""We are  preparing the arena for an effective maneuver as possible and removing  as many threats as possible from the ground and the air in order to give  the fighters operational freedom of action. We are currently focusing  on the southern arena but are highly prepared for any development that  may occur in the north as well.""",0,AssumedPersona,2023-11-21 04:33:36,ka1h006,,comment,t3_17znfzh,israelhamaswar

,"This isn't new information. Its precisely the reason why Israel is so sure why theres a Hamas base. They've been railing against this specific hospital for a decade now.

Israel renovated the Al Shifa hospital themselves back in the 80s-90s. The architect that has built multiple sections of the hospital has given multiple interviews with the media about it. Its why theyre so confidant about the Al Shifa hospital being a hamas base and having a network of tunnels connecting to a central bunker. Because they built the bunker in the first place as a basement level. Its why they sent in ground troops inside instead of just surrounding it like they did with Rantissi hospital or the Indonesian hospital.

Did the world forget so easily about the 7.10 massacre?,"A bit of backstory
For those who live under a rock and don't know what happened,on 7.10 Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel,in the aftermath 1,400 people were murdered,240 hostages in Gaza and 200,000 israelis were displaced from their home,
That was the event that kickstarted the war(for more details feel free to search up online)

In response Israel began a military campaign in Gaza with the goal to dismantle and eliminate Hamas entirely,a TERRORIST organisation known for using the civilian population as Human Shields and the civilian infastructure as ""humanitarian"" shields,fighting an enemy who uses such guerilla tactics(if you can call it like that) is very hard to do so without hurting the civilian population they're hiding behind.

It's not right to harm civilians even under such circumstances I know and believe me Israel is doing the maximum effort to minimise the civilian casualities but Israel can't guarantee their safety,Gaza's safety and security was entrusted in the hands of Hamas and they failed Gaza,Hamas did the exact opposite and cared only for their safety and now innoncent Gazans are suffering not because of Israel but because of Hamas.

The media presents only the poor Gazans but they neglected completely the precursor to their condition,the media didn't show their celebrations of the massacre on 7.10,they didn't show the dead bodies of Israeli men,women and children laying lifeless on the streets,they didn't show the horrible footage filmed by Hamas terrorists on 7.10

Why?

Maybe because it's not interesting to watch idk
And before you blame me for ignorance and ""whataboutism"",I know that some media outlets did cover the massacre but many big media outlets out there didn't,instead they were too busy with Gaza.

Just don't forget how Gaza got to its current state

,"I'm not Jewish, but I can't believe how Israel lets its opponents dominate the narrative. Israel really needs to hire some huge, international public relations firms. I think Israelis, and maybe Jewish people in general, drastically overestimate how familiar most citizens in Western countries are with their story, who the Jewish people are, the history of Israel, and what Jewish society and culture represents. I think this may have something to do with rapidly increasing secularism in the West. It will probably come as a shock to most Jews, but I honestly think a huge cohort of younger people in places like the US, Canada, the UK, continental Europe believe that the Jews are just white Europeans who woke up one day and decided to randomly move to the Middle East, in the mode of British colonists in Kenya or something. They know little or nothing of the Jews' historical ties to that region. They regard the Bible as fiction (at best). Israel should really be financing huge film and television projects, and top-flight documentaries with big international appeal--in English--that tell its story.

Can we dispatch with this genocide claim? Muslims in Palestine have quadrupled since 1945,"There is a bad habit in the pro-Palestinian side to redefine words, theories,ideas, crimes to make it fit this war or conflict and make Zionists look worst. One of which fixation with accusing Israel of Genocide. Look has Israel committed war crimes in the past? Yes. So did everyone in the 40s decade. 


But genocide? There is no genocide. During the 1931 census of Mandatory Palestine the British saw about 1.2 million residents of which .8 Million were Muslims by 1945/8 the estimate was a 1.8 million population with 1.2 being Muslims. Since the founding of Israel the theory goes Israel has carried ethnic cleansings and genocide against Palestinians. However any good google search reveals that claim as wrong. In Gaza there are 1.2 million to maybe 1.8 million Palestinians of Muslim faith  the West Bank has somewhere between 2 or more million Palestinians. All of this while living under war and occupation from people doing acts of genocide against them.


How can a population of maybe 1.2 million, more than Quadruple under a genocidal occupation over 7 decades? 


The Austrian Painter reject in 3 years killed 6 million Jews 


The Ottoman Turks are believed to have killed 1 million Armenians in a year 


And in Rwanda in maybe 12 weeks they killed .8 million victims

,"I’ve struggled with this claim being applied to the Israel/Palestine situation for years. In my mind, and I think in its broader usage, genocide involves the annihilation of a people. Genocides like the Holocaust, Darfur, or Rwanda come to mind involving the deaths of millions and significant portions of populations getting wiped out. This conflict does not fit that scale of violence at all.

The fact is though that the definition of genocide is not dependent on large amounts of a population being wiped out. It’s doesn’t matter if the Palestinian population has grown, that doesn’t counter the claim of genocide. The only thing that does matter is intent. The UNs definition was formulated from the Genocide Convention organized by Raphael Lemkin the person who coined the term. Their definition says that killing people with the intent to destroy a people, in whole or in part, is genocide. This can be along racial, religious, ethnic, or national lines.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention

This means that if Israel’s intent can be proven to be to destroy Palestinians this qualifies as genocide regardless of the body count.

However, this also means that the definition of genocide can be applied to a lot of circumstances people wouldn’t traditionally think of it applying to. Hamas goal was clearly stated to be the killing of Israelis meaning that the Gazan government has been perpetrating a genocide of Israelis for years in the form of rocket attacks, stabbings, shooting, and more recently October 7th. The purpose of 9/11 was to kill Americans, I.e. killing a group in part based on national identity so that too was a genocide. In fact it can be argued that most terrorism meets the definition of genocide. 

To me all this sounds silly because I have a preconceived notion of what genocide is and none of these seem appropriate to bear that label. But at the end of the day I can’t argue with definitions.

,">In the present moment, Israel is bombing Gaza. This is undisputed, yes? 

In present moment, Hamas and PIJ hold 240 kidnapees, children and babies included. You ""forgot"" to mention that. 

Also, Israel Bombing Hamas in Gaza, is more accurate, but Hamas is almost everywhere in Gaza, covering themselves with women and children. 

>In the present moment, human beings are dying in Gaza, yes? Some of you say deserved, some of you say not. Let's not get into that now. 

Hardly anyone saying the innocents deserve it. 
But of course Hamas, its infrastructure and terrorists have to be eliminated. 

Again, no mention of Hamas and PIJ holding children. 

>Does the choice to bomb people end terrorism? Historically, has that ever happened? What is the point of the bombs? How is bombing the answer? Bombing is by definition an indiscriminate choice of weapon? How can that ever be a solution?

Why isn't one of your questions ""why doesn't Hamas releases the hostages they hold?""  

There is no choice to bomb people.
Israel is using expansive precision bombs and targets Hamas targets only, that's a very discriminative weapon of choice. 
Also, Israel doesn't try to end terrorism, that's a goal no one can achieve (beside maybe, like the muslim world leaders or something..). Israel's goal is to eliminate Hamas, that's a very valid goal and a manageable one. 

Bombing is the answer when you fight a war with an organisation that swears to murder you, that use every aid given by EU, UN, Israel and more not to help it's own citizens, but to build terror tunnels, and prepare to launch massacres on innocent civilians in Israel ""until Israel is destroyed"".

>If Hamas is not defeated in Gaza, it will inspire many groups around the globe. They will see that few thousands of savages can blackmail the international community, the superpowers, and bring democracies to their knees. Many of them are watching now and many of them are very happy about how the world is responding and many of them are satisfied to see the state of confusion and fear and anxiety.

Not to mention the work visas extended to Palestinians so they can enter Israel and earn the current wage. 

While Palestine shares a border with Jordan they are not allowed work visas, receive no aid from them and are not allowed to become citizens of Jordan. The same goes for Egypt sharing a border yet refusing them entrance. Why?

,"I think you are conflating Israeli Arabs with West Bank Arabs and Gazan Arabs.  

That's important because the Israeli Arabs by and large have a very different perspective and relationship with the state of Israel and the Jews.  They enjoy wealth and civil freedoms beyond that of any other Arab populace in the Middle East.  While there are currents of unrest and the desire for an Arab-only state that exist within the populace, there are also a large percentage of Israeli Arabs that understand that if the Jews go, so does the democracy and 1st world economy.

The Gazans don't participate in Israel's economy, and live in an islamofascist enclave that deprives them of freedoms, civil rights or any hope at a future.  It is true that they voted for this future, 17 years ago.  But it is also clear that they blame Israel largely for the deprivations caused by their own leadership and voting choices.  If you took that 18 billion and put it over the last 17 years into infrastructure, education, health care, and energy, tech and tourism sectors, you'd have something really great; sort of like a Dubai or Singapore on the Eastern Mediterranean.  

The West Bank Arabs comprise a third differently situated group with their own perspectives.

However, I think it is fair to say that none of the three groups have significant anger towards other states for not taking them in as immigrants because all three groups want to live in Israel, by whatever name they call it.",1,Jack_stone_reddit,2023-11-22 12:00:50,ka8lw00,,comment,t3_180tveu,israelpalestine
,"Most of the Arab states, which are dictatorships/monarchies, aren't keen to bring in mass numbers of radicalized Palestinians. Jordan has a long and problematic history with its own Palestinian residents. Basically, the Palestinians are a pain and they have a history of destabilizing the countries that host them.

I believe the other Arab states pretend that accepting more Palestinians would ""validate"" Israel's actions. So Egypt claims they want to keep the Palestinians on their land and they don't want to contribute to the process of moving them off their land. But in reality, they're scared to death of Hamas, which is an Islamist group that would probably try to overthrow the Egyptian gov't if it got the chance (being itself an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood).",1,Mikec3756orwell,2023-11-22 13:02:50,ka8uhnj,,comment,t3_180tveu,israelpalestine
,">What reasons do you believe the Arab nations have for dismissing Palestine? And are you angered by this? 

Let's look at each of the Arab nations (at least those who have actively supported the Palestinian cause to destroy Israel in the past). 

**Jordan:** 

Jordan annxed the West Bank after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and gave all the Arabs living there are the time of annexation full Jordanian citizenship and rights. 

The Palestinians caused a lot of strife for the Jordanians from the get go. In 1951, one year after Jordan annxed West Bank, the Palestinians shot dead King Abdullah I while he was visiting Al-Asqa Mosque in East Jerusalem, creating a succession crisis in Jordan. 

They then started to cause a lot of strife for the Jordanian Government, by forming the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (or the fedayeen) starting protests and riots in order to agitate the Government to continue fighting and sending Jordanian soldiers to fight Israel (despite having lost several times in the past). The agitations got so bad that they started hijacking planes in Jordanian airports and blowing them up. Soon, Black September started and in 1971, the Palestinians managed to assassinate Wasfi Tal, the Prime Minister of Jordan, and even attempted a coup by attempting to divide the Jordanian military. So King Hussein bin talal  expelled the fedayeen who fled to Lebanon - we'll get to Lebanon in a second. 

By 1988, Jordan had had enough of the Palestinians and effectively revoked their annexation of the West Bank, revoked all the rights and priviledges of Jordanian citizenship that the Palestinians once had, and declared that they did not want to deal with Palestine any more, though they still wished to see an independent Palestinian state. 

So this is likely why Jordan does not want to provide santuary to Palestinians today. 

**Egypt**

Egypt likewise did the similar thing as Jordan with Gaza, turning Gaza in a puppet Egyptian state. 

During that time, Hamas formed as part of an offshoot fo the Muslim Brotherhood which was founded in Egypt. Egypt had multiple crackdowns of the Muslim Brotherhood and has supposedly succeeded in crushing them. Hamas however managed to survive and an offshoot of the Brotherhood and continues to survive and thrive in Gaza. Egypt does not want Hamas/Muslim Brotherhood back in its borders and since Palestine cannot guarantee that Palestinians crossing into Rafah arent Hamas, Egypt does not want to risk any Palestinians entering their borders.

This is likely why Egypt does not want to provide sanctuary to Palestinians today. 

**Lebanon**

During the post WWI period, Lebanon had been ruled by the French who eventually pulled out in 1946, forming the Republic of Lebanon a secular state but in which the Christians had slightly more representation in the Lebanese Parliament (55%) vs the Muslims who had 45%. 

Post 1946, the sectarian tensions within Lebanon was quite high and always remained high, but over the years, Lebanon managed to stabilise itself, predominantly by means of economic progress of the country. It was during the 1960s that Lebanon flourished, being named the Golden Age of Beirut and where the moniker of Beirut being the ""Paris of the East"" was first coined. 

However, remember how Jordan expelled the fedayeen who fled to Lebanon in the 1970s? Well the PLO started to agitate the Muslims there against the Government of Lebanon, fanning the idea of Lebanon being an Islamic State rather than a secular one. This agitation soon lead to violence and the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War which lasted 15.5 years finalling ending in 1990, after which Lebanon expelled the PLO from their borders. 

So this is likely why Lebanon does not want to provide sanctuary to Palestinians today. 

**Syria**

I havent done too much research on Palestinians and Syria but it's safe to say that Syria has its own problems with deal with in the current environment so taking in Palestinian refugees is understanbly very very low on its list of priorities at the moment, so this is likely why Syria does not want to provide sanctuary to Palestinians today",1,antsypantsy995,2023-11-22 14:25:35,ka95kq7,,comment,t3_180tveu,israelpalestine

Article: there is no moral equivalence between Hamas and the IDF,"As written in [this](https://martinkramer.org/2023/10/26/nazi_case_for_hamas/) article by Martin Kraemer. He compares the way people like to equate IDF to Hamas to the Nuremburg Trials. Have a read and let me know what you guys think.

>The Einsatzgruppen were the paramilitary death squads of Nazi Germany, which carried out mass murder by shooting in Nazi-occupied Europe. They destroyed well over a million Jews, and two million people all told. After the war, their surviving senior commanders were put on trial at Nuremberg, charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes.  
>  
>The chief defendant, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, had been commander of Einsatzgruppe D, which carried out mass murders in Moldova, southern Ukraine, and the Caucasus. An economist and father of five, he had supervised the killing of 90,000 Jews. Ohlendorf imagined that he had a moral conscience. The killers under his command, he told a U.S. Army prosecutor, were prohibited from using infants for target practice, or smashing their heads against trees.  
>  
>During trial testimony, the prosecutor pressed Ohlendorf: “You were going out to shoot down defenseless people. Now, didn’t the question of the morality of that enter your mind?” Ohlendorf referred to the Allied bombings of Germany as a context:  
>  
>“I am not in a position to isolate this occurrence from the occurrences of 1943, 1944, and 1945 where with my own hands I took children and women out of the burning asphalt myself, and with my own hands I took big blocks of stone from the stomachs of pregnant women; and with my own eyes I saw 60,000 people die within 24 hours.”  
>  
>A judge immediately pointed out that his own killing spree preceded those bombings. But this would become known as the “Dresden defense,” to which Ohlendorf resorted still another time, in this exchange:  
>  
>Ohlendorf: I have seen very many children killed in this war through air attacks, for the security of other nations, and orders were carried out to bomb, no matter whether many children were killed or not.  
>  
>Q: Now, I think we are getting somewhere, Mr. Ohlendorf. You saw German children killed by Allied bombers and that is what you are referring to?  
>  
>Ohlendorf: Yes, I have seen it.  
>  
>Q: Do you attempt to draw a moral comparison between the bomber who drops bombs hoping that it will not kill children and yourself who shot children deliberately? Is that a fair moral comparison ?  
>  
>Ohlendorf: I cannot imagine that those planes which systematically covered a city that was a fortified city, square meter for square meter, with incendiaries and explosive bombs and again with phosphorus bombs, and this done from block to block, and then as I have seen it in Dresden likewise the squares where the civilian population had fled to—that these men could possibly hope not to kill any civilian population, and no children.  
>  
>Ohlendorf thought this defense so powerful that he invoked it yet another time:  
>  
>The fact that individual men killed civilians face to face is looked upon as terrible and is pictured as specially gruesome because the order was clearly given to kill these people; but I cannot morally evaluate a deed any better, a deed which makes it possible, by pushing a button, to kill a much larger number of civilians, men, women, and children.  
>  
>(The chief prosecutor, an American, called this particular iteration “exactly what a fanatical pseudo-intellectual SS-man might well believe.”)  
>  
>At Nuremberg, this sort of tu quoque defense (“I shouldn’t be punished because they did it too”) wasn’t admissible. Still, in the verdict of the Einsatzgruppen Trial, the judges chose to refute it. “It was submitted,” the judges wrote, “that the defendants must be exonerated from the charge of killing civilian populations since every Allied nation brought about the death of noncombatants through the instrumentality of bombing.” The judges would have none of it:  
>  
>A city is bombed for tactical purposes… it inevitably happens that nonmilitary persons are killed. This is an incident, a grave incident to be sure, but an unavoidable corollary of battle action. The civilians are not individualized. The bomb falls, it is aimed at the railroad yards, houses along the tracks are hit and many of their occupants killed. But that is entirely different, both in fact and in law, from an armed force marching up to these same railroad tracks, entering those houses abutting thereon, dragging out the men, women and children and shooting them.  
>  
>The tribunal sentenced Ohlendorf to death. He was hanged in June 1951.

**\*\*Edit: adding one more part of the article since many people clearly aren’t bothered to read it.**

>**“Let’s be clear: this isn’t a world war. October 7 isn’t the Holocaust continued: in three months of 1942 alone, on average, the Nazis killed more than ten times the amount of Jews killed on October 7, every single day (Operation Reinhard). And Gaza is not Dresden, Hamburg, Pforzheim, Kassel, or any of the other German cities bombed so intensively that they literally burst into flames. The Israel-Hamas war is a skirmish by comparison.**  
>  
>**But the Ohlendorf and Hamas defenses are the same, and so is the identity of their victims.”\*\***

,"On July 19, 1948, Iraq amended penal code Law 51 against anarchy, immorality, and communism, adding the word “Zionism.” Zionism itself now became a crime, punishable by up to seven years in prison. As every Jew was thought to be a Zionist, every Jew was thereby criminalized. Only two Muslim witnesses were needed to denounce a Jew, with virtually no avenue of appeal.

In urban sweeps, thousands of Jewish homes were searched for secret caches of money thought destined for Israel. Frequently this necessitated demolishing walls as part of the search. One man was sentenced to five years’ hard labor for merely possessing a scrap of paper with an Old Testament Hebrew inscription; the paper was presumed to be a coded Zionist message. Hundreds of Jews were now arrested, forced to confess under torture, punished financially, and sentenced to long jail terms.

The greatest shock to the Jewish community occurred when the single wealthiest Jew in Iraq, Ford automobile importer Shafiq Ades, was accused of sending cars to Israel. Ades was tried by a military tribunal, quickly found guilty, fined $20 million and handed a death sentence. His entire estate was liquidated. A few days later, on September 23, 1948, Ades was publicly hanged in Basra. His body was allowed to languish in the square for hours, to be abused by the celebrating crowds.

Palestinians don’t mind foreign occupation; they just hate Jews.,"All this nonsense about “colonization” ignores Palestinian history.    


For centuries the Palestinians were occupied by Turkey with hardly a complaint against Turkish rule. Then in 1914 the Turks declared war on Britain and used Palestine as a springboard for attacking the Suez Canal.  The Brits counterattacked and conquered Palestine.  Then in 1937 the Palestinians revolted against British rule, mostly because they objected to Jewish immigration.    
  


In 1947 the Palestinians could have had a two state solution, but the Arabs chose war instead.  In the aftermath, the Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt and the West Bank by Jordan.  Again the Palestinians didn’t complain so long as their occupiers maintained hostility to the Jewish state.    


Occupation was never the issue.  Jewish rule is what the Palestinians object to.

,"I’m going to speak to what I know personally, from within my network. 

One of my best friends lost her de facto uncle. Not by blood, but he was family. Their families often celebrated together. He brought so much joy and lightness to everyone who knew him. On Oct 7, he was with his daughter and niece at the Nova festival. They escaped along with 40 other people into a bomb shelter. 

When Hamas came in shooting with rifles and RPGs, he guarded his loved ones with his body. He kept them safe. The 9 out of 40 who survived had to hide underneath bodies and play dead. Do their best not to scream in agonizing pain. This man died a hero. 

My mom’s very good friend in Israel’s daughter went missing on the 7th. By the 10th she was identified as dead. I don’t know her name, but I saw a picture. She had gorgeous blonde curly hair. She looked about my age. 

Oct 7 was one of my best friends since childhood’s bday — she lives in Israel. For her birthday, Hamas took three of her drinking buddies — two dead, one hostage (status unknown) the hostage is named Inbar. I pray for her and think of her every day. 
This friend’s little sister has been dating the same guy for a couple of years or so. They’re 20. On Oct 9, my friend texted me a screenshot of her conversation with him. He said, “more than half of my friends are dead or missing.”

My cousin found out her friend was dead when a photo of his mutilated body was shared. 

Nothing is ever going to be the same. We’re all sick with grief. I know the Palestinian people are suffering so much loss, pain, grief, fear, and instability as far as basic survival needs.

Change my mind: Being sad about Gaza is kind of like being sad that Dresden got bombed during WWII.,"In order to defeat the Nazis, Allied powers bombed Dresden in 1945. It is a beautiful historic city that was almost all civilians but few deny that the alternative (allowing Nazism to spread through Europe) was the right strategy. Allied forces had la common enemy and common values (in the modern context, the common value is not allowing a terrorist organization to kill more Israelis) they were willing to go to war for.

No one is saying that all Palestinians are Hamas but people who call for their “freedom” essentially call for the terrorist group they are currently represented by and that rules the area to continue to do atrocities. How is that different from leaving “innocent Germans” (of which there were many under Hitler) to live in peace? Such reasoning can be had only by those who do not see Hamas as a terrorist group and support their ideology. Which, because of their antisemitism, many do!

As an aside, those who cannot fight for the most basic of values like democracy is good and kidnapping babies is bad because they fear international outrage or hurting innocents will eventually be conquered by those who, like Hamas, have no such qualms. Their charter makes what they want to achieve clear as day and some of you are still saying “isn’t it racist to call them aggressive” and “but maybe we can all just get along.” Such attitudes can only be had by extremely privileged people whose safety was never in question.",56,FantasticSchedule29,2023-11-22 11:37:59,180wc7t,,post,,israelpalestine

,"Well, I am Palestinian, and honestly, I see your reasoning, and I see how it can make sense.

But, first of all, Dresden bombing is observed by many from all parties as a war crime, and it is one of the basis of the forth Geneva convention.

>people who call for their “freedom” essentially call for the terrorist group they are currently represented by and that rules the area to continue to do atrocities.

No, calling for freedom is not calling for continuing to do atrocities. Gaza in 2018-2019 had peaceful marches after the provocation from Trump when he moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In these marches included no attacks from Hamas or any party,  223  were killed from Gaza, and over 9k were wounded. In 2010, Turkey organized with other nations, shipments by sea to deliver some necessities to people of Gaza, these include medical supplements, generators, food, toys, material for buildings and so on. Israelis raided and attacked these ships, were 10 activists from around the world were killed on these ships. Their problem was the cement was in the shipments and Israel blockade includes the blockade of cement.

In 2014, Israel targeted Gaza's ONLY power plant, causing a huge electricity shortage till this day. I literally can go on forever. Israel does not allow to many of the people in Gaza to complete their education outside of Gaza, just because why not. Between 2007-2010, Israel had a human minimum calories calculator so they can enter the minimum amount of food. Most people in Gaza when they want medical need from Egypt, are not allowed to get outside of Gaza, until they give up some information about some Hamas members, and hence more than 2/3 dont get the medical attention they need, I literally can go on forever, all what I have mentioned is documented by 3 parties and was making sure that I dont include any Hamas based resources. But my point is, people of Gaza do not have a normal life by an means, power outages are daily, their water is 88 Liters which is below the 100 recommended by the UN, cant go outside, need a permission to basically do most things, I honestly know some people from Gaza who immigrated outside of Gaza for work, and they dont visit their families back, because there is a very high possibility that they wont be granted to get back outside of Gaza, not really to mention that this is the 5th war, and almost everyone there knows or is related to someone who was killed by an Israeli raid.Freedom does not mean atrocities, they have a very very below basic life, and they have tried to protest, they have tried to break the blockade by ships, all did not work, and that why for them Hamas are freedom fighters.

,"To justify your acts in contemporary society with a comparison using the standards of morality/conflict from over 80 years ago is one of the MOST FALLACIOUS arguments I have ever seen.

There is a reason the 4th Geneva was signed AFTER WW2. Standards of war, as well as what constitutes a war crime have changed over the last 80 years (and 10,000 years) because we as a society have realized that as horrendous as war inherently is, there are certain things which we must prevent from occurring again.

According to CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL LAW, the bombing of Dresden, the Blitz and the atomic bombing of Japan were ALL WAR CRIMES.

During the time period in which those battles occurred, they were NOT WAR CRIMES because, during those times, many of the 4th Geneva laws did not exist for us to judge people by them. However, recognizing the damage we all had done, justified or not, we made agreements to prevent such widespread horrors from occurring again, even in times of war.

While the 4th Geneva Laws did not exist during WW2, today they do, and we must abide by and judge by them.

These are the same laws that call Hamas terrorists/war criminals. These are the same laws that permit Israel to fight Hamas in self-defence with a ""proportional"" response. These are the same laws that say the West Bank occupation/settlement is colonialism and both a human rights violation and war crime that can be resisted with force.",1,CulturalCranberry960,2023-11-22 17:17:20,ka9ocx6,,comment,t3_180wc7t,israelpalestine

Who is not a zionist?,"Background: I am a mid 30’s male physician living in the US. I was raised with a strong Jewish identity but no religion. I absolutely disagree with the expansion of settlements in the West Bank. I hate that Israel is becoming more fundamentalist because Haredi Jews have 2-3x more babies than secular Jews. I think Benjamin Netanyahu should be fired and arraigned for his failure to protect the state of Israel on October 7th, his support for expansion of settlers in the West Bank, and a litany of other aggressions. I have ongoing struggles with how Israel has responded to the Hamas attack, but I generally think it has been heavy-handed and would prefer to see more grace.

I also think that Israel should be allowed to exist as a homeland for the Jewish people. This makes me a zionist. I can understand why people from the Palestinian diaspora and MENA don’t agree that Israel should exist as a homeland for the Jews. My questions for everyone else are:

(1) If you believe that Israel should exist as a homeland for the Jewish people, do you consider yourself a zionist?

(2) If you don’t believe that Israel should exist as a homeland for the Jewish people, where do you think Jewish-Israelis should go?",29,DrLegVeins,2023-11-22 13:11:30,180y81c,,post,,israelpalestine

The Jews are also indigenous to the land people living there continuously for over 1000 years.

So I believe the term 'Zionism' today is a nonsensical term today.  It's like saying Mexico has no right to self govern, let's end it.

,"I'm not Jewish, but I can't help noticing that you just wrote an entire post in which you seem to blame Jews for the situation the state of Israel currently finds itself in. I've noticed that it's kind of a Jewish trait to think, when disaster happens, ""we could have done something different."" Sometimes that's true, but more often it's not. What makes you think, for example, that if there were no settlers on the West Bank, or if all of Israel were completely secular, it would make any difference? It's taken as gospel that the situation would be better, but I don't see why. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005-2006, and things didn't just fail to improve, they got significantly worse. If all the settlers left the West Bank, why wouldn't it just become a new front for rocket attacks and border incursions?

When, as as non-Jewish person, I look at this situation from 30,000 feet, the core issue (to me) is that the Palestinians cannot reconcile themselves to living beside millions of Jews and giving up the right of return. They can't tolerate it. Living the way they do currently is more palatable to them than compromise. Israel can't really influence that basic sentiment--at all.

How is Israel so bad at propaganda?,"When this all started I was already anti-Israel, but I did think the attack by Hamas was horrific. And I largely saw the same sentiment from others. My very leftist friend even started out way more understanding of Israel than he's ever been.

Over a month later, things couldn't be more different. I'm still adamant that Hamas is bad, and I believe that most people agree, but I'm seeing more and more people entertaining the idea that they're the lesser evil. I think this is partially because Israel's propaganda is terrible.

Even ignoring the explicitly genocidal rhetoric, they're busy posting cartoons about c*m retrieval and laughable videos pointing at calendars and toilets as damning proof. I keep seeing Hamas videos of them walking up to tanks and embarrassing IDF soldiers in combat, meanwhile the IDF is posting tik toks mocking dead children and having raves untop of rubble. There's a recent video of a Hamas guy talking about wanting to go explore nature after the war, and despite knowing consciously that he might be a cold blooded murderer, he comes off more likeable than any IDF soldier I have ever seen, especially the pathetic IDF supermodels they keep trying to push. I mean since when are you even allowed to bring DJ kits to war? Is this all a holiday for the IDF?

,"What a nuanced and balanced take. 

Indeed, it is objectively true that Israel’s propaganda is no match for the onslaught of propaganda from the entire Muslim world combined with the anti west agitators in Russia and China. The very idea of a war being live-streamed to uninformed individuals on the internet is, in my opinion, ridiculous no matter which side is publishing the footage. However, if you eagerly and uncritically accept Palestinan sympathizing propaganda such as “Hamas embarrassing the IDF in combat” while automatically rejecting and ridiculing any claims made by Israel and its sympathizers, you might want to check your bias. 

Both sides are engaging in heavy propaganda and all of it should be evaluated with a healthy level of critical thinking. However, the idea that Palestine’s propaganda is magically more trustworthy than Israel’s is an absolute absurdity. Let’s remember that it wasn’t that long ago that Palestinian propaganda wings completely invented a story of a hospital being hit with a bomb that “killed 500 people with hundreds buried under rubble” only for the story to have been shown to have been a complete fabrication within a few short hours. Note, this has nothing to do with Israel’s propaganda regarding who was responsible for firing the missile but rather, the clear fact to any objective observer that the entire incident didn’t happen at all.

It seems like the reason you think Israel is bad is because soldiers aren't depressed all the time and because of idiotic comments, while ignoring the idiotic comments on your side.

Mixed feelings about hostage release,"While im happy for the hostages and their families for their release, it doesn’t feel right to cease fire even for a temporary period of time.. it will only give hammas time to regroup and set booby traps..
even if all the hostages are released, it doesn’t change the fact that 1200 people lost their life on oct 7th.. hammas should still get eliminated.. i hope whatever is in the upcoming deal doesn’t lead to a permanent ceasefire.. not before eliminating each and everyone attacked Israel on oct 7th..",21,praveen956,2023-11-22 09:41:46,180trvf,Opinion,post,,israelpalestine

,"I am also struggling to understand my feelings on this matter. That being said, the elimination of Hamas both in its military capabilities and its top leadership is inevitable - Israel has no choice. I suspect the same will be true for Hezbollah once Gaza is done with. In fact, I don’t think the world has yet to see the full wrath of what Israel will unleash … at a time of her choosing. 

Regardless of the current political climate in Israel at the moment, you can’t ignore a deal that will get children and women back. You just can’t. Israel needs some morale boosters and they need to deliver children back to their families if the opportunity arises. 

Don’t think for a second that Israeli drones won’t be higher in the sky watching the strip - I would hope that if both the Mossad and Shin Bet approved this deal, there’s a good reason.  Moreover, the sooner Israel can make smaller deals to get more of its citizens home, the sooner Israel can act within the strip using more power and force without the weight of the hostages on their mind.

Trust me, Hamas will be eliminated through and through in due course. The IDF took control of Northern Gaza in two weeks, it’s been an astonishing military accomplishment and it’s only the beginning.",1,Formal_Math6891,2023-11-22 09:48:08,ka830pr,,comment,t3_180trvf,israelpalestine

"More Poll Discussion: ""From the River to the Sea"" Meaning","[I wrote about this in my previous post](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17xfnk0/palestinian_poll_on_the_107_attacks_show/), but I think it was lost among the main topic of discussion and it's worthy of its own discussion. Mods, feel free to remove if you disagree.

The Arab World for Research and Development is a polling institute out of Birzeit University, a Palestinian university located in the West Bank. It released a poll recently. [This poll](https://www.awrad.org/en/article/10719/Wartime-Poll-Results-of-an-Opinion-Poll-Among-Palestinians-in-the-West-Bank-and-Gaza-Strip) was conducted by Palestinians.

Here's the question and findings we're discussing today: **Do you support the solution of establishing one state or two states in the following formats?**

One-State Solution for Two Peoples: West Bank - 7.7%, Gaza - 2.2%, Total - 5.4%   

Two-State Solution for Two Peoples: West Bank - 13.3%, Gaza - 22.7%, Total - 17.4%

**A Palestinian state from the river to the sea: West Bank - 77.7%, Gaza - 70.4%, Total - 74.7%**

 A supermajority of Palestinians want a ""solution"" of a Palestinian state from the (Jordan) river to the (Mediterranean) sea. That means no more Israel and all of Palestine.

Something to take away from this poll is that clearly, in my view anyway, the phrase ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" for the Palestinians themselves, means ""destroy Israel."" It's always meant that and it always will. 

In my opinion, it does not matter if you as a theoretical Westerner at a university rally chanting that phrase intends it to mean that all Palestinians from the river to the sea will be free and happy to pursue their interests and peace reigns forever and ever. If you chant this phrase, Palestinians will take that to mean you support their cause of a Palestinian state from the river to the sea.  

Unless you go around chanting ""From the river / to the sea / Palestine will be free / by which I mean / Palestinians won't be occupied / and there will be peace / between Israel / and the Palestinians, "" the phrase means what it means to Palestinians and they'll interpret your chanting of it as agreement of their goal. 

In my view, the phrase is anti-Israel and anti-peace, and this poll proves it. What do you think?",21,TracingBullets,2023-11-22 05:21:08,180nklw,,post,,israelpalestine

You can kill an idea.,"Isis was defeated by a combined group of Arabs and the USA.

The Vietcong was crushed by bombing them, and then North Vietnam had to march in a conventional army two years later. 

Chushi Gangdruk in Tibet was crushed when the CIA stopped funding it and China kept killing it. 

The Forest Brothers in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were crushed by overwhelming soviet power. 

The Cursed soldiers in Poland were shot or sent to prison camps. 

The Ukrainian Insurgent Army in Ukraine was crushed with a mixture of violence and assassination. 

In Iraq the insurgency was mostly suppressed till the Arab spring.

Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, militarily defeated.

Sendero Luminoso and FARC (communist guerrillas) in South America.

In WW2 the Nazis were defanged and purged in Germany after they lost.

Lots of ideas have been murdered. Ideas require charismatic people, equipment, a willingness to fight back. There are a limited number of people willing to engage in guerilla warfare, which leaves you very vulnerable to being shot. Murder is a very effective tool to stop them. Notably, Hamas needs expertise in weapons forging, charismatic leaders, propaganda makers, skilled soldiers, equipment from Iran and North Korea, lots of special ingredients.

So, no matter how angry the Palestinians are, they won't have a meaningful ability to resist Israel once Hamas is crushed. There is no wait several hundred years just like they did for the crusaders as some Arabs imagine, Israel's technology lead grows greater each year and it gets better and better at fighting. Egypt and Israel are cooperating in preventing the movement of weapons into Gaza now, so they can't smuggle in more. Once they crush Hamas, this can be over. No doubt angry westerners and Arab nations will continue to hope for Palestinian freedom forever more, but the fate of Palestinians will be in the hands of Israel.

In addition, education programs like in Germany after WW2 could be pushed to de-radicalize the population. Most of Gaza is young, so they have impressionable young minds that can be shaped by Israel, rather than UN made propaganda about how killing Jews is good. 

This would benefit Israel and Palestine, enabling both to live in peace with the idea of Hamas dead, and the remaining resistance not cohesive enough to do stuff like launch 9/11 style attacks on Israel.",19,Nepene,2023-11-22 04:22:06,180m7xd,Opinion,post,,israelpalestine
,"You may be able to kill some ideologies, but you can't kill people's desire for equality and freedom, at least not without committing genocide. Bombs can never make people like you.

One of the best ways to kill an idea is showing a competing idea is better. If you manage to root out Hamas now, that victory will only be temporary if you don't make life better for Palestinians under a more reasonable government. It's easy to pacify a population living in relative luxury, and next to impossible to pacify a population of starving people. 

People who don't have hope, only hate from generations of oppression will have nothing to live for other than finding new and innovative ways to kill you. Palestinian resistance has only become more violent and desperate as time has gone on. 

If Israel crushes Hamas, then makes Gaza a relative paradise under a secular government, they may be able to kill the idea of Hamas, but if Gaza stays in ruins and people are oppressed and starving you won't have peace until you kill them all.",1,SomeoneSomewhere1984,2023-11-22 05:51:13,ka70686,,comment,t3_180m7xd,israelpalestine

You're conflating killing an idea with killing the manifestation of an idea. States deal with manifestations all the time, its standard policing but there is a big difference between killing an idea with killing the manifestation of an idea. If we take the Baltics for example; as soon as the USSR was unable/unwilling to perform the requisite policing to contain the independence movement it flourished as it had never been truly killed.

>In addition, education programs like in Germany after WW2 could be pushed to de-radicalize the population.

Denazification was not as effective as people believe it was. The reality of Germany and Japan is that most radicals got off scot free, the leadership was discredited after the war and there was no external bastion where they could flee to in exile.

Then there is all these Pro-Palestinian rallies mixed in with Pro-Hamas supporters or Hamas sympathizers (people who refuses to condemn Hamas terror acts or believes Hamas is represents the Palestinian people), Left wing, probably born and raised in America/ the West, not even Palestinian, never been to Palestine, does not speak Arabic, doesnt understand the conflict … and now comes along a Palestinian born son of a Hamas co-founder denouncing Hamas… look at the optics.

,"- my point is is that celebrities always had it easy, russia bad, Ukraine good, police man who killed George Floyd bad, BLM good, Iran bad, Iran women freedom good, abortion bad, pro choice good etc. It shows the hypocrisy. As long as Israel isn’t targeted it’s all good. They are all following an agenda and each day its becoming more clear and clear. The Israeli lobby needs to be demolished, they are everywhere!
What Kanye said is certainly not Anti-Semitic.

has been dropped from the movie scream V|| after being vocal about Palestine. She said that she can’t watch people being treated like that especially being Mexican herself and coming from a country that has been colonized.

,">How deeply Jewish is Hollywood? When the studio chiefs took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times a few weeks ago to demand that the Screen Actors Guild settle its contract, the open letter was signed by: News Corp. President Peter Chernin (Jewish), Paramount Pictures Chairman Brad Grey (Jewish), Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger (Jewish), Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton (surprise, Dutch Jew), Warner Bros. Chairman Barry Meyer (Jewish), CBS Corp. Chief Executive Leslie Moonves (so Jewish his great uncle was the first prime minister of Israel), MGM Chairman Harry Sloan (Jewish) and NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker (mega-Jewish). If either of the Weinstein brothers had signed, this group would have not only the power to shut down all film production but to form a minyan with enough Fiji water on hand to fill a mikvah.

"Israeli government approves hostage deal, pause in fighting with Hamas in Gaza - 50 Israeli women & children will be released, while Israel is to release ~150 Palestinian prisoners, mostly women & minors over the 4-day pause. Israel will allow around 300 aid trucks per day to enter Gaza from Egypt","The Israeli Cabinet on Tuesday approved a Qatar-mediated deal in which Hamas will free dozens of Israeli hostages in exchange for a four-day pause in fighting in Gaza and the release of dozens of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

In the first phase of the two-phase deal, Hamas is expected to free about 50 Israeli women and children held in Gaza, while Israel is expected to release about 150 Palestinian prisoners, mostly women and minors over the four-day pause.

As part of the deal approved by the cabinet, Israel will allow around 300 aid trucks per day to enter Gaza from Egypt. More fuel will also be allowed in during the pause in fighting, according to an Israeli official.
In a second phase, Hamas could release dozens more women, children and elderly people in return for Israel extending the ceasefire by several more days.

Over the next 24 hours, the names of the Palestinian prisoners set to be released will be made public so that Israeli citizens can appeal to court against their release, according to an Israeli official who briefed reporters earlier Tuesday.

Israel will not release Palestinian prisoners who have been convicted of killing Israelis, the official said.",58,TXDobber,2023-11-22 12:11:22,180x0vm,🏛️Politics,post,,AskMiddleEast

I imagine how the IDF captures all the terrorists and residents of Gaza who participated in the massacre, gathers them in one place and broadcasts live, so that the entire people of Israel can see, takes them one by one and anoints them well in pork fat and begins the torture.

After stripping the scum of its skin, they cut off his penis and let him see how his eggs are fried in canola oil and let him eat them, and this is how he is sliced into pieces slowly and patiently (we have a lot of time).

Hamas tunnel under Gaza hospital exposed after Israeli army busts open blast door,,44,TheMessengerNews,2023-11-22 06:25:08,180p2qa,,post,,israelhamaswar
,"The Israeli military released new imagery of the extensive tunnel networks used by Hamas underneath Gaza on Tuesday, after troops busted open a blast door to reveal how the subterranean passageways link to the besieged strip's largest hospital.

The images build on videos and other evidence made public in recent days by the Israel Defense Forces, which [have long held that Hamas has been using Shifa Hospital as a stronghold](https://themessenger.com/news/hamas-hiding-headquarters-alsharifa-hospital-gaza-israel-bombing) thanks to tunnels that run below the complex.

""Just through this door, underneath the Shifa Hospital, are Hamas’ terrorists tunnels,"" [the IDF wrote in a post on X Tuesday afternoon](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1727036384148348937). ""Here’s the PROOF of Hamas’ terrorism festering underneath hospitals.""

The pictures show what appears to be a heavy, bolted door swung open, revealing a hallway that extends into darkness, as well as another dark, narrow hallway formed by decrepit cement walls and overhead wires.

What no one has wanted to tell you in History classes.,"1. What no one has wanted to tell you in History classes is that the most aggressive imperialist project in the world since 1979 is that of the Iranian ayatollahs. They are the ones who have dedicated themselves to setting the world on fire.
They are the ones who have to be overthrown.
And that's Foucault's fault.

2. It sounds strange, but the French philosopher with the face of Uncle Lucas - father of the postmodern chicks - came to believe that the Iranian revolution led by Ayatollah Ali Khomeini was going to become the model of anti-empire and anti-system resistance, for everyone.

3. It is true that he tried to maintain a critical stance against the Iranian revolution in real time, but it did not help him. He refused to admit that the ayatollahs wanted to impose a theocracy.
Foucault had time to realize his monumental idiocy, but the damage was done.

4. Many of his followers - the vast majority, without Foucault's intellectual level, and without really critical skills - were left with the idea that any savage barbarity (note the elegant redundancy) was valid as ""resistance"" against ""the empire”.

5. This, at a time when Latin American guerrillas - for example - were already entering their phases of collapse and failure.
Postmodernism gave new ideological impetus to the idea of ​​violent resistance against anything that smacked of European whiteness.

6. The consequences are a stunning and scandalous intellectual debacle on the left. The ease with which they justify a feudal, religious fundamentalist, misogynistic and exploitative regime - because that is what the ayatollahs are - should be a scandal.

7. The Iranian regime is the antithesis of EVERYTHING that the left is supposed to have defended since the time of the French Revolution. But the global left clings to it because it is one of their last pretexts to feel that they continue fighting capitalism.

8. I mean, so you understand me, it's an ideology of resentful slimy people. Unfortunately, it is a pernicious ideology that has set the world on fire.
The obligatory question is do they have a chance of success?
And the answer is a resounding NO.

9. The ideas of this anti-Western and anti-Semitic resentment are based on a primitive and stupid vision of the world and reality. They are inefficient by definition. That is their great advantage: they represent a paradigm that is going to collapse on its own.

10. Liberal capitalism, on the other hand, has had the surprising quality of learning to correct itself, and that has led it to perfect its sense of efficiency. Therefore, against all odds, success is guaranteed in the long run.

11. ""But the ayatollahs can also be very efficient in their project,"" some have told me.
No, and the Iranian economy proves it.
The efficiency I speak of cannot be limited to one area (imperial expansion, for example). It has to be comprehensive.

12. All the great empires in history had their moment of maximum conquering efficiency. But they all fell, one after another. Because? Because none of them managed to build a market that would give them economic consistency.
And why they couldn't?

13. For two reasons. One, that industrial production had not been invented. Artisan production or the agricultural economy do not give you the elements to build a market that can finance, on its own, an empire.

14. And two, that the market only works correctly in conditions of absolute freedom. And an empire is, by definition, the complete opposite. The market needs free competition; the very essence of empires is the complete opposite.

15. The only economic model that allows the development of markets capable of providing economic support to large social structures is liberal and capitalist democracy.
That is why Iran is not in a position to confront the West.
And we are seeing it in Israel.

16. Much was said all the time that Hamas was taking advantage of every second of the truces to arm itself again to the teeth, and to improve its military possibilities.
Yes, but Israel too. And not only that. Israel has also perfected its technology.

17. Now that they are facing each other, Israeli superiority is evident. Where does it come from? That Israel is part of an entire international support network supported by the success of the free market. That is why Israel has more resources than Iran to confront this.

18. Putting the ayatollahs in order is going to be a headache, and international terrorism is very likely going to go through a new stage of boom.
But, in the long run, it is not a project with a future. It is going to collapse on its own, or with American and Israeli help.

19. The free world, meanwhile, just has to take care of not paying attention to the slimy wokes who don't even know what identity they have.",35,Ok-Pack-8866,2023-11-21 22:36:57,180eznh,,post,,israelhamaswar

,"I can appreciate this post even though there are far more conclusions than premises. Much of it is overly reductive and itself adhering to some pretty dated notions about economics. The Chicago School of thought is responsible for much more than the heaven of free markets you described. Real threats to humanity beyond our own warring tribes like pollution, resource consumption in pursuit of cheaper meaningless widgets (see crypto mining), etc need a spot on your list. You've presented things in absolutes as black and white and as a rule nothing is truly only 1 thing.

I would stipulate you take an even broader view and include Russia and China since while a theocratic regime may implode, it is not actually without friends. Great empires of the past didn't need modern industry because the historic industry was war itself for almost all of them. Being able to defeat other nations through war was the driving force, not economics. You didn't need to make if you can just take. And if your domestic problems ever became too much of a problem, you simply start up the war machine and they'll go away. Only a select few empires faded away because most of them died at the end of a blade or bullet. The movements of the present non-Western global 'empire builders' are certainly not happening in vacuum. Are they all acting like mini-Foucault's? 

For most of us in the West, the Holy Wars are over. But that doesn't mean you don't have enemies. Israel is not fighting a holy war and it is because of this that they have the support of the Western apparatus. The greatest export the West has is tolerance and we make it in abundance. That's the secret of capitalism - the more tolerant you are the greater your appeal. The greater your appeal the more massive your intellectual and developmental largess can become if for nothing else than the ability to outnumber the small minded, intolerant groups that kill in order to gain acceptance.",3,seldom_r,2023-11-22 04:47:29,ka6piz6,,comment,t3_180eznh,israelhamaswar

Hamas is garbage.,"UPDATE: ADDITIONAL HOSTAGE DEAL DETAILS

- 50 women and children to be released from Gaza

- 4-5 day pause in fighting

- 3 Palestinian prisoners released for every Israeli hostage

- RED CROSS to be GRANTED ACCESS to hostages still in Gaza

- Before the deal can be completed, Israeli Law requires that the names of the Palestinian prisoners to be published, so members of the public can appeal and petition the release on specific grounds.

- Netanyahu Statement: 

""We are at war, and will continue the war until we achieve our goals""  

- Some members of the Israeli public have expressed concern that the pause will lead to international and importantly, American pressure to extend the ceasefire permanently.  This is highly unlikely to happen as Hamas still would pose a risk for Israel and would be viewed as a win for Hamas and a loss for Israel. 

- The Red Cross provision is a massive positive development for the wellbeing of the hostages and may be a PR win for Hamas as they try to rebrand themselves from a terror group to a legitimate resistance group following the laws of war and armed conflict in the eyes of the international community.",31,rivierasamaxe,2023-11-22 10:25:16,180urpx,,post,,israelhamaswar

"Why did my friend say “that’s funny, because Palestine isn’t a thing..”?","
All I said was “a customer came into my work today and I asked where he was from and he said Palestine.” She snapped  “that’s funny, because Palestine isn’t a thing”. 

Idk, I wasn’t trying to trigger or spark any kind of inflammatory response. I was just stating what happened at work. 

I didn’t know she was Zionist before this but regardless if she is or not, I feel like you could’ve just said “oh what else did he say” or “how long has he been here” “is his family here too” etc.. 

It’s just weird to me someone can believe that a Palestinian doesn’t exist. Just completely deny someone’s existence or identity. I also don’t think there’s anything “funny” about any of this.

,"For reference, a lot of Jews are feeling a bit beleaguered right now -- this conversation you had with your friend is probably the hundredth she's had in the last few weeks where someone ""just happened"" to bring up Israel / Palestine (I know you *literally* just happened to, but nevertheless).

Every Jew I know has had people bring up this conflict *simply because we're Jewish,* and most of these folks have had no issue with immediately calling us names or attacking us if we don't pass their litmus test for being a ""good Jew"". So give her the benefit of the doubt here.

>I didn’t know she was Zionist before this but regardless if she is or not, I feel like you could’ve just said “oh what else did he say” or “how long has he been here” “is his family here too” etc..

Yes, she could certainly have done that -- and probably should have. As you've surmised, being a Zionist does not mean you don't believe Palestine exists / should exist ... all it means is believing Israel should continue to exist, which is an overwhelmingly common opinion among Jews (and everyone outside of the Arab world, tbh).

>It’s just weird to me someone can believe that a Palestinian doesn’t exist.

That's probably not what she meant ... what she (probably) meant was that there is no such state as Palestine (technically true, but misleading; Palestine is an observer in the UN, has a government that Israel recognizes as legitimate, issues ID cards, etc.) or that the Palestinian national identity is fake or invented (not really true; emerging in the 20th century doesn't make it any less legitimate than say, the Jordanian national identity).

I imagine a lot of folks will tell you what is ""technically"" true and what isn't; unfortunately a lot of these commenters are themselves not very well informed. I'd recommend reading a couple of posts if you have the time:

* In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/q8w3hd/palestine_propaganda_and_the_misuse_of_history/), I provide an overview of Palestine and of Palestinian identity; the long and the short of it is that people have described themselves as ""Palestinian"" for a *very* long time -- but they've meant ""from the region of Palestine"", not an ethnic or national group ... similar to how someone describing themselves as a ""Californian""; it's not an ethnic group, it's a place you come from.
* A lot of folks on the Zionist side are very attached to the idea that Jews are indigenous to the region (which is true) and that Palestinian Arabs are not (which is not true). In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/z776on/palestine_propaganda_and_the_misuse_of_history/) I rebut that argument extensively. A group of people not thinking of themselves in terms of ethnic nation-states isn't relevant to whether they're indigenous to they place they, and their ancestors, were born.
* Syrian nationalism and Pan-Arab nationalism predate Palestinian Arab nationalism; as pan-Arab nationalism receded in the 1970s, the concept of Palestinian Arab nationalism gained a lot of ground, and became the common identity by the late 1980s; that led to Jordan and Egypt withdrawing their territorial claims to Gaza and the West Bank in favor of the PLO.
* A two state solution coincides with that idea; two nations, two states. You only need to deny one or the other group's indigenousness if you think it justifies denying them self-determination.",1,badass_panda,2023-11-23 01:38:33,kaayorx,,comment,t3_1815xgm,israelpalestine

A growing economy. A growing populace. It had work permits with Israel. It had comparable living conditions to the rest of the Middle East.

What do pro-Palestinians gain from all the lies spread about the fighting in the war?,"Here are a few examples:

- [Radio recording](https://x.com/_mai_daraja/status/1726750916563399042?s=20) of an Israeli soldier breaking down. Truth: this is fake. The soldier is speaking Hebrew with an Arab accent and names are stereotypical Jewish names ""Yuda"" and ""Yitzhak"" that are barely used in Israel now.
 
- Tweet claiming a [non-existant right hand of Netanyahu](https://x.com/Angryman_J/status/1726587630593491400?s=20) has been killed. Truth: this is actually an Israeli Arab officer from the Desert Reconnaissance Battalion, not an especially high ranking one either. He is still alive. And Netanyahu has no ""right hand"". [Another version](https://x.com/Campb37345Maree/status/1727111150687445380?s=20).

- Tweet showing [Hamas soldier saying his training was not necessary as the IDF is badly trainined and loses every battle](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1725306183676768323?s=20). Truth: Israel has conquered the Northern part of the Gaza strip at a rate faster than was planned and with less casualties than was feared before the land operation started.

- Tweet saying [around 3000 Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza so far](https://x.com/Megatron_ron/status/1726545917367472189?s=20). Truth: around 70 soldiers were killed in Gaza in the last month.

- Tweet saying [60 Israeli tanks are destroyed every day](https://x.com/YungravenCEO/status/1726943905210417336?s=20). Truth: Israeli tanks hold at least 3 people as crew. Casualty count does not coincide with this claim.

- Tweet saying [Netayhau lost a nephew and niece in the Gaza operation](https://x.com/SlavFreeSpirit/status/1724477465798553821?s=20). Truth: the soldier was killed but is not related to Netanyahu, and the female soldier is a stock photo. Her supposed name Barkitzi Matania Artzi which is not Israeli.

- Tweet saying an [IDF elite sniper was killed](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1722390859725906149?s=20). Truth: this sniper never existed and the name is not Israeli.

It seems that many of the big lies come from Malaysia, Arab countries and of course Jackson Hinkle.

How is it helpful to lie about the war situation in Gaza? The IDF soldiers and Hamas people in the strip know the truth. Those outside the strip, around the world, are basically creating their own confusion and fog of war.

Is Anti-Zionism intrinsically antisemitic? Can you be an Anti-Zionist and not an antisemite?,"I feel the more I try to gather perspectives on the conflict the more I'm inclined to feel they are one and the same. Because the Anti-Zionist position is simply logically unreasonable and it becomes impossible to support it without starting to distort reality or holding Israel to absurd standards well above any other country in the world while expecting absolutely nothing from the Palestinian side. 

I write this as a British person though I think the themes are somewhat similar across the 'west'. The political left has an interest in social justice but they don't realise that this is something that Anti-Zionists know and use to manipulate them. They end up being what might elsewhere be described as 'flying monkeys'. I suppose 'useful idiots' is another way of putting it. I see people slowly sinking down a rabbit hole where they start to say more and more concerning things that you wouldn't say about another group.

It doesn't take that long before someone is saying things that are classic antisemitism but replacing the word 'Jew' with 'Zionist' is somehow enough to make it righteous. I am not sure what to do about this as the people who are doing it seem to be completely unaware. Regardless of someone's intent I think it's quite antisemitic to be calling for the destruction of the only Jewish state on the planet based on flawed reasoning. 

So I ask the question because it's often stated that Jews and Zionism are not the same thing and therefore it is not antisemitic to be Anti-Zionist. The first point is true although I wonder about the second.

,"There has been discomfort among a group of non-Jewish MENAs to the concept of Jewish immigration from the 1880s. There was always a fear that the establishment of a Jewish state meant they wouldn't be allowed to live in their historic homeland. The Palestinian identity emerged with most national identities, around the 1830s. The claim to exclusive rights is ahistorical. There has never been a Palestinian State. But they've longed for statehood no less than Jews did. Israel developed into a multi-ethnic democracy.

The Levant is one of the oldest continuously inhabited areas in human history; pre anatomically modern humans. It was the land bridge from Africa to Eurasia. In re the extent populations, ""Israel"" as a sociocultural and political economic entity, was first documented in the archaeological record in the Mernotaphe Stele, c. 1208 BCE. The appelation, ""Palestine,"" first referred to the entire area between Phonecia and Egypt, in Greek by Herodotus, as a geographical term (c. 500 BCE) He got the name from the late bronze age people, the Philistines, which disappeared from history (c. 740 BCE); having been completely assimilated by other groups. The event that began the delineation of the Palestinian identity in a modern sense was an Arab peasant revolt in 1834 CE. Palestinians have a claim of indigeneity, they do not have the sole claim; nor do they have the oldest. They have heterogenous ancestry mixed with several groups. In addition to Palestinians, these are indigenous ancestry groups with direct traceable creation and descent which still exist all the way through to the present day.

Israel has ten million citizens who have the right to self-determination. The Palestinian people want to exercise the same right; but rhetoric has confounded reason. Anti-Zionism is about abbrogating the right of the Jewish people of the world to self determination. To what end? There has never been an exclusive claim to the territory in the Levant. What is the motivation? Rhetoric and literature of the Palestinian formation period would have you understand that anti-Zionism stems from anti-Jewish sentiments. A rejection of Jewish immigration to ""their"" area. 

You cannot separate the belief from the motivation. Explain why every culture under the heavens can self-determine but Israel cannot. If you take the original meanings, that it is about the creation and development of the Jewish state, then being against that means you are against the equal rights of Jews.",1,apenature,2023-11-23 02:20:06,kab4qsd,,comment,t3_18192ba,israelpalestine

If you’re advocating for the imposition of the destruction of Israel and its people, that’s antisemitic par excellence because you’re advocating for the end of Jewish lives en masse.",1,hammersandhammers,2023-11-23 02:18:19,kab4gza,,comment,t3_18192ba,israelpalestine
,"Yes, they can be mutually exclusive. However in practice it is seldom the case.

Can't be anti-Zionist and support other countries which have colonized with a special exception for Israel.

Can't be a pure anti-Zionist while strategically replacing the word Jew with Zionist.

Can't be a pure anti-Zionist while using Zionist as a derogatory term.

Can't be a pure anti-Zionist while denying the history of why Jews found a safe haven in Israel.

One of the only examples I know of a prominent pure anti-Zionist is Gabor Mate, a holocaust survivor himself. He is against Israel as an ethnostate with a clear history of making arabs/muslims second class citizens. No, it's not Apartheid and you shouldn't butcher the word by calling it that, but there was/is discrimination against them.

Can't be a pure anti-Zionist without delegating equal rights to the Jews of Israel. If you want to eradiate them, want revenge, you are an antisemite.

Can't be a pure anti-Zionist while calling Jews foreigners / non-indigenous. Jews have had a continuous presence in Israel and calling all Jews non-indigenous is false. Calling all Jews European is false.

Even if European Jews can return to Europe in relative safety. Good luck deporting Mizrahi Jews to their original host countries. Countries which to Jews are 1000000 times more hostile than Israel is to any Arab or Palestinian.

Now, is it inherently antisemitic to be antizionist? No, you might happen to be antizionist because you are opposed to any sort of nation-state, or because you're opposed to statss themselves (you're an anarchist), or because you *are* massively nationalistic and believe that Palestine is ""Arab land"" or something along those lines.

But generally, antizionism isn't intellectually consistent; these people are generally fine believing in one set of rules for most folks and a different set for Jews, which is antisemitism.

The US has no real intellectual left,"And it's exemplified in the absolute partisanship for the Hamas narrative and the demonization of Israel's response by left intellectuals who signed the open letter ""Philosophy for Palestine"". Judith Butler has been known to be a defender of Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as Angela Davis who has repeatedly demonized Israel. But even Nancy Fraser who used to be an opponent of post-modern theorists like Butler signed the letter that called Israel's reaction a ""genocide"" and didn't even mention the Hamas massacre. As a European leftist who has always been involved in American discourse and has been following and listening to American leftists online as well as in academia, I am incredibly torn inside learning that there is not even the most marginal, single bastion of leftist solidarity with Israel left in the US. 

My disillusionment didn't hit me unprepared. I had been researching and following the growing anti-Israel sentiments and their ties to the anti-imperialist movements during the Cold War, which were predominant on the left at that time, as well as the intellectual polarization of the left following the atrocities committed in the Middle East by the Bush administration after 9/11 for some time. Yet, I still cannot deny that I am shocked to see how the left's silence after the Hamas massacre and their zealous and hypocritical bluster starting immediately after Israel's reaction were and remain completely unobjected by all major American leftist intellectuals.

I don't know if anyone is aware of this, but the ideological schism between American leftists and in my case German leftists could not be greater during these times. And yes, I am aware of the fact that German leftists have a specific focus on their particular history, which doesn't mean that they are oblivious towards imperialism and American history in it however. But it seems like American leftists are completely lost in their narcissistic navel-gazing and self-flagellation rather than employing critical and universal analysis of global politics. I think it speaks for total intellectual ruin and I will no longer consult or appraise leftist intellectual work that comes out of the US academic machinery or anything adjacent to it.

It should have been clear from the start that a privatized educational apparatus will always be prone to become a tool for propaganda and looking at the amount of active and major donors located in Qatar and China, it is not necessary to put on a tinfoil hat to come to the conclusion that intellectuals who want to receive funding will need to provide a philosophical framework that creates a narrative in which these authoritarian systems will be romanticized, downplayed and white-washed. This stands against anything I value as a leftist and that's why American leftism is dead to me at this point. 

I urge everyone who can follow my sentiments not to give in to the reflex to wander off to the other political spectrum out of spite, frustration or desperation. There are no answers or solutions there either. Seek the connections across your country's borders.

It’s also important to highlight Israel under Netanyahu had made a dangerous political miscalculation that was always going to come home to roost and burn them. That being Israel under Netanyahu changed from being bipartisan supporters of both parties in America to taking a partisan pro-Republican stance. This was always shortsighted and political suicide for so many reasons. Namely the Democratic Party is the largest party in America and a party in which an overwhelming majority of American Jews and Muslims support.

,"It depends, the UN has their own refugee agency just for Palestinians because they don’t qualify as refugees by the traditional standards. The rule is essentially any Palestinians that do not live where they used to live including all their descendants are refugees so for example, it could be due to conflict but also fleeing, migration etc. As an example it could be that a place they lived was destroyed from war, they left place they lived such as a lot of people in Haifa when the Arab leaders told them to or some people migrated to countries like Jordan, Lebanon or the Americas. Most Gazans though have lived there for a while and have a different culture and slightly different genetic makeup than Palestinians in the PA and since Gaza was self ruling up until a month ago, they are not refugees no matter what anyone says. I live in America and my ancestors came here before the official first colonies were even established to escape conflict so does that make me a refugee?

,"from my point of view is a humanitarian issue. The sheer numbers, the dead children, entire families wipe outand you add that to the brutal rhetoric and actions of the israeli politicians and army. We have at least one confirmation that the family of a journalist was targeted, with the continues rhetoric that anything that breaths is hamas. This are not the action expected of a first world nation, ally of the western sphere. We saw the west pulling up when ukraine attacked and condemned the same atrocities that our leaders and media refuses to even acknowledge. Talking of the media, perhaps it was always like this but never been so clear a disconnection. We have what Israeli media tell themselves, we have what they say to our media and leaders and we have what our media and leaders tell to us, all of this when we have access to the horrors that occur on the ground. We have military objectives and tactics than reminds me of russia which we have spent 3 years scrutinizing, the amount of lies and cheap propaganda, the excuses etc... In my point of view the whole US, UK and others are partially responsible for refusing to bring to account an ally country, with their vetos and support no matter what, public opinions be damned. The only way i see a way out and a lasting peace is acountability, the removal of settlers and the entire deocupation.

Israeli Government Spokesman Says War Will Continue Even If All Hostages Are Released,"Under the deal, Israel has agreed to an additional one day pause in its bombing campaign for every 10 hostages Hamas releases.  
Appearing on Radio Four’s Today programme this morning, Levy said “The ball is firmly in \[Hamas’\] court”.  
He added: “If they do not want to release more hostages, we will continue and we will continue at full force to continue putting pressure on Hamas to release the hostages and ultimately to destroy that terror organisation.”  
Presenter Nick Robinson asked him: “Just to be clear, you’re saying even if they release them all, which is unlikely isn’t it, you would continue the war.”

Levy said: “Nick this war has to end with the end of Hamas. It means we’re going to totally destroy Hams’ military and governing structure inside the Gaza Strip, and we’re coming after every Hamas rocket launcher, every tunnel and every Hamas terrorist because if we don’t end it this time, there will be a next time and the next time will be worse because Hamas will be emboldened to attack us again.”  
The current conflict began after Hamas militants entered Israel on October 7, massacred 1,400 civilians and took a further 240 hostage.  
Meanwhile, Levy also called into questions claims by the Hamas-run Gaza health authority that Israel has killed 14,000 Palestinians in its bombing campaign.  
He said: “Those are the numbers being produced by Hamas, the same terror organisation that on October 7 burned, behaded, abducted babies and then lied about it. OK, so that is not a credible source.  
“So if you are asking me what are the exact casualty numbers, Nick, I can’t tell you exactly how many Israelis were murdered in the October 7 massacre because we still have body bags of unidentifiable human remains. We are still counting the damage and working out the exact death toll.”

He added: “We know that Hamas is exaggerating the numbers, you know that too. We also know that we’ve killed thousands of terrorists - a very large proportion of the total death toll.  
“When this war ends and we sum up the total combatants to civilian ratio and when you compare that to other counter-terrorism fought by western armies in urban areas, those numbers will show very clearly the lengths the Israeli army has gone in order to protect civilians and get them out of harm’s way.”",9,SaraShane,2023-11-23 17:56:44,181va6o,News/Politics,post,,israelpalestine

Look at the terrorists who controls the situation in Gaza ,"We were unaware that the West’s celebrated freedom meant abusing others at work, demeaning and degrading them, attempting to antagonize and harm them through various verbal means, then blaming them for their reactions, while the instigator is left untouched because they hold authority, power, and legal protection!
This imbecile, roaming the streets, seeking ways to harm others to satisfy his sadism,talks like a moron without any values or ethics to restrain his speech and behaves in an extremely childish manner. Can you believe that he was once a national security advisor in the United States? Yes, an adviser, not just any rank! And individuals like him are the ones who govern and dominate the major powers! 

Witness the extent of the legal violations committed by his excellency, the advisor, in just two minutes:
Snapping photos of others without consent, and with the intention of harming them. 
Threatening to contact his country’s intelligence to penalize his parents for no reason. Even if we assume that the Egyptian facing him was wrong, what is the guilt of his parents to be punished for his sake? Is this what the U.S law dictates? Disdain for the intelligence of other countries, as if it's a toy in his hands.Isn't individuals communicating with the intelligence of other countries another crime punishable by law?? Insulting Islam, and insulting our Prophet - peace and blessings be upon him -, and spreading lies, and insulting the Qur’an are among the gravest crimes. 
Where is the law that should hold him accountable?

Reflective Jew on Palestinian freedom,"For context, I am a Canadian born Jew. I was raised by Zionist parents from Belgium. Their parents are Holocaust survivors and the friends they grew up with are all children of Holocaust survivors. Which helps me understand their deep love and need for a Jewish state. I grew up with this love and the word 'zionist' was only positive for me until I entered the world of academia. 

As I became an adult and started learning more about the history I was not taught - details of some Zionist extremism/terrorism, Palestinian displacement, etc, I started to become much more critical of the Israeli government. The extreme right wing government of the last 20 years is widely understood at this point as a huge instigator of the current conflict and I think it is inevitable and understandable that a desperate population will lead to extremism and terrorism as the Israeli govt upheld the status quo of Palestinians as second class citizens or stuck within an open air prison or subjected by settlement expansion and settler violence, all with support from the most sophisticated Military in the world (or at least in the region). Israel's current response is showing us horrible images of death and destruction to Palestinians. It is an outcome of war that will never be justifiable. War never can be justified. 

On October 7, 2023, I was horrified. My friends were murdered or taken hostage. My family was hiding in their homes, and the world very quickly (before Israel's response) showed clear antisemitic tropes and justifications for the horrendous atrocities by Hamas. It was and continues to be a scary time for jews. I have family in Canada who are not sending their kids to school, who have been jumped by Arab gangs, and homes vandalized with Jewish stars. My family removed their Jewish jewelry and I don't think they will be wearing it publicly for the rest of their lives. I find that sad. But that's not the point of this post. 

For the last 1.5 months I have been listening to and reading from Palestinian poets, authors, academics. I have been trying to understand the future and possibility of peace that moderate palestians envision and I am deeply confused by the future they see. Across the board, when presented with what kind of peaceful solution they envision, it is always pretenced by:
- envisioning a world without borders
- a world without military
- a middle east without any Jewish sovereignty 
- persistence on the right to return to their homes in occupied land

Why this confuses me and what they seem to always gloss over:
- we live in a world with borders and that is not going to change. 
- we live in a world of extremism and Islamic jihad is a serious threat globally
- this next point is informed by my intergenerational trauma, but I believe that Jews need a military because of the proven historical record of Jewish oppression and murder. People want to keep killing us
- the outcome of the 9 wars that Israel has had since it's establishment, has led to land occupation. I am not saying it is fair to the people who were displaced. But from everything I have read, these wars were initiated by Arab nations or after intifadas, and when a country wins a war, they usually keep the land. 
- Palestinian leadership continues to fail it's people. Whether by corruption or extremism. 

So, I believe Palestinians deserve their own land, not occupied by Israel and led by some form of democratic government that focuses on providing them with human decency. I do not believe that is the responsibility of Israel to establish. Israel is a country that has developed over 75 years, with its own problems and issues and population. Palestinians need help from the rest of the world to establish this country and Israel needs to be at the table because they play a huge role in ensuring that this can happen safely at their borders. 

So, I ask this community, please challenge me on what I believe because this is my current understanding and I intend to expand, grow and change it based on more information and peaceful debate. I am do desperate for peace but I don't see how it can be achieved based on the demands and vision of Palestinians I have exposed myself to.",18,FunAioli773,2023-11-22 19:36:54,1814kof,,post,,israelhamaswar

I think you nailed it. The onus of building a state is on the Palestinians and anyone (seems like the entire world) willing to support them. The first step is getting the terrorism under control with the help of whoever and then going back to Israel and negotiating a peace deal. 

The problem is that they don't actually *want* a state. You're projecting your western values onto the Arabs & Palestinians. You want them to want a state. What they want is Jihad and Islam and Struggle against the immoral west. The state may be a convenient narrative but it's the journey they are after and not the destination.

,"First, you should start by unlearning all the things they told you about Israel in the world of academia, as you put it. Almost everything you said about Israel is just factually wrong. 
>The extreme right wing government of the last 20 years is widely understood at this point as a huge instigator of the current conflict
        
The current conflict started as a result of the massacre of some 1200 men, women, child and the elderly and the abduction of 240, not by any Israeli action. In fact, Israel has ***never*** instagated a war, unless you count preemptive strike, which the six day war would count (though it was clear by any account that war was imminent). 
>Palestinians as second class citizens

Depending on your definition, they are either not 2nd class or not citizens at all. Israeli Arabs have full equal rights and are the freest Arabs in the middle east. WB/Gaza Palestinians are not citizens. Israel never annexed WB/Gaza and they are not part of its territory. They are under Israeli control (or were in the case of Gaza until 2005), similar to how the entire area was under British control and then Egyptian/Jordanian control. I don't remember anyone ever having British/Egyptian/Jordanian voting rights back then. Areas that were annexed, namely the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, received Israeli citizenship and have equal rights (in the case of E.Jerusalem, it's opt-in).
> stuck within an open air prison 

It's called a border, which conveniently they also share one with Egypt. Perhaps Canada is an open air prison as well, flanked on two sides by the US.
>or subjected by settlement expansion 

Despite what you may have read on twitter, the Israeli gov't doesn't actually build anything. Settlements which are build illegally on land that is not owned, are demolished by the Israeli gov't. Now if you want to make the claim that Jews shouldn't be allowed to buy land from Palestinians and build settlements on top of those lands, then you'd feel right at home in the PA. In fact they have a law against selling land to Jews, punishable by death. As far as them being a hindrance to peace (ignoring the fact the Palestinians are not interested in peace), Israel is 2 for 2 on dismantling settlements for peace (Egypt peace deal, 2005 Gaza disengagement). Hasn't really worked out the last time. 
>and settler violence

Police can't prevent crime, they can only arrest those responsible and have them prosecuted by the judicial system. I do have a question for you. There are currently Israelis in Israeli prisons for crimes against Palestinians. How many Palestinians are in Palestinian prisons for crimes against Israelis?
>Israel's current response is showing us horrible images of death and destruction to Palestinians

This is all on Hamas and the people who elected it and to this day still support it and its barbaric acts. Actions have consequences. 
>War never can be justified. 

If after seeing what has happen on Oct. 7th you still feel that, the title of 'useful idiot' fits you like a glove. 

> I am deeply confused by the future they see

This is actually quite simple, you are not part of the future they see. Palestinians as a whole, do not accept a two state solution (only 17% in favor in recent poll). Be it because they genuinely are not interested in peace, or because the militant fringe has taken over and brainwashed everyone is irrelevant. Regardless of any possible Israeli actions a peace agreement is not within the realm of possibility in the foreseeable future.",31,BDB-ISR-,2023-11-22 21:11:15,kaa70mp,,comment,t3_1814kof,israelhamaswar

,"It's possible that peace could happen soon.  This would require the PA to change leadership, denounce terrorism, accept that they will need to make difficult compromises, and strive for peace.  There is a pathway to that result, based on what is going on right now.

However, that is unlikely.  I don't think peace will come any time soon.  Something to consider:  What you see today cannot be viewed in a vacuum and the right-wing Israeli government is a reaction to the PA's rejection of peace, not the reason for it.  Remember, they were offered literally everything they asked for.  Everything.  It was rejected and a years-long violent uprising was the response.  This same thing happened again years later.  Many Israelis basically took the position of ""fuck it, if they don't want peace, neither do we, so fuck those fuckers.""",4,nightlyraver,2023-11-23 01:40:26,kaayy8n,,comment,t3_1814kof,israelhamaswar
,"Palestinian liberation should not come at the expense of Israeli sovereignty; Israeli sovereignty should not come at the expense of Palestinian freedom.

The trouble is that Israel's top priority has always been to exist in peace, whereas Palestine's top priority has always been for Israel to not exist, at the expense of peace.

Only when Palestinians value their own statehood above eliminating Israel's will there be any hope.

>    Israel is asked to give Palestinian civilians time to flee Gaza before its military campaign begins — and then denounced for creating a “nakba” by forcing Palestinians to flee their homes.

"Seriously, stop with the “genocide” claims.","The definition of genocide is:

“the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group.”

There are many prominent figures repeating again and again that Israel is committing genocide. It’s actually disgraceful. It’s an insult to the many genocides that have actually occurred in the last 50 years that no one cares about or even knows of.

Let me explain why the genocide claims are not true.

- Israel has no stated intention of committing genocide. The genocidal statements of some Israeli governments officials and representatives are not evidence of stated intention. They’re just a few peoples edgy opinions that are not carried out in a tangible way.

- Approximately 60,000 Palestinians have died since 1948, and most of the deaths have been during war periods. This averages out to about 800 per year. For reference, the Nazis killed about 1.5 million Jews per year between 1941 and 1945.

- The Palestinian population has gone up 4x since 1948. And the Gazan population has doubled since 2000.

- Israel have Gaza back in 2005. If they were hell bent on genocide, why would they do that.

- Israel supplies Gaza with free water and electricity (until recently). A very strange thing to do if you are wanting to commit genocide.

- Israel provides Palestinians with jobs and income. Another peculiar thing to do if one’s intent is to commit genocide.

- Israel has tried to offer the Palestinians their own state that they can have autonomy over. A very very ridiculous thing to do if you wanted to eradicate a nation or group of people.

- Israel provides humanitarian aid to Gazans. Furthermore, Israel built and funded a lot of the infrastructure in Gaza in the 80s and 90s to prop it up and promote health services. Weird for a genocidal country to do that.

- Death toll =/= genocide. Yes, understanding 10,000 plus Gazans have died, is not evidence of genocide. You must understand why and how they have died. Did America commit genocide against the Japanese, Iraqis, Afghans and Germans? Did England commit genocide against the Germans, Turks and Italians? No of course not. They were fighting and the unfortunate result was loss of civilians life. That is not evidence of genocide.

Yes, I’m sure you can point to a few people in the Israeli government who have said some not so smart things about solving the Palestine issue. And you can also point to bad apples in the IDF who have acted out of line and been disciplined for it. However, this is not evidence of genocide. You actually have to commit genocide to be accused of genocide. I’m also referring to Raz Segal, Owen Jones and Norman Finkelstein. Their claims are ridiculous, especially coming from University professors and I urge them to look at the many other genocides that have actually occurred and study those to understand what an actual genocide looks like.",267,goodstopstore,2023-11-25 21:50:25,183h8yc,,post,,israelpalestine

,"Was going to make my own post till I saw this. Here’s what I’ll add, was just going to be my post

Genocide

I thought I’d weigh in on this topic as I’ve seen this word thrown around a lot over the past month. Ill start by make my stance clear, so that if you oppose my viewpoint & have no interest in changing your mind you can skip straight to commenting, Israel is not committing a genocide, an ethnic cleansing could be argued. 

Genocide - let’s begin by establishing a definition. Many people, different bodies, hell even the UN will have their own definitions for what constitutes a genocide. The UN defines genocide as “a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part” I believe it later adds different caveats/addendums but my issue is the statement “in part” this is super ambiguous. Because of this I prefer the Oxford dictionary definition “the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group” large may still be somewhat ambiguous but it conveys at least the severity of killing required to rise to the level of genocide. What both, and really all, definitions share in common though is that the intent must be to destroy a nation or group. 

With that in mind let’s refocus on Israel v. Gaza. When determining what constitutes “intent to destroy a nation or group”, and what qualifies as “a large number of people” it’s important to look at the number of people killed, vs’s the population, over a given period of time; however, what I believe is equally important is to weigh this against the capabilities the given entity has for destruction. 

So when we look at the situation in Gaza we have a population of 2 million people under siege. Over the past month we have seen roughly 12,000 casualties, with no real way to verify combatant vs’s civilian. To put this number into perspective we have to look at Israel’s capabilities. In ww2 the US killed 80-100,000 Japanese in a bombing campaign of Tokyo, not the atomic bomb for those who don’t know. Tokyo today has a population density of around 16,000 per square mile, 6.1k/km, and Gaza city has around 21,000 per square mile, 8.1k/km. So does Israel have the destructive capabilities of a ww2 US, I would have to say yes, they could certainly inflict damage of that scale. 

So why have we only seen around 10k deaths in a month? Israel has not carpet bombed, indiscriminately bombed, or intentionally targeted civilians. They have given multiple opportunities for civilians to leave, and have even provided protection to them as they evacuated. Israel is very clearly targeting Hamas & not attempting to commit a genocide, if they wanted to they could. As I said an ethnic cleansing could be argued based on what follows this campaign but a genocide is ludicrous to argue. 

On the other hand Hamas…do they rise to the level of a ww2 US? Absolutely not, they look like a Stone Age power in comparison. So when we look at October 7th, while keeping in mind what they are capable of, does that rise to the level of a genocide? I would actually argue Yes. They came in intentionally targeting civilians, they killed 1200 people which is likely the upper limit of what their military is capable of, and their stated goal is to eradicate Israel.",1,Aeraphel1,2023-11-26 11:19:18,karqg1h,,comment,t3_183h8yc,israelpalestine

The Silence From International Bodies Over Hamas' Mass Rapes Is a Betrayal of All Women,"Elkayam, of the Civil Commission gathering evidence of Hamas's sexual abuse, reiterated the betrayal she says all women felt from UN bodies' failure to condemn Hamas's crimes against women and young girls. “Their silence is deafening,” [Elyakam](https://www.timesofisrael.com/global-womens-rights-groups-silent-as-israeli-women-testify-about-rapes-by-hamas/amp/) said. 

At the Nova music festival, where more than 350 young people were slaughtered and dozens kidnapped, witnesses hiding in the bushes saw terrorists [gang-rape](https://www.newsweek.com/silence-international-bodies-over-hamas-mass-rapes-betrayal-all-women-opinion-1845783), then murder and mutilate women. A Hamas video from a kibbutz shows terrorists torturing a pregnant woman and removing her fetus.

The International Day for the Prevention of Violence against Women is observed every November 25. I would like to see how the world -and particularly the United Nations General Assembly- intends on addressing the issues of rape committed by Hamas.

,"I think that many (not all) of the people denying the rape and sexual violence accusations (a) would probably not do so if Israelis were the ones being accused of raping Palestinians; and (b) are concerned that if the rape accusations turned out true, that might force them to reconsider their views—because, of course, no one wants to support rapists—and they like their clean, black-and-white narrative, where Israel is the eternal aggressor and Palestinians are always just victims. So, they’ll engage in denial and set an unreasonably high bar for evidence, e.g., they’d demand video evidence of someone getting raped (and murdered) that was sent directly to their inbox by  verified Hamas spokesman because “IDF always lies” and antisemitic conspiracy theories about the media or whatever. I think that, given what we know from testimonies and footage from survivors and operatives (and facts about Hamas), the likelihood of sexual violence is extremely high. That’s why I have more respect for people, like Norman Finkelstein, who acknowledge the brutality but still won’t condemn Hamas than tepid liberals who deny the brutality because they can’t handle the thought that the victim-underdog-freedom-fighters they support could be ‘morally tainted’.",1,Concrete_Cancer,2023-11-26 08:29:57,kaqzytl,,comment,t3_183j2m9,israelpalestine

"Hamas, Al-Quaeda, the Taliban, ISIS, etc worship death rather than celebrating life.","Let’s ignore October 7th and go back to 9/11. The day following the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001, CBS (I think it was) showed a clip of Palestinian women dancing in the streets after hearing of the deaths of 2,700-odd Americans in New York, after terrorist attacks. I have a sneaking suspicion that that video was pulled soon after, since I never saw it again, and the subject matter was never mentioned. But that was enough for me. I have been anti-Palestine and pro-Israel ever since, because I have no sympathy for anyone, of any country, who would gleefully celebrate the deaths of over 2,700 innocent victims. It takes a very special kind of evil, disgusting, warped and inhumane mind to behave like that. 

Were 9/11 terrorists also “freedom fighters” or “resistance fighters”? Fighting the occupation? 

Now back to October 7th, watching hundreds of Palestinians laughing, dancing and celebrating in the streets after the Hamas atrocities, I stopped having sympathy for them, how about you?

[Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-bright-line-between-good-and-evil) very eloquently put it “Israel’s behavior is not what explains the suicidal and genocidal inclinations of a group like Hamas.

,"I am saying this as someone who was born in Palestine, grew up in both Palestine and Jordan, a Muslim who studied in a Christian school, lived and worked in the US and Europe for more than 5 years collectively.

First of all, I firmly believe that all ethnicities, religions, movements, nations, you name it. The majority (> 95%) of the people who belong to it, are just normal people who are just trying to move through life by getting the sense of belonging to something, a compass for their actions, and a community. While the rest are extremists who are ruining it for everyone because usually they are the loudest.

For the Palestinian woman dancing, there is on the opposite side Israelis grabbing popcorn and watching Israel bombing Gaza. For the Palestinians dancing on October 7th, some Israelis were making tiktoks and reels mocking Gazans who do not have water or electricity. There are bad apples on all sides.

Also, all people are impulsive and dont take the whole context when they are reacting to something. A funny example I can think of, at the start of Covid, it was reported that in NY, Uber drivers were rejecting the requests of Asian people haha. 

The US is a great great country IMO, I think it has a very good influence on the world in general. But, during this process, they have made many lives miserable as well, and they will for sure gain so many haters, and rightfully so tbh. They have staged coups all over the world, started or participated in so many wars.

Death is not celebrated in the Islamic concept at all, and the life of humans is sacred as in any other religion, they just have a different perspective of dying in pursuit of defending your country, or in war. The same in the US, almost every event I attended, there was some kind of appreciation or celebration to the veterans, do the US people worship wars? No, they just have a great perspective of someone risking and dedicating their lives for their country and people, and I am not American, but I got goosebumps every time I saw this. Everything goes both ways in so many beliefs and cultures.

Now, the 9/11 attacks are horrible, by all means. And there is no way on earth that you could justify or defend that. But for the Palestinian woman, who most probably did not think through when she danced, for her the US is part of why Israel has been able to build settlements in the West bank (it is not important for her if it is legal or not), she might have been kicked out of her home because of that, she knows a lot of people who were killed because of that or the whole conflict. She was happy when the US was harmed.

If you ask an Iraqi mother now about the US, who might have lost her children in the war, she might be happy if an earthquake occurred in the US.

Some US citizens were celebrating the Trump Muslim ban, a lot of US citizens in the 40's and 50's said the Nuclear bombs were a very good idea, because they have lost relatives and friends in pearl harbor.

We are really really complicated humans, most of us want to just live in peace, and have a decent life, and we are also weak, so when who we thought are our enemies get attacked, we get the sense that we got a little bit of a revenge, someone got the revenge of my dead son, my dead friend.

Anyone else annoyed by the hostage exchange?,"Not only is the whole process dragging out on purpose, likely to Hamas advantage but the entire moral equivalency here is just absurd.  Regardless of which side you take, the way it's playing out is the following:

A bunch of convincted prisoners who were taken care of in an Israeli prison are being exchanged in a wild ten to one ratio for toddlers and women who did not harm a single soul.  Hostages who were rotting in some tunnel and unlikely to have received similar kind of care.

What in the world?

Am I missing something?  I get that Israel values life more than Hamas, but this is such a lopsided and immoral swap.  I only hope that those released do not have actually have blood on their hands.  Imagine if a prisoner was let go and actually killed Israelis, the anguish that family must feel.

There are also claims that many prisoners in Israel are still awaiting trial, but not sure if those are included in the swap.

The moral state of Palestine is deplorable at best,"Call it whatever you like, blame it on your so called occupation and apartheid state (which by the way, any sane person from South Africa would laugh at the comparison), but what ever it is, the moral state of the Palestinian “society”, if you can call it that is so deplorable that they have failed as a people.

Their education, horrible and entirely based on hate and murder.

Their economy, non-existent.

Their civic structure is a joke.

Socially speaking they will eat each other out for collaboration or worse yet for even speaking moderately which will lead to no advancement in any dialogue.

What democratic principles? They’ve had the same corrupt government since forever and they complain why life is difficult.

If given a state, it would be come a failed state of whiners and beggars within a short year.

I don’t see a future for Palestinians in any way.

No, most South Africans are pro Palestine and have no problem calling Israel an Apartheid state. We'll also never forget Israel was Apartheid South Africa's staunchest ally, and happily sold them weapons to be used against the black indigenous population.

""It is unclear, however, how many white Afrikaner Pentecostal Protestant converts to Judaism are among them. But a recent report in the Haaretz newspaper claimed that such converts had been arriving in Israel in increasing numbers since the end of apartheid in South Africa in the mid-1990s.

""From a former Pentecostal pastor to entire families, a growing number of Afrikaners are converting to Orthodox Judaism and swapping South Africa for Israel,"" wrote Haaretz's Judy Maltz, ""and, in many cases, West Bank settlements.”""

Why doesn’t anyone talk about the Palestinians ALSO getting expelled from Kuwait in 1990s,"So let’s lay this out…. 

The Arabs lose the sovereignty of their land after they lose WW1 and become occupied under the British mandate. They fought on the side of the central powers as part of the Ottoman Empire. They helped the allied powers by BETRAYING the ottoman’s under the ruse of the Brit’s promising them an independent state… to me this shows they are willing to do anything for their religious agenda. Yes the Brit’s double crossed them but why would you trust your enemy who’ve you’ve killed …. 

In 1990-1991 Iraq invaded Kuwait (this was the pretext for the US Iraq war btw). After we get Iraq out by excessive force, Kuwait expelled 300k Palestinians for supporting and aiding Iraq…. The same way they are supporting and aiding Hamas which is literally a puppet gov of Iran… (edited I originally said Hamas was a puppet gov to Iraq and not Iran. Iran although demographically diff equal parts horrible) 

It also just makes historical sense. The Brit’s aka the west, double crossed them so now they want revenge so they teamed up with Iran like they did with Iraq, as both countries vow total destruction and domination of the west…

What I’m saying here is the Palestinian people have a literal HISTORY of terrorism and aiding terrorist. From a media perspective Iran is doing what we did to iraq during the Kuwait invasion. They are utilizing the David and Goliath narrative to appeal to western sympathy . They literally use us like they use the Palestinians …. 

This regime has no care for human life. The Palestinians people are not infants. At some point they need to stop calling Israel oppressors and start looking at who is really oppressing them… themselves 

My fellow westerners who genuinely mean well you are harming these people far more than you are helping them. Some times tough love is needed and I feel like the Palestinians need to start looking inward

Palestinians are Human Shields,"I am an American Jew. I am old enough to have grown up having relatives who died in the Holocaust and some that escaped it as children. Hence Israel. I know the history. That the conception of Jewish State dates backs at least to Herzl.

What I also understand is the anti- Israeli/anti-semitic sentiment rearing it's ugly head to the surface again. Israel has every right to defend itself. They were struck first in a surprise attack. Israel literally trains for this. Every able man or woman spends a mandatory two years in the militia training for this moment.

Hamas has used the Palestinian people through Iranian influence to be their human shield.  I feel badly for the Palestinian people as well. But Hamas, a terrorist group, will not give up it's leaders and members. They continue to hide in Gaza, hence the Israeli ground invasion. They let the Palestinian people, who even before this strike upon Israel, were not doing  well, hang out to dry and the world blames Israel. I won't even go into how this is already spreading to strategic U.S. bases in the Mediterranean. When our soldiers are being killed, Americans will feel however they feel then.  I am guessing a, ""Go Back to Israel"", stance.

I proudly stand with Israel. I am a Jew, because I was born a Jew. Although there are a couple converts in the family. This might be genocide to the rest of the world, even with 4 day cease fire, but for me, if Hamas surrendered like they expect Israel to do, there would be no war.

There is no independent verification.

Apparently it was an accident. She’s a mother and she had her masters thesis discussion the next day, which wouldn’t make sense that she’d attempt an attack. (Info I gathered from Aran news outlets)

Wikipedia says it was an attempted attack. And the IDF soldier testified that she was driving straight towards him and she yelled “ allahu akbar “ before the explosion.

Something keeps coming up for me. Palestinians are literally treated as second class citizens in countries like Lebanon, remain refugees even under their own  governments (Hamas and PA).

,"Have you ever heard that Israel is a state that practices apartheid?

They cheated on you. Give yourself a reality check. Israel is the only country in the Middle East where Arabs (Muslims or Christians) and Jews have the same rights and opportunities.

If you are going to argue to me that people in the Palestinian territories live under oppression, first find out that the Palestinian territories have their own governments. So the concept of apartheid does not apply anywhere.

 In 1993, they were given autonomy FOR THE FIRST TIME in the most populated areas of the West Bank. In 2005, they were given full autonomy in Gaza.

That DESTROYS the possibility of talking about an Israeli apartheid.

What is apartheid?
It is when a government imposes TWO different LEGAL FRAMEWORKS (one of a discriminatory type) on its own citizens.
But Palestinians do not live in Israel, nor are they Israeli citizens.

How can apartheid be imposed on them, if they live OUTSIDE the country?
Strictly speaking, talking about Israeli apartheid is idiotic.
Arabs who do live in Israel and are Israelis, live under THE SAME LEGAL FRAMEWORK as any other citizen, Jew or Christian.

Those are the objective facts.
There is no occupation.
There is no colonial dynamic.
There is no apartheid (it is not possible, in fact).

You better internalize: Israel will not stop until the bitter end,"Simple rationale: Hamas standing on its legs in Gaza means Israel lost. It means Israeli citizens will refuse back to areas around Gaza and prove they are right about the idea of cleansing Israel of Jews.

We don't trust the world to remove Hamas in peaceful ways. We don't trust the world to maintain ceasefire borders. The world won't spill its soldiers blood for this conflict.

Israelis are willing to pay any price in order to remove Hamas, so there are only two viable options to stop the carnage in Gaza:

1. Hamas fully surrendered or eradicated from existence. The longer he fights, the more Gaza suffers.

2. All-arab coalition to assault on Israel (won't happen, they barely manage to agree on condemnation)

Another could be the sense of weakening support for Hamas in Gaza, particularly as Gazans were being permitted to work within Israel. This will undoubtably stop that completely which is a victory for Hamas.

Lastly, you shouldn't underestimate the effect of having Gaza in the collective West spotlight. It could be harder for Israel to continue their policies after the war, and as much as they pride themselves on ""going it alone"", having less friends is not a good outcome.

Hamas wont be destroyed unless Israel razes Gaza to the ground, and Hamas knows this. Whether Gazan support for Hamas becomes stronger after the war will be important to see. When half the population is children was is an effective way to indoctrinate against Israel.

Muslims killing Muslims is not a big deal.,"What is Israel doing differently against Hamas than Saudi against Houthis?

Why is Israel being protested by mobs worldwide and called genocidal while the death toll in Yemen is much higher without one protest or call for a ceasefire?

Saudi says Houthis use hospitals for military purposes. 

Both of these wars are against Iranian proxies, and they seem identical.

Yet we don’t see Saudis dropping leaflets and evacuation notices, nor do Saudis call the residents telling them to evacuate before striking.

Anti-Saudi media claims that Saudi Arabia killed 150,000 people in Yemen while Hamas claims Israel killed 14,000 people.

The death toll in Yemen since 2014 for the war is 370,000 in total including death by starvation, Gaza since 1967 is nowhere near that number.

You cannot have double standards and protest against Israel and not Saudi, or think Saudi is doing something acceptable but not Israel.

It’s easier to hate Israel because it’s Jews vs Muslims. That way it’s easier to pick sides. But when Saudi Arabia does it it’s Arab vs Arab. Also, Saudi Arabia having Mecca and Medina might have a role to play in this.

,"I would say there is 2 main reasons for this particular case. 

1st is our media and politicians( at least the ones where i am, media and politicians vary depending which country in the west you look at).  They is a debate and criticism of Saudi policies and actions, there is a debate in the sale of arms to saudi, and our media and politicians that are more inclined to work with the saudis defend it as necessary for fuel stability and as ME stability(their 2 main points at least). When it comes to Israel and is policies and its actions, ALL debate is shut down, people get fired left and right for any criticism, reports are censored and reconstruct as needed. There is no deviation of the line neither in main media nor in the main political parties and this cross a lot of people. The clear differences and stark levels of closing any and all criticism simply alienate most people.

2nd is social media, unfortunately for yemenis, they dont have phones, their videos dont reach us. Palestinians do, we can see in real time dead children pulled from the rubble as we see in our news that the israeli dont target civlians, we can see 24/7 as videos and photos of the dead, and most of them children, pile up.

,"A burglar breaks into a home and holds the husband and wife in it hostage. (Disclaimer: I believe this is OC because I heard it in Cantonese and I've translated it, so also, apologies for bad English)

A burglar breaks into a home and holds the husband and wife in it hostage. At gunpoint, he forces the two to sit on chairs facing the opposite way, back to each other, and ties them to the chairs. The burglar slowly and methodically begins stealing from the house.

When the burglar has taken everything of value, he gets ready to leave, the homeowners still bound to their chairs, when suddenly, the man yells at the burglar,

""Please untie her, please, let her go!""

The thief responds with,

""No, I'm not untying either of you so that the authorities get notified as late as possible. Don't worry, your neighbours will soon wonder why your lights are still on throughout the night and check in on you long before you succumb to dehydration""

The man yet again pleads,

""Please, just untie her, I'll do anything!""

The burglar once again explains his reasoning,

""I need to get away with this crime, I'm sorry, I can't leave anything up to chance.""

The man shuffles his chair towards the burglar, in a state of mania, exclaims,

""I'm begging you man, just let her go, she won't call the cops, I promise!""

The burglar, still unwilling to budge, did find it quite touching how much his hostage cared about his wife.

""Wow,"" he said ""You must really love your wife to beg me to untie her so desperately""

""No,"" The man replied, in a state of frenzy ""My wife will be home in 15 minutes""",29,Alternative_Case_878,2023-11-26 04:20:36,kapvrig,,comment,t3_183ncf2,AskMiddleEast

The way they rigged this exchange deal,"You must have came across some pro-Israeli posts/comments along the lines of "" we exchanging hostages for criminals/terrorist"" to which every single one of them will reference the case of [Nafaz Hamad](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-just-convicted-of-stabbing-her-neighbor-may-be-freed-in-hamas-deal/) stabbing her neighbor so I took the liberty of looking through some of the other charges of the  other released hostages and oh boy to list some:

\- Hanan el Bargouthy 60 years old lady; has 4 sons in Israeli prisons (2 captured after Oct 7th) and her brother is currently in prison (spent 43 years total in prison), sentence : 4 months of which she spent 2.5 months and she didn't commit anything... she was just arrested for visiting her family members without messing a beat when she can

\-Zeina Abdo, 6 months sentence over being anti-Israel on social media and she get to see her graduation from high-school

\-Marah Bakeer, spent 8 years in prison, accused of trying to stab an IDF soldier on her way back from school at 16 !!!

\-Fatma Sahin, alsco accused of planning to stab an IDF soldier, her father was shot during her arrest

\-Amany El-Hsheem, got a masters degree and was sentenced for 10 years over a driving accident that involved an IDF check point in which no one was hurt.... spent 7 years in prison

In a nutshell, all the ones I have checked out are fabricated/malicious accusations and most of them actually spent the majority of their sentence... and they just deliberately added/agreed to add Nafaz Hamad (whose case is so popularized and was used to push more hate/anti-palestinian sentiments) to the list with the pre-mediated agenda to slander and push this toxic narrative of we exchange criminals for hostages",38,Faisalowningyou,2023-11-25 16:53:55,183cwxh,:thoughts_face: Thoughts?,post,,AskMiddleEast

,"Well, first of all, the majority of Palestinians do support Hamas as well as the Oct 7 attacks. Here is a recent poll by AWRD: [https://www.awrad.org/files/server/polls/polls2023/Public%20Opinion%20Poll%20-%20Gaza%20War%202023%20-%20Tables%20of%20Results.pdf](https://www.awrad.org/files/server/polls/polls2023/Public%20Opinion%20Poll%20-%20Gaza%20War%202023%20-%20Tables%20of%20Results.pdf)

See pg 12-13 Tables 27-29

Second of all, it is obvious that the biggest thing oppressing the people the past hundred years has been the Palestinian leaders. With the war in Gaza, it is Hamas, who have been the worst of all. Not only getting Israel to attack them but since they came to power, funneling in billions of dollars in humanitarian aid for the people to build massive terror tunnel networks, make the leaders filthy rich, and amass weapons. They care only about annihilating Israel and not about the people. Some Palestinians know this, but most have been brainwashed their entire life by the narrative. If Hamas loses, and they will, the people will probably not get a state until there is a competent leadership. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank/Judea & Samaria has just come out denying Hamas carried out the Oct 7 atrocities and claims that the IDF did it to their own people to justify killing Palestinians. He of course did his dissertation on Holocaust denial. What the Palestinian people need is a smart leader who is not trying to go to war (again) with Israel at the expense of the people, and for this leader to have support rather than getting assassinated for wanting to make concessions in order to build a state and coexist in peace with its neighbor, who is not going anywhere. In my view, we are not going to see real peace in this region for a couple of centuries.

"I'm going to take the opportunity to explain to you why woke people are, in reality, the most RACIST people.","1. I'm going to tell you about an interesting case (a moron who lost her job because she was anti-Semitic), and along the way I'm going to take the opportunity to explain to you why woke people are, in reality, the most RACIST people.
And I don't mean that they hate white people, but they hate Palestinians.

2. Professor Laura Mullen has just lost her job as a professor at Wake Forest University (private), where she was also in charge of the Humanities office in the area of ​​Creative Writing in English.
All this was triggered by a tweet.

3. After the 7/10 terrorist attack in Israel, Mullen took up all the anti-Israel myths about plunder and land theft, and said that in a situation like that she would also be tempted to massacre boys dancing at a party.

4. He was referring to the massacre perpetrated by Hamas at a music festival, which left more than 250 boys of various nationalities murdered in cold blood.
The reactions were immediate. Withering criticism immediately came.

5. The university clarified, at the time, that they respected the right to freedom of expression of all people, but that Mullen's comments had been hateful and were against the human values ​​promoted there.
Mullen was fired.

6. Oh well, she said that she ""resigned for personal reasons."" Cheap euphemism.
Anyway, she complained bitterly that the university didn't want to defend her (!), and she said they hadn't understood that her tweet was meant to be ""raw, direct and poetic.""
She literally said it.

7. In her attempt to justify herself, she added:
""I don't believe in clear lines between victims and perpetrators. That terrorism comes from a vacuum... that doesn't mean I condone terrorism. I'm very concerned about what happens to innocent people around the world...

8. ""...My tweet reflected my understanding of the history and results of oppression.""
Nothing to comment on these phrases full of clichés and common places. Perhaps just highlighting that he is concerned about what happens to innocent people everywhere, except in Israel.

9. But the most interesting thing was something else she added:
""When 9/11 happened I asked myself and others: What have we done to people to make them come and do this to us? That's how my mind works.""
This is the phrase that interests me, because that is where she exhibited her RACISM.

9. Talking about the 9/11 attacks (Twin Towers) is talking about the terrorist actions of one of the most violent, aggressive and important groups in the history of modern terrorism: Al Qaeda.
We are not talking about improvised ones, but about true professionals.

10. Al Qaeda, like the large Salafi groups, maintained (or maintains, what remains of them) an agenda focused on the extremist concept of JIHAD, holy war, and which aims to subject the entire world to Islam.

11. They adhere to an extreme and medieval vision (note: rejected by current Muslim clerics) in which all humanity must convert to Islam, or submit to the rule of Muslims.
Jihad, in essence, is an imperialist and colonialist project.

12. A fundamental aspect is what they consider ""reconquest"" of everything that was already territory dominated by Islam. If that territory was lost to an enemy, it must be ""liberated"", because once governed by Islam, it must ALWAYS be so because it is ""holy land"".

13. Hamas is another Salafist group, identical to Al Qaeda in its doctrinal bases (or ISIS). Their fight against Israel is just that, a religious crusade based on the fact that what is today Israel was already governed by Islam, and therefore should not be governed by Jews.

14. It is not a land conflict in the sense of ""this is my nation"", but in the sense of ""it is your nation, but since it was already ruled by Islam, you have to agree to submit to us, or leave.""
As you can well guess, this idea is not limited to Israel.

15. Spain was already under the rule of Islam. Almost all of it. At the most critical moment, only a small strip of the Asturias area was free.

16. A good piece of Europe too, when the maximum expansion of the Ottoman Empire was achieved.
Check out all those regions:

17. In Salafist logic, all that territory has to be ""liberated"" so that it returns to Islamic control.
That is the explicit fight of Hamas or Al Qaeda. For this reason, they have always admitted that Israel ""is only the beginning.""
But that doesn't matter to Mullen, BECAUSE RACIST.

18. Mullen (and many like her; the woke, for example) ARE NOT WILLING TO GRANT that extremist Muslims have their own plans, their own agendas, their own beliefs and, at the deepest level, their own cultures.
In short, their own initiatives.

19. For Mullen, those Muslims ONLY REACT to what the West does. They have no reasoning or will of their own, and they limit themselves to waiting for stimuli to arrive from Europe or America, and simply reacting based on it.

20. That is why an aberrant question is asked: ""What have WE done for them to carry out their jihad?"" Obviously, because it is not their business, but US's. Because without US they would be doing nothing, or tending goats, or weaving rugs.
The issue is US, nothing more.

21. Do you realize how Mullen is rabidly EUROCENTRIC? She is incapable of conceding that a sector of Islam is capable of having bad, perverse, aggressive or imperialist ideas.
That is, she is incapable of granting them to be fully human (because that is all part of her).

22. Mullen is deeply racist. Her deepest conviction is that this is a world where only white people act, and everyone else only reacts. If the movement exists, if history exists, it is thanks to white people. Nothing else.

23. That's what's hidden behind woke goodism. The obsession with always being on the side of ""those who suffer"" arises from the idea that they, without that help, are worthless, do not achieve, nor have anything.
Political correctness is the racism of those who do not want to admit their racism.

24. The people who really are not racist are those who can recognize that an Afro, a Muslim, an Asian, a Hispanic, a dark-skinned person, a white person, a European, a Jew, an Arab, can be so good or so bad, as beautiful or as disgusting, as they themselves decide to be.

25. And, furthermore, they can say it without any remorse of conscience.
When you don't want the crimes of ""minorities"" or the ""oppressed"" to be pointed out, you are the racist.",27,Ok-Pack-8866,2023-11-25 23:15:44,183iiuh,,post,,israelhamaswar

"Hamas is ""nice"" to hostages.","Edit: Title should probably read ""Hamas is ""kind"" to hostages?"" Current title might suggest I think they are nice, I certainly do not.



All over social media people are showing the videos of Hamas and hostages waving to each other and saying goodbye etc:

One, in the video with the lady and little girl in the van, the Hamas dude audibly says ""keep waving"". 

Two, people are comparing these videos to two photos that supposedly show IDF arresting what looks to be two boys around age 10-14, with absolutely no context as to why they were being detained, to ""prove"" that Hamas are kind and humane and the IDF are the real terrorists. 

My question is this: Have any of you Palestine leaning people even considered the likelihood that they're under coercion to act this way? They are being told to wave as if to friends they're going to miss, while being released from captivity by masked ""militants"" carrying AK's. 

Have you even considered the fact that they might have been told to say favourable things to the media in exchange for the safety of other hostages, hostages they may even have gotten to know the past 50 days? In every video I've seen, the hostages look incredibly uncomfortable in my opinion , they look to be under duress. 

The idea that a video of waving ""proves"" terrorists who just committed a mass slaughter of civilians are actually kind and humane is insane to me. 

Also, do you think these people, who have just been through an extremely traumatic ideal no matter how you think Hamas treated them, not being forced in front of cameras really means Israel is trying to cover up the fact that Hamas are actually sensitive, compassionate individuals?",56,informationstation_,2023-11-26 16:33:35,1843m5l,,post,,israelpalestine

Just because they’re called “Palestinians” doesn’t entitle them to all of Palestine.,"1. America is a place, the name of two whole continents.  
2. There are people who are called “Americans.”  
3. Some Americans claim the right to rule all of America, but they are wrong.  
  
  
4. Palestine is a place, the name for the southern Levant.     
5. There are people who are called “Palestinians.”  
6. Some Palestinians claim the right to rule all of Palestine, but they are wrong.  
  


America, the two continents, acquired its name two and a half centuries before the country we call “America” came to be.  Yes, ever since the Monroe Doctrine many Americans have claimed a special privilege to dictate politics in the New World, but this is a mistaken policy.  Countries in Latin America have the right to decide their own fate.  
  


Palestine, from the river to the sea, has had that name since antiquity.  Herodotus calls it “Syria Palestina.” That doesn’t give Syrians or Palestinians any special claim to rule the region now.  Like it or not, part of Palestine is now Israel, another ancient name for the region, and the state of Israel is never going away.  Never.    
  


Naming one’s country after a region does not give a people any special political claim over the whole region.  Americans rule over part of America, and Palestinians will eventually rule over part of Palestine, if they can ever accept peace with Israel.

Message from one of the detainees to the fighters and leadership of the Al-Qassam Brigades who accompanied her during the period of detention prior to her release in a prisoner exchange deal as part of a humanitarian ceasefire.,"
To the generals who have accompanied me in recent weeks, it seems that we will part ways tomorrow, but I thank you from the bottom of my heart. 
For your extraordinary humanity that you have shown towards my daughter Emilia. 
You treated her like your own. You invited her to your room whenever she wanted. She acknowledges that you are all her friends, not just acquaintances. You are true and good loved ones. Thank you, thank you, thank you for the countless hours you spent as caregivers. Thank you for being patient with her and showering her with sweets, fruits, and everything available, even if it wasn't readily accessible. Children should not be in war zones, but thanks to you and other kind-hearted individuals we have encountered along the way, we found solace. My daughter considered herself a queen in Gaza. And overall, she acknowledges the feeling that she is the center of the world. 
We did not encounter a single person on our long journey, from the grassroots to the leadership, who did not treat her with kindness, tenderness, and love. I will forever be a captive of gratitude because she did not leave here with a permanent psychological trauma. 
I will mention to you your kind behavior, which was evident here despite the difficult situation you were dealing with yourselves, and the heavy losses that befell you here in Gaza. 
I wish in this world it was valued that we could be friends. I wish you all good health and well-being. 
Health and love to you and your families. 
Thank you very much.

Decided to wear my Star of David necklace in public. It didn’t go well.,"A couple of people told me “free Palestine” and one told me “f Israel,” all because I had a Star of David on. I didn’t say anything to them, no previous interaction, I just had a Jewish necklace. 

I assume these same people claim, “we’re anti Zionist, not antisemitic.” I thought Anti Zionists don’t go around harassing American Jews.(or any Jews, for that matter) 

What upsets me even more is that I feel like I’m screaming into an echo chamber with my experiences and concerns. Nobody believes me except for fellow Jews. And even then, there are only 16 million of us in the whole world. We’re outnumbered like crazy.

I want to wear my Star of David, I want to be proud, but I’m genuinely afraid now. I don’t know how Orthodox Jews/other visible Jews do it everyday. All I had was one necklace on for a day and I’m already scared. 

And I know some people may tell me, “poor you, you’re scared of wearing a necklace. Meanwhile Gazans are running scared for their lives.” 

I’m not denying that Gazans are afraid right now. As are Palestinians are around the world. But that doesn’t mean we have to invalidate the experiences of others. American Jews shouldn’t be harassed because of this. Heck, no Jews in the diaspora or in Israel should be harassed, just as no Palestinians in their diaspora or in Palestine should be harassed.

double standards.,"there are so many double standards in this conflict.

first, you have how being pro-Palestine doesn't have to mean you are pro-Hamas, yet being pro-Israel has to mean you are pro-government and support 100% of their actions. I'm pro israel. I hate the Israeli government. hundreds of thousands of israelis literally protested against the government for a full year, and they are still pro-Israel. there were also calls for ceasefire in israel too. those people are still pro-israel.

then you have people holding the idf responsible for the deaths of  gazan civilians. (which yes, makes sense.) but then they dont hold Hamas for the death of civilians they caused. idf blew up a hospital? hamas also did in Ashkelon. but israel actually cares about their civilians enough to protect them with cheva adom and building shelters everywhere. yes israel is responsible for not harming an insane amount of civilians. and if they do they should be condemned. but why is nobody condemning hamas for not caring about their own civilians? i cant see a justification for hamas even staying in power.

and lastly, the one that hurts the most. not believing israeli civilians. where were all women's rights organizations when israeli women were raped? where were they when girls were kidnapped to gaza? i havent seen a single international women's organization speak out on behalf of israeli women. are they lying? but there is so much evidence. and wasnt it believe until proven wrong? why are so many people denying oct7 when hamas themselves filmed it? i understand being against how israel responded. fine you are entitled to your own opinion. but dont deny such a horrific event. overall it just hurts me to see people denying the horrible acts commited against these poor women. and civilians in general.

This one gets me too, as a victim of rape i am disgusted by people outright denying it happened. Ive been banned from multiple subs (like r/WhitePeopleTwitter and r/ABoringDystopia) for simply MENTIONING the rapes. Aboringdystopia mods accused me of lying, of spreading misinformation. Then when they asked for proof i shared it with them and they MUTED ME. Even r/WitchesVsPatriarchy, i was an active member of that sub, sharing love and support. I mentioned the rapes, i mentioned how i dont want a ceasefire until the hostages (or at least the women and children) are returned. They accused me of not caring about palestinians and banned me. Honestly never thought id see witchesvspatriarchy FUCKING SIDING WITH THE PATRIARCHY

When boko haram kidnapped all those girls people were hashtagging BringBackOurGirls for months (not that it did any good, but still showed someone cared). Nobody gives a fuck about israelis. Right now hamas admits they dont know where all the hostages are. The men are probably dead or tortured. I genuinely fear for what is happening to the women and children.

The gang then start doing things like covering the building in toilet paper to get back at him.
The Israeli guy then puts a fence around the bar so the guy then resort to creating a threatening jihad-like video and then throw a flaming bag of dog poop through the window which ends up blowing up the building.

Human Rights Watch published an article “Findings on October 17 al-Alhi Hospital Explosion”,"“(Jerusalem) – The explosion that killed and injured many civilians at al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza on October 17, 2023, resulted from an apparent rocket-propelled munition, such as those commonly used by Palestinian armed groups, that hit the hospital grounds, Human Rights Watch said today. While misfires are frequent, further investigation is needed to determine who launched the apparent rocket and whether the laws of war were violated.

At 6:59 p.m. that day, a type of munition that Human Rights Watch has not been able to conclusively identify hit a paved area inside the hospital compound, between a parking lot and a landscaped area where many civilians congregated to seek safety from Israeli strikes. The Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that 471 people were killed and 342 injured. Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate the count, which is significantly higher than other estimates, displays an unusually high killed-to-injured ratio, and appears out of proportion with the damage visible on site”

"I'm pro Palestine, I still can't see how ""from the river to the sea"" can be anything but hateful","When you look at what's going on, I think it's pretty clear that Israel has no real interest in diplomatic solutions and would rather use violent outbreaks to justify claiming more territory. 

I think it's right that we should put pressure on our own governments to put pressure on Israel to seek out peaceful solutions. 

I don't see how the slogan ""from the river to the sea Palestine shall be free"" does that. 

It's no secret that various factions (including Hamas) campaign to strip Israelis from their rights to be in the region, effectively calling for mass displacement, if not genocide. This slogan certainly lends itself to this cause (free as in free of unwanted occupiers).

,"Saying that Israel is not looking for other solutions is just wrong. The two state solution has been offered to the Palestinian side multiple times and rejected each time because “from the river to the sea”. Bear in mind there was a ceasefire on October 6th and the Palestinian side broke it. Hamas is the one who does not look for any diplomatic solution. In 2017 they agreed to 1967 boarders without recognising Israel as a state. Meaning they would get a Palestinian state , but continue violence against Israel and continue the ongoing war. This is not a peace solution. This will change absolutely nothing , just establishing a state of Palestine, which will continue it’s violence. 

The goal of the current war is to 
- get rid of Hamas 
- rebuild Gaza with the aid of Israel , USA and the UN , including deradicalization , eduction system promoting peace and not glorifying death 
- move onto peace solutions. The Israeli side is already discussing with the Palestinian side a two-state solution, with a creation of Palestinian state including West Bank , Gaza and East Jerusalem, with a general election done later. If election is done now , they will vote for someone like Hamas again since 70% of Palestinians in the West Bank (there was a poll done recently) support October 7th and violence against Jews. 

Ceasefire right now is not a solution. Hamas remains in power and repeats October 7th. There’s no ceasefire until Hamas is no longer in power. 

The argument pro-Palestinians use is “just kill the leaders in Qatar”. Qatar is the communication between Hamas and Israel. Qatar has been doing negotiations about hostages and etc. and one of the points in peace agreement between Israel and Qatar and Qatar remaining the inbetweener is that Mossad will not assassinate anyone on the Qatari soil. Israel has promised Qatar that there will not be assassination of any of the Hamas leaders on Qatari soil. 

We Israelis have been protesting against our government for a year and most support Yair Lapid , who’s primary goal is to set up a two-state solution. We do not want Gaza, we left Gaza nearly 20 years ago, but we want Gaza not to be a threat to us. 

Both Israelis and Palestinians deserve their own state , dignity , freedom, safety and high standard of life. This is not hate speech. Opposing any of that statement is. 

Palestinians deserve a government which takes care of them , provides for them, gives them safety and stability, instead of using them as human shields. 

Hamas had huge investments coming into Gaza, with that amount of money they could’ve built a Middle Eastern Singapore and provide a high standard of life for its citizens. Instead they chose investing into rockets and arms, continuously attacking a country with one of the strongest armies in the world knowing exactly what the response would be , using their people as human shields , forcing people to stay in unsafe areas in order to increase civilian deaths and cry out to the world. 30% of Hamas rockets fired towards Israel misfire and land in Gaza. When you talk about civilian death toll in Gaza you have to ask yourself a couple questions:
- how many of those civilians , were actually Hamas terrorists? 
- how many of those civilians died from Hamas rockets 
- how many of those civilians died from working on a rocket production (a lot of people die because of this in Gaza) 
- how many of those civilians died for other reasons - like health reasons, old age etc. 
- how exaggerated are the numbers : the hospital bombing which turned out to be a Hamas rockets , supposedly killed 500 people (Hamas gave that number after 10 minutes , it is impossible to count 500 dead bodies , and make sure that they are dead in such amount of time). The hospital bombing turned out to be a Hamas rocket ( Israel has showed proof , Hamas said they’ll show proof but end up not being able to fake their evidence and said the rocket “dissolved like salt in water”)and turned out to be a parking lot bombing , with 50 deaths , the death toll in Hamas records is still 500. And this is just one example. Yes civilians are dying , however believing Hamas numbers is not it.  

Hamas puts all those numbers as “died from Israeli rockets” 

And I wanna point out again both nations deserve dignity, freedom and safety. You can be pro-Israel and pro-Palestine it’s not mutually exclusive. Demonisation of Zionism is a whole other topic.

"Why do palestinians think they can murder, steal land and keep it?","In the 1929 Hebron Massacre the so called palestinians murdered 67 Jews and stole their land and the palestinians still to this day think it belongs to them. Jews have 3% of Hebron and yet someone on here posted of someone saying that the palestinians are restricted and can’t go on certain streets, other way around mostly.

In the 1948 Kfar Etzion massacre the palestinians murdered 127 Jews and stole their land, and the palestinians call the Jewish residents who returned after 1967 “illegal settlers on stolen palestinian land”

All the Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem that were established in the 1800s are considered “illegal settlements” because of a Jordanian ethnic cleansing in the 1948 war which resulted in an armistice.

The palestinians desire everything inside the Armistice lines as theirs, even when it specifically says “No provision of this Agreement shall in any way prejudice the rights, claims and positions of either Party hereto (Israel and Jordan) in the ultimate peaceful settlement of the Palestine question, the provisions of this Agreement being dictated exclusively by military considerations.”

The Jordanian occupation and ethnic cleansing was illegal

Therefore the Jews who live on land they purchased in the 1800s or before are not illegal settlers stealing palestinian land. It was never palestinian land.

Families Reunite,"In the past few days so many incredibly emotional videos have been circulating showing families,  both Israeli and Palestinians, reuniting.

In each of these I see the same thing, families and friends crying and celebrating, hugging the people they thought they had lost forever tightly. It is truly beautiful to see how similiar everyone is and makes the ongoing conflict all the more depressing.

These two populations have witnessed so much violence against each other and are both lead by extremist governments. I dont want to debate which is worse because neither is an innocent. Hamas's actions on Oct 7th are unforgivable and Israel's policies for Palestinians are exceeding harsh, 20 years jail time for throwing stones is no joke.

,"I used to be Pro-Palestine, but I now support Israel. 

The main reasons I swapped sides was because I had never really looked deeply into the situation until the October 7th attacks. 

It was then that I realised how toxic Palestinian culture is.  When I saw them celebrate and spit on the naked body of a young woman as their own military paraded her through the streets like a war trophy. 

And that was the least terrible thing the Palestinian government did that day. 

This shattered my world view of Palestinians being victims fighting the oppression of Israel.  How were they being oppressed by that poor woman?  

So I looked back at the history of Israel and Palestine, and  I discovered that Palestine were the aggressors to Israel, starting multiple wars and invading them on multiple occasions, all because they wanted Isreal to themselves and to ""push the Jews into the sea"".  A goal that is still a pro-Palestine chant ""from the river, to the sea"". 

It's fair to say, when you start a territorial war, you risk loosing your territory if you loose.  Palestine always lost, that doesn't make Israel the bad guys. 

I read about all the suicide bombings and rocket attacks from Palestine towards Israel, with the goal of terrorising them and presumably, starting more wars.  I understand now why Isreal built that wall, why they monitor what goods come through their country. 

I read about how Palestine elected Hamas, whose entire charter is about eliminating Israel, by killing all the Jews, and reads like a Muslim version of Mein Kampf.  I understand why Israel still occupies The West Bank. 

I read about how, despite the threat of violence, Israel has provided free electricity and billions in funding to Palestine as a gesture of goodwill.   How, despite ongoing terrorist attacks, Israel allows thousands of Palestinians to cross the border for work, study and medical treatment.  They also allowed thousands of Palestinians to work for Israel remotely, lifting them out of poverty. 

When I look back at the history of Jews in Palestine prior to 1948, I saw them being used as scapegoats by the Palestinians for the effects of The Great Depression. Much like immigrants are used as scapegoats for societies problems today. I saw the Arabs repeatedly attacking them and forming militant groups against them, for merely existing. 

***I am pro-immigration and believe immigrants make nations better. I don't blame them for 'housing shortages' or 'taking jobs', this is on the government.  

When I read about the UN partition plan, I understood the reason was to keep the Jews safe from the Arabs.  Especially after the Hebron massacre.  I realised the the Arabs were already given 77% of the British Mandate in the form of Jordan, and the Israeli partition was mostly desert and didn't include the historic Jewsish settlements of Judea and Samaria. 

When I read about why the Jews migrated to Israel/Palestine, I realised they had no choice.  They were expelled from the Arab nations they had lived in for centuries (since they left Israel), they were being massacred, having they homes taken. And we all know about the European Holocast. I acknowledged that they also have a strong historical claim to Israel and a continuous culture, which was founded by the Jews in 1050 BC.  They are indigenous to Israel. 

When I read about the Nakba and the war of independence, I understood that it was caused by Palestine rejecting the UN Partition plan and attacking Isreal.  It was fought village to village, and in the end, the Arab villages who didn't violently attack the Jews were made Isreali citizens and the ones who did attack were expelled.  Which is a lot kinder than being executed or put in prison.

I read about the many peace deals that were rejected by Palestine, because, despite loosing fair and square, they still want ALL of Israel.  

I see how the Palestinians cling to their victimhood, and fester hate towards the Jews.  Focusing on war and missing every opportunity at nation building and peace.  I see the success of Germany and Japan, after suffering worse losses and realise that the problem isn't Israel, it's Palestine.  It's always been Palestine.",1,ladyskullz,2023-11-28 12:45:31,kb24e4x,,comment,t3_185c00q,israelpalestine
,"For me, neither jews, nor arabs had a claimto these lands. There is no right to return for most people and neither jews nor arabs are indigenous to the lands.

Jews were invaders, it says so in the torah

Arabs are colonizers. Look at egypt. They have to call it the arab republic of egypt because they are so far removed from the people who built the pyramids

The area that was the british mandate was called palestine in which arabs, jews, lebanese, druze, armenians, turkfolk etc., lived. There was no palestine national identity ever. But there was a plan to have a jewish state. I'll fast forward to 1947 where a civil war between jews and arabs was looming because the british, tired of terror by the zionists were leaving. 1948 israel was founded and arabs attacked.

And israel won the war. Not only that but also all subsequent wars. Over 60+ million arabs failed to genocide 2 million jews. And for me, that's where israel gets his right to exist. They fought for it with blood. The arabs fled because they were afraid or didnt want to live under jewish rule. Those who stayed enjoy israelite citizenship with all the perks, living in freedom under a democracy.

Whatever claim arab / palestinian had to the land, they lost in the wars. egypt didn't want them, jordan didn't want them and israel of course also didn't want them. The palestinians in gaza and westbank were never able to form stable government that actualyl governs. Like making laws, pass a budget, a supreme court, establish a check and balance system, etc.. They don't know how and have little interest. That means that Israel is deserving all the more of protection since it's the only democracy in sea of arab muslim failure states.

When people call for free palestine, they never ask for the jordanian palestine also to be freed. Why is that? It's because it was never about some palestinian people, it was about jews not getting jerusalem.

,"First and foremost Jewish is an ethnicity and religion. There are non-religious ethnically Jewish people. When you take a genetic test it says Jewish. Mine is 100% Jewish. Again Jewish is an ethnicity it’s a nationality , Jewish people share the same genetic code, the same way that English do , French do , Indians do , Chinese do etc.  Now I’m just gonna copy paste something I wrote earlier today which is my opinion on basically everything. 

Saying that Israel is not looking for other solutions is just wrong. The two state solution has been offered to the Palestinian side multiple times and rejected each time because “from the river to the sea”. Bear in mind there was a ceasefire on October 6th and the Palestinian side broke it. Hamas is the one who does not look for any diplomatic solution. In 2017 they agreed to 1967 boarders without recognising Israel as a state. Meaning they would get a Palestinian state , but continue violence against Israel and continue the ongoing war. This is not a peace solution. This will change absolutely nothing , just establishing a state of Palestine, which will continue it’s violence.

The goal of the current war is to

•	⁠get rid of Hamas

•	⁠rebuild Gaza with the aid of Israel , USA  and the UN (even Elon Mask said it today during his visit to Israel) , including deradicalization , eduction system promoting peace and not glorifying death

•	⁠move onto peace solutions. The Israeli side is already discussing with the Palestinian side a two-state solution, with a creation of Palestinian state including West Bank , Gaza and East Jerusalem, with a general election done later. If election is done now , they will vote for someone like Hamas again since 70% of Palestinians in the West Bank (there was a poll done recently) support October 7th and violence against Jews.

Ceasefire right now is not a solution. Hamas remains in power and repeats October 7th. There’s no ceasefire until Hamas is no longer in power.

The argument pro-Palestinians use is “just kill the leaders in Qatar”. Qatar is the communication between Hamas and Israel. Qatar has been doing negotiations about hostages and etc. and one of the points in peace agreement between Israel and Qatar and Qatar remaining the inbetweener is that Mossad will not assassinate anyone on the Qatari soil. Israel has promised Qatar that there will not be assassination of any of the Hamas leaders on Qatari soil.

We Israelis have been protesting against our government for a year and most support Yair Lapid , whose primary goal is to set up a two-state solution. We do not want Gaza, we left Gaza nearly 20 years ago, but we want Gaza not to be a threat to us.

Both Israelis and Palestinians deserve their own state , dignity , freedom, safety and high standard of life. This is not hate speech. Opposing any of that statement is.

Palestinians deserve a government which takes care of them , provides for them, gives them safety and stability, instead of using them as human shields.

Hamas had huge investments coming into Gaza, with that amount of money they could’ve built a Middle Eastern Singapore and provide a high standard of life for its citizens. Instead they chose investing into rockets and arms, continuously attacking a country with one of the strongest armies in the world knowing exactly what the response would be , using their people as human shields , forcing people to stay in unsafe areas in order to increase civilian deaths and cry out to the world. 30% of Hamas rockets fired towards Israel misfire and land in Gaza. When you talk about civilian death toll in Gaza you have to ask yourself a couple questions:

•	⁠how many of those civilians , were actually Hamas terrorists?

•	⁠how many of those civilians died from Hamas rockets

•	⁠how many of those civilians died from working on a rocket production (a lot of people die because of this in Gaza)

•	⁠how many of those civilians died for other reasons - like health reasons, old age etc.

•	⁠how exaggerated are the numbers : the hospital bombing which turned out to be a Hamas rockets , supposedly killed 500 people (Hamas gave that number after 10 minutes , it is impossible to count 500 dead bodies , and make sure that they are dead in such amount of time). The hospital bombing turned out to be a Hamas rocket ( Israel has showed proof , Hamas said they’ll show proof but end up not being able to fake their evidence and said the rocket “dissolved like salt in water”)and turned out to be a parking lot bombing , with 50 deaths , the death toll in Hamas records is still 500. And this is just one example. Yes civilians are dying , however believing Hamas numbers is not it.

Hamas puts all those numbers as “died from Israeli rockets”

And I wanna point out again both nations deserve dignity, freedom and safety. You can be pro-Israel and pro-Palestine it’s not mutually exclusive. 

Demonisation of Zionism is a whole other topic. Saying “go back from where you came from” is literally Zionism. Claiming that we came from Europe is literally just effed up. There are Asian , Hispanic , black, Middle Eastern and European Jews. Jews come in all colours. My family for example has been exiled from Iran and moved to Azerbaijan and Georgia and came back to our ancestral home. I have dark long curly hair, think dark eyebrows, brown skin and black eyes. My genetic test had discovered a 100% mizrachim blood, meaning I’m noting but a Jew. One of my very dark Black and Jewish friends has been called a white coloniser by pro-Palestinian protestors in USA college and was told to go back to Europe, for wearing a kippah and tzitzit. He is black. It’s Black Lives Matter until they are Black and Jewish. All Jews have strong ties to Israel. All our religious holy cites are in Israel. We came back to where we came from , we have been exiled multiple times and came back. 


I am a proud Jewish , Israeli , Zionist and pro-Palestinian rights. Both groups deserve to live in peace and prosperity in two separate states alongside each other. And the reason I say two separate states and not one is because I personally do not believe that we can live in one state in peace alongside each other it will never work. Both groups deserved to be recognised by one another and the world , both states deserve to be recognised by each other and the world and again, both groups deserve dignity , freedom , prosperity and safety.

I am heartbroken for civilian deaths in Gaza and for them I also pray. Every normal person wants peace, not war. 

I recommend educating yourself on Jewish and Israeli history before you make any claims. Jews are indigenous  to the land of Israel and even in Quran it says that the land of Israel is given to Jews.",1,Ibmademecry_,2023-11-28 10:31:56,kb1kr05,,comment,t3_185c00q,israelpalestine

,"So here is why I personally support Israel.

My family comes from Lithuania in Eastern Europe. Europe created this cycle where they would allows Jews to immigrate to their countries, accuse them of blood libel or having too much money because they were often barred from occupations not pertaining to usury, then expelling them. Personally my family was expelled in 1915 from our homes by the Russian Empire for fear we would side with the Germans in WWI because we spoke Yiddish. They were sent to live in Astrakhan, Russia. Then upon returning, they had to buy new homes, and lived under an independent Lithuanian government. In 1940, the Soviet Union invaded Lithuania and forces communism onto the population. Then in 1941 Germany invades, and convinces our Lithuanian neighbors to round us up into ghettoes and have us executed in the woods for inventing communism. 9 direct members of my family were murdered in the woods by Germans and Lithuanians, and they were mostly elderly and children under the age of 13. This doesn't count the extended family I will never know about. They were murdered in pits where they were forced to undress and lay on top or each other and then shot. 10,230 other Jews are buried in the same mass grave as my ancestors. It's just one site out of hundreds across Europe.  My great-grandfather had already left Lithuania in 1910, and so did his sister in 1911. Their only other sibling that survived the war did so by running away to Kazakhstan with her husband, and he enlisted in the Soviet Army. Upon my great-aunt's return to their home, no one was left. Lithuania was yet again transformed into a Soviet Communist state. My grandfather's cousins, her sons, grew up in Soviet Lithuania until migrating to Israel in the 80s. Why did they migrate to Israel? Because it was better than living in a den of wolves under the Soviets. To this day, Lithuania denies being complicit and committing the murder of 95% of its Jews during WWII. Obviously living in Europe was no longer a viable option for Jews. This is just what happened in the 20th century. We had lived there for at least 7 generations prior that I can trace. This is probably the most notable persecution against my family that is recorded. So it doesn't count what happened with all the pogroms before that. 

I'm a 4th generation immigrant to America. I grew up in a community where I was one of two Jewish kids in the school system. I experienced antisemitic bullying regularly. Throughout my entire life I have had to sit through conversations with people who don't realize I'm Jewish while they make antisemitic comments, praise Hitler, say the Holocaust is fake, or make jokes about the mass murder of my ancestors. Neo-Nazis are present in my state and protest, dessiminate antisemitic material (like claiming covid-19 was a Jewish conspiracy), and spread hate. The Nazis didn't die in 1945. Nazim was popular among Americans before WWII, and its still relevant today. 

So here's how Israel ties in. Every major ethnic group is naturally given the idea that they have a right to their historic lands. The Italians have Italy. The Russians have Russia. The Spanish have Spain. But Jews are an ethnic group, not just a religion. It's true anyone can convert to Judaism, but Jewish is an ethnic identity for people whose ancestors migrated from the Levant to all across the world; the Diaspora. So we have established that major ethnic groups are readily recognized with their right to govern themselves and have a national identity. Jews wanted this thing for a long time. Meanwhile we have spent the last 2,000 years as a minority everywhere we go and readily become scapegoats anytime something goes wrong in a country. Laws probibiting what we could do were passed. This is especially true for Jews who lived in predominantly Muslim countries across the Middle East and North Africa, not just Jews in Europe. The experience was both different and the same. Anywhere Jews have lived, it was always as a minority with varying amounts of rights and political power. Theoretically, a Jewish state would mean an end to this dynamic by allowing the Jewish people to control their own destiny. It's the same thing Palestinians want. To live and govern themselves. It's all any national identity desires. 

So why do I support Israel? It's a place where Jews don't live under oppressive regimes where they live as minorities, they have rights that can't be revoked at the flick of a duke's pen, and Jewish culture is celebrated in its birthplace. Members of my family live there. My friends live there. There's no White Supremacists claiming we're trying to breed them out of existence and replace them. There's no Islamic authority telling us we can't build our homes taller than a Muslim's house. No one makes us pay a tax for practicing our religion. 

Israel is definitely not a utopia. I can still support Israel and be vehemently against some of its policies. I can still denounce Israelis and Diaspora Jews who spread bigotry and call for political or religious violence. 

The argument you brought up about there being many Arab countries, I don't really subscribe to. But Israel isn't really a country based on just religion. Many religions exist there, just as you mentioned there are in Arabic countries.",1,gxdsavesispend,2023-11-28 08:47:01,kb1472f,,comment,t3_185c00q,israelpalestine
Why Aren't all the Palestinians Dead?,"If Israel is committing genocide, why isn't everyone in Gaza dead?  Israel has the capability, they can easily do it.  Serious question for all the Pro Palestinians screaming genocide at the top of their lungs.  Israel has had 70 years to wipe Palastians off the map. They easily could have done it with conventional warfare, or just committed ethnic cleansing when they controlled Gaza before 2005. Gaza's population went from 400k in the 60's to over 2 million at present. They are the 39th fastest population in the world.  Seems to me Israel is not very good at this genocide thing. 

&#x200B;

To come back to reality for a second, Israel is fighting a war.  Civilians die in wars 100% of the time. That's a fact. Israel is not carpet bombing Gaza, not even close.  If you want to see what real carpet bombing is, go look at the Allie bombing campaign of Germany in WW2, Russia's seiges of Ukraine and Bosnia, or even the US's shock and awe approach in Iraq.  It's ironic that there wasn't a cry of disapproval when the US killed over 400k in Afghanistan/ Iraq.

What the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said about Emily...,"Hand was released along with 12 other Israelis Saturday in the second stage of a 4-part exchange deal with Hamas that included a lull in the fighting that erupted following the attack as Israel vowed to topple the terror group that rules Gaza.

“This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family,” Varadkar’s official account tweeted on X, formerly Twitter. “An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned, and we breathe a massive sigh of relief. Our prayers have been answered.”

,"This, and the faux outrage and condemnation from the Irish about the supposed innocence and good faith of PM Varadkar’s obvious pious trollery brings to mind this part of Sartre’s famous essay “Antisemite and the Jew”:

“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”",1,jackl24000,2023-11-28 10:18:20,kb1ipfw,,comment,t3_185dcci,israelpalestine
"I am from israel, is a jew and zionist, ask me anything!","firstly some rules:

1. no just yelling at me for no reason, i get it dude me the individual is bad for being a jew and zionist now go take your yelling somewhere else.
2. i would rather you shorten your questions to a list and not a text block, ill still read your text blocks but i might not respond because of the sheer length
3. ill put a small FAQ down below so i dont have to answer the same question a million times.

&#x200B;

FAQ:

Are you homophobic? nah m8

Do you endorse what the IDF does? While i believe in the general cause of eraddiacting hamas as a military orginization, both sides loose men in the fight. And both side's families weep over their deaths. But in the end some things have to be done. (dont think i encourage murder, and i do think palestinians having to be moved from their homes is bad).

What do you think of the land that got stolen? We aquired the land through a democratic vote and yes we did take the homes after the war in 1948, and you know its bad to take people homes and such but in the end they attacked us and well..

With that being said, ask me anything!

I just would like to read your opinion on some points I have seen in speeches analyzing the internal politics of Israel:

- is netanyahyu that unpopular? Or was he unpopular prior to the attacks?

- is it true that a big part of the secularized jew population begins to be pissed that the extra-religious take huge amounts of public money and don't contribute other than the study of their texts? I've heard rent costs also are huge in Tel Aviv, like in no other western big city.

I need to vent about tiktok and then take a mini vacation from social media,"I've done some research on the topic and I've found arguments that support China backing Iran and therefore Hamas in this conflict. I've also found arguments that support China not giving a flying eff about the conflict. 

Ive commented on this recently but to recap: I'm a tiktokker. I live on that app and I've had to leave that app bc I can't seem to (1) get on and (2) stay on the Israel side of tiktok. 

I support Palestine becoming free from Hamas. But ""pro Palestinian"" accounts on tiktok are thinly veiled propoganda attacks against Israel by uneducated young  (mostly) american ""adults"". And i do comment on these videos and i do push back (as do others) so that while we rarely get anywhere, our pushback might give some malleable young person pause before assuming it's a global trend to be 100% against Israel.  Without pushback, the propaganda over there is running unchecked like a cancer (as it more or less already is with or without pushback).  And it's social media and its stupid but it's shaping how people view the middle east in the most twisted and sick way (example: a large number of these tik toks are pro Osama bin Laden. And these are posts from Gen Z americans. Pro osama bin laden!).

Most of these tiktoks are really just ugly hate attacks positioned as being pro Palestinian. And they rack up millions of views and hundreds of thousands of likes - some in the millions. Whereas people posting tiktoks in defense of Israel get half the views and half the likes. 

While I don't typically concern myself with likes and views, I constantly see ppl posting comments to the effect of ""pro palestine tiktoks get the most likes so they're obviously right."" Rather than following history or logic, people are following views and like count and forming their views around those metrics as opposed to history and substance. 

And it really scares the shit out me. And 9/10 tiktoks are being posted by Gen Z Americans. I'm a liberal millennial American myself and this is the closest I've been aligned to conservative ideology in my life. Our republican party in this country tried and failed to have tiktok banned.  I am very quickly coming around in support of having tiktok banned if the algorithm is intentionally pushing propoganda (when I naively joined tiktok in the first place for the hilarious cat videos). Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump - two of the most polarizing figures in politics representing opposite sides of the american political spectrum - both support Israel. But all these blind morons on tiktok care about is the opinion of a Victoria's Secret model. No critical thinking skills.

I interact with pro palestine and pro Israeli content - that gives their content a view boost. I comment/follow/favorite/repost Israeli or anti-hamas content - each engagement should boost that account and help the algorithm fine tune what to show me while increasing engagement for that content.
I fight with pro-hamas content creators, I get reported, and get blocked which should reduce how frequently that type of content is being shown to me. And yet I actively have to work to stay on the Israel side of tiktok. 

Is there a possibility this is intentional? That the algorithm is deliberately pushing propoganda? Or is that unfounded conspiracy theory? I don't know. I'm genuinely asking. I researched China's POV but I didn't go too deep. And I found arguments to support both.

Either way I am taking a few days off from social media.",15,Ella77214,2023-11-28 15:45:37,185nug0,,post,,israelpalestine

Whether it’s just for show for views or not I’m not sure but the idea is that every single time something happens these kids are ALWAYS on the wrong side of things.

,"Both of them were released on Friday? What’s your point? Every person who has been released thus far, including the Thai workers, has had nothing negative to say and has looked like they were treated well and we know that they were also provided with medical help when necessary. Even on an Israeli news show they said after the release of the captives yesterday that the harsh criticism to Yocheved (the old lady who gave the big press conf after being released) was unwarranted and that their testimonies are all the same. Sure, we might consider it a fake letter, but no one has sad anything negative thus far. I just find it strange how people even refuse to accept the idea that it’s not impossible for the hostages to be treated humanely by Qassam. I doubt all of them are lying and even if someone spoke out against them for some reason, then they wouldn’t kill anyone, since the hostages are more valuable to Hamas than the Israeli government, as they can be used as leverage in peace talks and in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.",23,hamzatbek,2023-11-28 06:18:09,kb0fp7g,,comment,t1_kb0ehm6,AskMiddleEast

,"All of this is true, but even as someone who is heavily Zionist and pro-Israel I can tell you that this timeline isn't all that important to the any kind of mainstream narrative (at least by those who know anything about the situation).

The Palestinians exist as a group, today.  They are identifiable and exist as a people just like many other groups exist as a people, even if they do not have a state of their own.  How we got here just isn't all that important.

What is important is that the Palestinians and the Israelis cannot both coexist under a single country that goes across all of modern day Israel and the territories (and Palestine, however one would define it).  This is true for a variety of reasons.  The Palestinians are not going to disappear and neither will Israel.  And this is why either a 2-state solution or an emirates-like solution is all that will work.

if you don't think it makes sense to kill and forcibly deport all the jews from their homes, then maybe you should call out against such chants, as they don't coincide with your values. this sort of slogan is exactly why no peace agreement can be reached and why the violence seems perpetual.

for those that will say that israel deported palestinians from their homes back in 1948 and 1967: (lets ignore the fact that israel didn't deport the palestinians, but has always given citizenship to palestinians in annexed territory.) most israelis today weren't alive yet at the time of these wars. blaming me and my peers for something our grandparents did makes no sense and has no justification.

Israel got a pile of dust and turned it into a thriving country. They've been attacked numerous times and thrown back the attackers.

The ones on the other side are generational losers who ruin everything good that they have access to. They have leaders who live in luxury while they eat garbage and accept it.",1,Vad220894,2023-11-28 18:14:12,kb37l11,,comment,t1_kb366un,israelhamaswar
